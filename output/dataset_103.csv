      Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Before me for sentence are three young men: Georgeus Kari, Jamal Hamid, and an offender who was a juvenile at the relevant time and who will be identified simply as “H”. All three were to stand trial for the murder of Matthew Hughan at Telopea on 8 May 2003. However, the Crown Prosecutor accepted pleas of guilty to manslaughter by Kari and the juvenile offender in satisfaction of the indictment. In Hamid’s case, a plea of guilty to accessory after the fact to manslaughter was accepted. Hamid asked that a related offence of causing danger with a firearm be taken into account on a Form 1, and he also pleaded guilty to an unrelated home invasion offence, that is, entering a dwelling house in company with intent to steal. Kari was also involved in that home invasion offence, and he asked that it be taken into account on a Form 1. The juvenile offender also has a Form 1 matter, an unrelated offence of robbery in company. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    2 I shall deal first with the events surrounding the death of the unfortunate Matthew Hughan, who was only twenty-one years old. In the early hours of 8 May 2003, the three offenders and another man, Ahmed Dib, went to the home at Telopea where the deceased lived with his mother and his sisters. It seems that both Dib and the deceased were drug dealers, and Dib wanted to “shut down” the deceased’s business. The expression “shut down” meant to stop a rival drug dealer from trading. The offenders accompanied Dib to help him in this enterprise. Dib had in his possession a police baton which he had stolen from a police vehicle, while in the company of the juvenile offender and another man, some hours earlier. The juvenile had a small pistol, with which he intended to menace the deceased as part of the “shut down”. 
     
      
    3 Dib, Kari and the juvenile offender attempted to gain entry to the house by banging on the front door or kicking it. The juvenile handed the pistol to Kari, so that he could kick the door more effectively. That was the first that Kari knew of the pistol, and he was unaware of its condition and operation, including whether it had a safety catch. The deceased opened the door, and there was an argument and a brief struggle. He was assaulted by the juvenile and by Dib, who used the baton. During the struggle, in panic, Kari fired the pistol. He did so by a voluntary act, but without the intention to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. The deceased was struck in the chest area by a single bullet and collapsed. He died in hospital about 30 minutes later.  
     
      
    4 During this incident Hamid remained on the driveway of the house, a few metres from the front door. After the deceased was shot all four men ran from the house. A friend and neighbour of the deceased, who had heard the shot fired while he was walking home, pursued them. By this time Hamid had the pistol, although how he had come into possession of it is not clear from the material before me. He fired it twice in the direction of their pursuer, without harming him. It was this act which gave rise to the charge of causing danger with a firearm on Hamid’s Form 1. 
     
      
    5 The criminal enterprise was the initiative of Dib and, for what significance it might have, the offenders were reluctant participants in it. The basis of the pleas of guilty to manslaughter by Kari and the juvenile offender is that they participated in the venture contemplating the possibility that, in the course of it, some harm falling short of grievous bodily harm might be inflicted upon the deceased. 
     
      
    6 As I have said, Hamid’s liability is as an accessory after the fact to manslaughter, that is, providing assistance to the principal offenders to evade justice. His liability is founded, firstly, upon his helping the others to make good their escape after the shooting. After evading their pursuer, they separated. Hamid arranged for them to go to the home of an associate about a kilometre away. He later phoned each of them to ensure that, after leaving that associate’s home, they had got away from the area. In the following days, he encouraged them to arrange false identities to leave the country. He went with the juvenile offender to the home of another man, who had driven them to the vicinity of the deceased’s house and might have had some knowledge of what had occurred, to ensure that he said nothing to police or anyone else about the shooting. He also supported and encouraged the juvenile offender to get money to leave the country, so as to avoid detection and arrest.  
     
      
    7 On different dates towards the middle of 2003, all three offenders left Australia to travel to Lebanon, although there is no evidence before me that any of them used a false identity to do so. I shall return to that matter when I deal with each of their subjective cases. 
     
      
       
      Unrelated Offences 
       
      
    8 The home invasion to which Hamid pleaded guilty, and which Kari asked to be taken into account on a Form 1, took place at a house at Rooty Hill at about 12.15am on 11 December 2002. The victim, Craig Channels, was visiting a friend of his, Ahmed Diab. Both Kari and Hamid knew Channels and they went to the house in the company of two other men. 
     
      
    9 The four of them entered the house and demanded cash and Channels’ car, a Mitsubishi Lancer. Kari assaulted Diab and, when he came to his aid, Channels was also assaulted by all four men. He was kicked and punched a number of times before he managed to get outside and hide in the garden of a neighbour’s house. Diab also managed to get away after he threatened the men with a cricket bat. The men left without taking the car or any cash. 
     
      
    10 Police and ambulance officers attended the house. Channels was later treated at hospital, where a laceration to his head was sutured and he was treated for a broken nose. He also suffered significant bruising to his body. 
     
      
    11 The robbery in company offence which the juvenile offender asks to be taken into account on a Form 1 was committed in the early hours of 7 May 2003, the day before the manslaughter of Matthew Hughan. The offender and two accomplices drove to the BP Service Station at Silverwater in a car which the accomplices had previously stolen. The offender parked the car near the service station and remained in it while the accomplices entered the service station. The victim was working alone as the cashier. The accomplices took hold of him, told him to be quiet and menaced him by raising their clenched fists near his face. They produced a doona cover, and had the victim hold it open while they filled it with packets of cigarettes from a rack behind the counter. 
     
      
    12 The victim dropped the doona cover and escaped through a rear door into the garage area of the service station. He activated a hold-up alarm. In the meantime the juvenile offender had driven the car to the front door of the service station. The accomplices had about 90 packets of cigarettes in the doona cover. They got into the car and the three of them made their escape. 
     
      
       
      Victim Impact Statement 
       
      
    13 A victim impact statement was prepared by Matthew Hughan’s mother and sister. His mother read the statement to the court on two occasions, as the proceedings on sentence in respect of Kari took place on a different day from those relating to the other two offenders. It is an eloquent expression of their grief and outrage at the untimely death of their loved one, who was such a young man, and of the enduring effects of this tragedy upon their lives and the lives of other members of the family. I approach the statement in accordance with established authority. I expressed my deepest sympathy to Mrs Hughan and to the family on each occasion the statement was read, and I do so again now. 
     
      
       
      Subjective Cases 
       
       
      Kari 
       
      
    14 Georgeus Kari was born on 14 December 1983. He was eighteen years old at the time of the home invasion offence and nineteen at the time of the manslaughter. He is now twenty-four. He has a criminal history, comprising offences committed between 2001 and 2003. For the most part, they are drug offences, offences of dishonesty and traffic offences. There is nothing approaching the seriousness of the crimes for which he now stands for sentence. However, it should be noted that at the time of the home invasion offence he was on bail in respect of two drug offences. At the time of the manslaughter he was on bail for a drug offence and driving offences, and was on two good behaviour bonds, one of them in association with a suspended control order, for two further drug offences.  
     
      
    15 He travelled to Lebanon early in June 2003, returning to Sydney late in October of that year. All the offences on his criminal history were committed before he left for Lebanon, but some of them were not dealt with until after his return. He was arrested for the home invasion matter on 4 February 2005, and he has remained in custody since then. He was charged with the murder of Matthew Hughan on 18 January 2006. In April 2007 he was sentenced to six months imprisonment for an old offence of assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty. Apart from that period, his time in custody from 4 February 2005 is referable to the matters for which he is to be sentenced. Accordingly, his sentence will date from 4 August 2005. 
     
      
    16 Evidence of his background and personal circumstances is to be found in a psychological report of Ms Jenny Howell and statements of his mother, Ramza Kari and his older sister, Joyce Ajaka. He was born in Sydney, he has three sisters, and he appears to have been raised in a happy and supportive family environment. He left school part way through year 12. He worked in several jobs thereafter, one of them being in a computer technology business conducted by his brother-in-law. However, he was unemployed in May 2003, when the manslaughter was committed.  
     
      
    17 He used marijuana for several years, starting when he was eighteen or nineteen years old, but stopped using the drug in 2004. His criminal history is consistent with a period of drug abuse, but it does not appear to be a factor in the offences with which I am concerned. During 1999 and 2000, his mother had serious health problems and he provided her with considerable assistance. In her statement, Mrs Kari said that she felt this had placed a great deal of pressure on him and may have led to his criminal offending. He began to spend less time at home, and she noticed a general deterioration in his behaviour. His sister described similar observations in her statement, and she also said that she became concerned about the people with whom he was associating. 
     
      
    18 Both Mrs Kari and Mrs Ajaka have maintained contact with him during the lengthy period he has been in custody, and both described him as having matured considerably during that period. He displayed insight into the course his life had been taking through his criminal behaviour. He has undertaken some training in practical skills while in custody. He retains the family’s support, and is assured of employment with his brother-in-law upon his release. 
     
      
    19 I am satisfied that he is remorseful about the killing of Matthew Hughan. The day after the incident an associate of his observed him to be pale, shocked and monosyllabic. That associate later described his appearance to police in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        … George felt, when you see George, when you see his face, … you could tell the guy just seen the devil or something. Like, to shoot a man and die in front of you, that’s nothing easy, you know what I mean. … like every time we spoke about it after that he always felt very sad about it. 
        
       
       
      More recently, he has expressed his remorse to his mother and to the psychologist, Ms Howell, recognising the seriousness of his crime and its effect upon the victim’s family.  
       
      
    20 Ms Howell assessed him as having “a low risk for future violent behaviour”. In her report, she concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        Clinically, Mr Kari demonstrates a number of strengths including his demonstrated insight into the effects of his behaviour, no history of impulsivity, responsive attitude to intervention programmes, and strong positive family support. Mr Kari appears to have matured during his time in custody and developed a number of pro-social strategies to address strong emotion. He has ceased his illicit substance use and engaged in a fitness programme to develop and maintain a positive mental attitude and to increase his physical fitness. 
        
       
       
      H 
       
      
    21 The juvenile offender was born on 23 July 1986. He was only sixteen years old at the time of the robbery in company and the manslaughter, and he is now twenty-two. He has an alarming criminal history for one so young. It comprises a number of offences, some of them very serious, committed between 2001 and 2004. In early 2002 a Children’s Court magistrate placed him on probation for two years for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, and he was subject to that order at the time of the offences for which I am to sentence him. 
     
      
    22 There is no need to recite the other entries in his criminal history. It is sufficient to say that they include offences of aggravated robbery and robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon, together with related offences, for which he was sentenced to substantial prison terms. In respect of two of those sentences non-parole periods were set, but they have now expired and he is serving the balance of those terms, which expire on 23 March 2010. I shall consider the commencement date of his sentence later in these reasons. 
     
      
    23 He travelled to Lebanon in mid-May 2003, returning a little over 3 months later. His trip was financed partly from the proceeds of one of the robberies for which he was subsequently sentenced. Generally, the sentences to which I have referred were imposed for offences committed in 2003. While in custody, he was charged with the murder on 24 February 2005 and the robbery in company on 18 July 2007. 
     
      
    24 In his case I have the benefit of a report from the Department of Juvenile Justice and a psychological assessment by Professor Stephen Woods. The offender also gave evidence. He is a member of a large family and his upbringing appears to have been stable and supportive. It seems that neither of his parents nor any of his siblings have been in conflict with the law, and to Professor Woods he described himself as “the odd one”. 
     
      
    25 It is, indeed, difficult to understand why his life took the course it did in his early years. His schooling was troubled and marred by disruptive behaviour. It seems that he needed the approval of older boys, whose influence on him was anything but beneficial. His education was interrupted in his mid-teens by his being in custody, and it is not clear what level of schooling he reached. Perhaps not surprisingly, his relationship with his parents was poor, and to Professor Woods he acknowledged that this was the result of his own behaviour. He was introduced to alcohol and marijuana at the age of ten, and through his teenage years his intake of alcohol and use of a variety of drugs escalated. However, in his case also it does not appear that drug abuse had a direct bearing upon the offences with which I am dealing. 
     
      
    26 After his extended period of custody, he presents now as a very different young man. He has repaired his relationship with his parents, and he has their support and the support of his siblings and his extended family. He has undertaken a variety of training courses, and has completed a six month period of counselling to address his offending behaviour. He has enrolled in a violence prevention programme, which will be available to him after he has been sentenced. He will be able to live with his parents upon his release, and is assured of employment in his uncle’s home improvement business. It is clear that he, like Kari, has matured markedly in recent years. He displays insight into the futility of his earlier criminal lifestyle, and in evidence he expressed what I consider to be genuine remorse for his involvement in the death of Matthew Hughan. 
     
      
       
      Hamid 
       
      
    27 Jamal Hamid was born on 1 November 1983, and was nineteen years old at the time of the offences with which I am dealing. He is now twenty-four. He has one prior conviction for a minor offence of a regulatory nature, which is of no consequence. He is entitled to be treated on the basis that he has no criminal history. He travelled to Lebanon with his grandparents in the middle of May 2003 and did not return to Sydney until early June 2004. The lengthy stay in Lebanon was due partly to the fact that he was required to do some army service while he was there. He was arrested for the murder on 14 January 2005 and has remained in custody since. He was charged with the home invasion offence at the end of that month. 
     
      
    28 He gave evidence, and I also have a psychological assessment of him by Dr John Jacmon and a statement by his brother-in-law, Mr Caleb Strik. He is one of four children, and he also appears to have had a stable upbringing. Nevertheless, in his early years of secondary school he was expelled because of marijuana use. He later undertook an apprenticeship with his brother, who was a licensed plumber. Unfortunately, his brother’s business failed for personal reasons, an event which affected the whole family. The offender was distressed at the loss of an opportunity to complete the apprenticeship and to pursue his chosen trade. 
     
      
    29 He sought relief in the use of marijuana and cocaine, and began to keep undesirable company. On more than one occasion in his later teenage years, his parents tried to deal with his problem by having him spend time in the village in Lebanon from which they had come. Notwithstanding their efforts, over the period of about six months between December 2002 and May 2003 he was involved in the offences for which he must now face sentence. In his case also, drug abuse provided the background to his criminal behaviour but does not appear to be directly related to it. The origin of his offences, as best I can assess the evidence, is to be found in poor judgment, in the criminal associations which he had formed and, no doubt, the misguided loyalty which they had engendered. 
     
      
    30 It is clear that he also has matured over the period of almost four years that he has been in custody. He has insight into the deleterious effects of an unfortunate period in his life and he is determined to turn his back on it. He expressed remorse for his involvement in the death of Matthew Hughan to his brother-in-law and to Dr Jacmon, and he repeated it in his unchallenged evidence before me. Upon his release he plans to move to Melbourne, where his sister and brother-in-law live and where his brother-in-law, who has a painting business, can offer him employment. 
     
      
       
      Sentencing 
       
      
    31 None of this is to deny the seriousness of these three offenders’ crimes. As a result of the events of 8 May 2003, a young life has been taken. Matthew Hughan met his death because of an impulsive act, but an act done in the course of a criminal enterprise in which, clearly, significant violence was contemplated. In the case of Kari and the juvenile offender, their crime of manslaughter is aggravated by the fact that it was committed in company, at the home of the victim, while each of them was subject to conditional liberty of one form or another. Moreover, in sentencing each of them for that crime, I must take into account on a Form 1 an offence which is itself serious. 
     
      
    32 Hamid’s culpability in relation to the death of Matthew Hughan, of course, is significantly less than that of his co-offenders. Nevertheless, his offence is a serious one of its kind. This is not the more common case in which the accessory’s motive is to prevent a family member or a loved one from being brought to justice. When sentencing him for that offence, I must again take into account on a Form 1 a further offence which is itself serious. He is also to be sentenced for the home invasion offence which, as I have said, is of considerable gravity. 
     
      
    33 The offenders’ youth is an important factor. Particularly is this so of the juvenile offender, but Kari and Hamid were barely adults at the relevant time. In determining the appropriate sentence for each of them, the need to foster their rehabilitation looms large. As I have said, I am satisfied that each of them is remorseful for his part in the death of Matthew Hughan and has developed insight into the futility of his criminal offending generally. I think their prospects of rehabilitation are good. Nevertheless, they would all benefit from a period at liberty under supervision and the sanction of parole. In each case there are special circumstances justifying a departure from the statutory ratio between sentence and non-parole period.  
     
      
    34 That said, their crimes are serious and due regard must still be had to considerations of retribution and deterrence. I do not see the juvenile offender’s objective culpability for the manslaughter to be different from that of Kari, and senior counsel representing him did not suggest that it was. Nevertheless, there is a significant difference between their ages, such as to call for a greater measure of leniency for the juvenile offender. In so saying, I am mindful that his criminal history is more serious than Kari’s. However, he is still serving sentences for two of those previous offences, which were committed during much the same period as those with which I am concerned, and the principle of totality also calls for some moderation of the sentence which I pass.  
     
      
    35 There has been considerable delay in these matters coming to finality. It is not necessary to examine the course of the proceedings in any detail. I was informed from the bar table that the investigation of the killing of Matthew Hughan was complex and, as I have recounted, the three offenders were charged with his murder between 2005 and 2006. On the material before me, it does not appear that their trips to Lebanon contributed in any significant way to this delay. It is also unnecessary to recite the procedural history of the matter before me. It is sufficient to say that a joint trial scheduled for October last year ran aground because of developments over which the offenders had no control.  
     
      
    36 Discussions between their legal representatives and the Crown prosecutor led to their pleas of guilty, which were entered at different times around the middle of this year. I understand that offers by the Crown to accept a plea of guilty to a lesser charge in relation to the killing of Matthew Hughan were accepted reasonably promptly and, no doubt, the offence to which each offender pleaded guilty was seen as a fair reflection of his criminality as it was disclosed by the available evidence. It is also desirable, and to the credit of all concerned, that other charges outstanding against each of them have been able to be dealt with in the same proceedings. These could not be described as early pleas of guilty, but they are of significant utilitarian value and, in my view, should earn a discount of sentence of the order of 15 per cent.  
     
      
       
      Kari 
      
    37 In Kari’s case, the sentence which I would have imposed if he had been found guilty of manslaughter after a trial, taking into account the Form 1 matter, is imprisonment for 8 years. A 15 per cent discount leads to a sentence, in round figures, of 7 years. I would fix a non-parole period of 4½ years. 
     
      
    38 Georgeus Kari, for the offence of manslaughter and taking into account the matter on the Form 1, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 4½ years, commencing on 4 August 2005 and expiring on 3 February 2010, and a balance of term of 2½ years, commencing on 4 February 2010 and expiring on 3 August 2012. 
     
      
       
      H 
       
      
    39 As I have said, the juvenile offender should be dealt with more leniently than Kari because of his very young age and because the principle of totality requires me to be mindful that I am sentencing him at a time when he has been serving significant terms for other offences committed within the same broad time frame. The latest non-parole period for those offences expired on 23 December 2007. While he has since been serving the balance of terms of those sentences, it is fair to consider the period of custody since that date as referable to the current offences because, but for them, he might have been granted parole at that time. After careful reflection, I have decided that totality should be reflected in the length of the sentence which I pass rather than its commencement date. The sentence will be imprisonment for 6 years, with a non-parole period of 3½ years, commencing on 24 December 2007. 
     
      
    40 Accordingly, for the offence of manslaughter and taking into account the matter on the Form 1, the juvenile offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 3½ years, commencing on 24 December 2007 and expiring on 23 June 2011, and a balance of term of 2½ years, commencing on 24 June 2011 and expiring on 23 December 2013. 
     
      
       
      Hamid 
       
      
    41 The charge of accessory after the fact to manslaughter, to which Hamid pleaded guilty, is rarely encountered. Accessory after the fact to murder is more frequent. It is usually dealt with by moderate custodial sentences. Non-custodial sentences are by no means unheard of, but tend to be confined to cases in which the accessory has strong emotional ties to the principal offender. As I have said, this is not a case of that kind. A full-time custodial sentence is called for.  
     
      
    42 The sentencing of Hamid is somewhat constrained by the fact that he has spent the best part of 3 years and 9 months in pre-sentence custody. Senior counsel representing him submitted that he should have the opportunity for release on parole in the immediate future, and the Crown prosecutor, quite properly, put no argument to the contrary. I shall impose a fixed term of imprisonment for 18 months for the offence of accessory after the fact to manslaughter, taking into account the Form 1 matter. That term recognises the plea of guilty, but I find it unnecessary to quantify the reduction of sentence which it earned.  
     
      
    43 For the home invasion offence, but for the plea of guilty, I would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 5½ years. A 15 per cent reduction produces a term, in round figures, of 4½ years. I shall fix a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months for that offence, and that sentence will be accumulated upon the sentence for the other offence. The overall sentence, then, will be imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months. 
     
      
    44 Jamal Hamid, for the offence of accessory after the fact to manslaughter and taking into account the matter on the Form 1, you are sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months, commencing on 14 January 2005 and expiring on 13 July 2006. I decline to specify a non-parole period for that sentence because of the sentence which I am about to pass. For the offence of entering a dwelling house in company with intent to steal, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years and 3 months, commencing on 14 July 2006 and expiring on 13 October 2008, and a balance of term of 2 years and 3 months, commencing on 14 October 2008 and expiring on 13 January 2011. 
     
      
    45 I am indebted to the Crown prosecutor for his comprehensive written submissions, which included reference to authority on relevant sentencing principles. I also appreciate his supplying information about a series of manslaughter sentencing cases, while acknowledging that they turned upon their own facts and could never be more than of limited guidance in the exercise of my discretion. I must also express my appreciation of the submissions of counsel for the three offenders in what I have found to be a most difficult sentencing exercise.

      Offence and sentence: 
       
      The applicant pleaded guilty before the Local Court on 23 February 2004 to an offence contrary to s 11.5(1) of the Criminal Code/Section 233B of the  
      Customs Act 
       1901 that between 15 December 2001 and 26 April 2003 he did conspire with others to commit an offence against s 233B(1)(b) of the  
      Customs Act 
       1901, namely the importation of prohibited imports, being a quantity of MDMA (commonly known as ‘ecstasy’) being not less than the commercial quantity applicable to MDMA. The maximum sentence for the offence was life imprisonment and/or a fine of $750,000.  
       
      
    4 The applicant maintained his plea of guilty in the District Court and on 10 December 2004 was sentenced by Solomon DCJ. The sentence imposed was imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years to date from 16 April 2003 and to expire on 15 April 2010 with a balance of term of 4 years to expire on 15 April 2014. 
     
      
    5 The gross weight of the powder which contained the MDMA was 170.927 kilograms. The net weight of pure MDMA after analysis was 136.913 kilograms. For the purposes of the offence, the commercial quantity of MDMA at the time was .5 kilograms. 
     
      
    6 The applicant appeals from the severity of the sentence. 
     
      
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    7 The facts in this matter are lengthy and complex. The sentencing judge had before him a lengthy summary of facts, a statement of the applicant and the applicant gave evidence. It is not appropriate, nor would it be useful, to repeat that material. What I propose to do is to provide a general background to the offence, keeping in mind that one of the grounds of appeal is that his Honour wrongly characterised the part played by the applicant in the conspiracy.  
     
      
    8 The applicant was one of six persons who were convicted for their part in the importation into Australia of the 170 kgs of MDMA. It arrived concealed in freezer units in a container from Malaysia in April 2003. The other participants were WKC, Dario MILICIC, Andrew Phillip RIDDELL, Mathew WALSH, CAS, and Jamie Matthew WHATLEY. The Crown alleged that the applicant was a middleman or intermediary who facilitated contact between the various members of the conspiracy in Sydney. On the Crown case, the applicant was below WKC and Riddell in the hierarchy of the group, but above CAS who had at the time of the applicant’s sentence hearing already been sentenced by Solomon DCJ. 
     
      
    9 Of those involved in the conspiracy, only Riddell went to trial. The others pleaded guilty and WKC, the applicant and CAS gave statements to the police and gave evidence on behalf of the prosecution in the proceedings against Riddell. Each of them received substantial discounts for their assistance when they were sentenced. There were other participants in the conspiracy from overseas such as Johannes Francois, but they were not dealt with in Australia. 
     
      
    10 The applicant met Riddell in 2001. Riddell became the majority shareholder in a company, Loop Domain, with the applicant and two other men as shareholders. In late 2001, Riddell flew to Europe to meet WKC to make initial arrangements for a drug importation into Australia. In early 2002 Riddell flew to Malaysia to meet with WKC and Johannes Francois. 
     
      
    11 In March and April 2002 Walsh discussed overseas travel with Milicic and Whatley. On 5 April Walsh met with Milicic. Milicic contacted the applicant who knew him and the applicant arranged meetings with Walsh. On 21 April 2002 Walsh and Whatley flew to Germany for meetings related to a drug importation. On 24 April Walsh met with Francois in Belgium and was observed by Belgian police. This importation was later abandoned because of fears of police surveillance. 
     
      
    12 The applicant told police that Riddell had told him in May 2002 of the trip by friends of Milicic to Europe to meet a friend of Riddell’s to whom they had spoken about importing ecstasy. Riddell asked the applicant if he would be an intermediary between Riddell and Milicic and his friends. The applicant agreed and confirmed with Milicic that he had discussed an importation of ecstasy pills with Riddell. The plan was to use Walsh and a company called Muma International for the importation. 
     
      
    13 In June 2002 Riddell told the applicant that he was returning overseas to see his mates and asked the applicant to arrange a meeting with Milicic and Walsh to see if they were still interested in “the pills” and what legitimate items they wanted to import. He also asked the applicant to clarify Customs procedures with them. 
     
      
    14 On 5 June 2002 Walsh, Milicic an the applicant met in Surry Hills, walked to Prince Alfred Park and discussed the importation of drugs and Customs procedures. Walsh said he would talk to Whatley, who was a freight forwarder, about such matters. 
     
      
    15 On 7 June 2002 Milicic, Walsh and the applicant again met in Surry Hills and were overheard discussing shipping containers and the placement of boxes in them and how to avoid quarantine scrutiny. Riddell met briefly with them during the meeting.  
     
      
    16 The applicant continued to provide a means of communication between Milicic and Riddell. Riddell travelled to Hong Kong on 17 June 2002. The applicant advised Milicic when Riddell returned. Later Riddell told the applicant to let “the guys” know that WKC was coming to Australia to discuss “the other thing” with them. The applicant kept Milicic updated about these matters. 
     
      
    17 On 24 July the applicant confirmed that WKC was due in Australia and that Milicic was still interested in going ahead with the importation. WKC arrived in Australia on 16 August 2002. The applicant kept Milicic informed about meeting arrangements. On 18 August 2002 the applicant and Riddell met with WKC at a Kings Cross nightclub. Riddell then left and the applicant introduced WKC to Whatley, who had come to Kings Cross with Milicic. WKC discussed Customs matters with Whatley in the applicant’s presence. Milicic did not enter the nightclub. The applicant later told Riddell that the meeting had gone well but that another meeting was necessary. 
     
      
    18 On 19 August 2002, after a series of calls between Riddell and the applicant, Milicic, Walsh and Whatley, the applicant and WKC travelled to the Orient Hotel at The Rocks and met with Whatley. WKC left Australia later that day. 
     
      
    19 Between 25 September and 5 October 2002 the applicant continued to act as intermediary by providing information to Walsh and Milicic. On 1 October the applicant told Milicic to stop repeatedly contacting him on the telephone. WKC returned to Australia on 5 October 2002 and arranged a meeting with Whatley about narcotics being sent in a container. WKC left Australia on 8 October. 
     
      
    20 In October/November 2002 Walsh and Milicic realised that they were the subject of surveillance and located police listening devices in their vehicles. At the end of October, Whatley agreed to assist to police. In early November the applicant and Riddell discussed contact with Whatley about his meetings with WKC. Riddell told the applicant that Whatley would have a list of computer buyers. During November, Whatley met with the applicant on a number of occasions at Walsh’s instigation. At these meetings the applicant asked Whatley about Customs procedures. The applicant told Whatley that he and Riddell were sick of the delays and that Riddell or he would be going overseas to “see the Chinaman and sort it out”. They made arrangements for Whatley to provide a list of legitimate computer supply companies, contact with which might support a story that the importation was a legitimate business venture. 
     
      
    21 On 22 November Whatley again met with the applicant and they discussed a “dry run” and Customs procedures. The applicant told Riddell of the meeting. Riddell flew to Hong Kong on 22 November and met with Francois and WKC. He returned to Australia on 24 November.  
     
      
    22 In early December 2002 Riddell asked the applicant to chase up the information from Whatley about computer suppliers. On 4 December the applicant met with Whatley at a meeting organised by Walsh and Milicic and they discussed these matters. On 8 December WKC returned to Australia. Riddell had told the applicant to tell the “guys” of WKC’s arrival and arrange a meeting with Whatley. Riddell and the applicant met with WKC at Kings Cross. That evening WKC and the applicant met with Whatley at a Woollahra hotel where WKC and Whatley discussed in the applicant’s presence how computers would be used in the importation and that there would be a “dry run” and that in the second shipment there would be the “10-50” boxes containing the “real goods”. WKC left Australia on 12 December. 
     
      
    23 In January 2003 WKC contacted Riddell and followed up on developments. Riddell asked the applicant to find out if “the guys” received quotes from WKC and warned the applicant not to talk over the telephone. The applicant followed up these matters with Milicic. At around this time Walsh sought to replace Whatley with CAS as the person who would clear the cargo through Customs. 
     
      
    24 On 12 February 2003 Milicic and the applicant met with CAS at Fox Studios. The applicant told CAS that he was interested in bringing in illegal goods inside legitimate shipments. On 13 February the applicant told Riddell that he had met with Whatley’s replacement, who was available to meet with WKC, who had returned to Australia the same day. On 16 February Milicic told the applicant that he had been unable to arrange for CAS to meet with WKC. 
     
      
    25 On 17 February WKC met briefly with the applicant and Riddell, after which the applicant contacted Milicic. That night WKC met with the applicant and CAS at the Golden Century Restaurant at Fox Studios. During the meeting, the applicant telephoned Riddell, asked if he was coming and told him that there was no need for him to come. The three men discussed Customs procedures. 
     
      
    26 On 21, 24 and 27 February WKC and the applicant sought unsuccessfully to meet with CAS. The applicant asked that Milicic obtain mobile telephones for “the Chinaman”. On 28 February the applicant and Milicic had a coded conversation about the matter proceeding. 
     
      
    27 On 2 March 2003 WKC and the applicant met with CAS at a bar at Fox Studios. They discussed the procedure that would be adopted with the applicant asking about the suspicion of Customs and about x-ray machines. 
     
      
    28 On 4 March 2003 WKC met with CAS at his customs broker office and posed as a client at this first meeting. At the same time, Milicic met with the applicant. After meeting with CAS, WKC met with Riddell and the applicant at Surry Hills. WKC told the applicant to keep the mobile phone and give one to CAS so that the importation could be discussed between them. 
     
      
    29 Between 11 and 14 March the applicant met with CAS and provided him with a “covert” mobile telephone. On 26 March the applicant telephoned WKC in Malaysia and had a coded conversation about the importation. On 26 March the applicant contacted WKC in Malaysia and they had a coded conversation about the arrival of “the other things”. On 7 April 2003, the applicant again contacted WKC and inquired about when “it” would arrive. WKC said he would arrive on Friday and they agreed to talk then. 
     
      
    30 On 9 April 2003 Milicic was arrested in relation to another importation. The applicant said that he told Riddell that as a result he did not want anything more to do with the importation. 
     
      
    31 On 11 April WKC returned to Australia. During April Police became aware that a consignment of 36 freezers in containers had been dispatched from Malaysia and intercepted it on arrival in Australia, finding the MDMA secreted in three freezers. On 14 April WKC met with Riddell and the applicant and Riddell asked the applicant to tell WKC what had happened to Milicic. WKC asked the applicant to set up a meeting with CAS and the applicant agreed to do so, although he told WKC that he wished to have no more to do with the matter. On 16 April WKC met again with Riddell and the applicant and later attempted unsuccessfully to meet with CAS. When CAS did not arrive WKC contacted the applicant and told him he would meet with CAS the next day. During the calls which constituted this contact the applicant told WKC not to use any telephone other than the “covert” one to contact him. 
     
      
    32 On 17 April 2003 WKC went to CAS’s office and then met with the applicant at Surry Hills. On 23 April CAS obtained Customs clearance for the container which was delivered to his company. He advised WKC that the container was intact. On 24 April WKC was arrested as he made his way to the airport. The applicant and others were arrested on 26 April 2003. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    33 His Honour reviewed the facts and noted that on 13 February 2004 the applicant made admissions regarding his participation in the conspiracy and that on 26 February he signed a 41 page statement dealing with his involvement. His Honour found that the applicant had participated in the venture from the time of the initial contact by Riddell until his arrest. 
     
      
    34 His Honour referred to the applicant’s statement and to the fact that the applicant described himself as a go-between. In that statement the applicant said that at no time was he told that he would be paid for his participation in the venture but he understood that he could obtain a considerable financial benefit by Riddell and WKC investing in the company, Loop Domain, of which he was a director and shareholder. The applicant also believed that Riddell and WKC would provide other business opportunities for the company. 
     
      
    35 In his evidence the applicant asserted that he believed that he was involved in the importation of a few thousand pills only. His Honour did not accept that evidence. His Honour found that the applicant knew that a substantial quantity of MDMA was to be imported into Australia.  
     
      
    36 His Honour based that finding on four considerations: 
     
      
       
      (1) The applicant was aware of the substantial planning surrounding the importation. 
       
       
      (2) He was aware of the substantial amount of money provided for the purpose of the importation.  
       
       
      (3) He was aware of the approximate size of the freezers, which were to house the importation. 
       
       
      (4) He had expectations that his company was to receive a substantial financial benefit from the importation. 
       
      
    37 In relation to the role of the applicant, his Honour made the following findings: 
     
      
       
      (1) That he played a mid-range role within the criminal syndicate in that he attended meetings with WKC, who was a principal in the scheme and with junior members of the scheme. 
       
       
      (2) He was trusted by Riddell, a principal in the scheme, to arrange meetings between syndicate members and to attend meetings with WKC, Whatley and CAS, which Riddell did not attend, and where detailed planning of the importation and its Customs clearance took place. The applicant reported back to Riddell regarding those meetings. 
       
       
      (3) The applicant became involved in the conspiracy because he believed that he would obtain a substantial financial benefit through Riddell and WKC investing in Loop Domain and by Riddell and WKC providing additional business opportunities for that company. 
       
      
    38 His Honour had regard to the objective seriousness of the offence by reference to the maximum penalty. His Honour noted that MDMA had been characterised by the courts as a midrange drug which had the capacity to cause death or physical and/or psychological injury to those who used it. His Honour commented that the community would not tolerate the importation into Australia of commercial quantities of ecstasy. 
     
      
    39 His Honour had previously sentenced CAS, who pleaded guilty to aiding and abetting the commission of an offence against s 233(b)(1) of the Customs Act. His Honour had sentenced CAS to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 3 years. Because CAS and the applicant were both involved in the importation, his Honour took into account the principle of parity when sentencing the applicant. 
     
      
    40 His Honour distinguished the part played by CAS in the conspiracy from that of the applicant. His Honour found that CAS had played a junior role in the syndicate. CAS had joined the syndicate in about February 2003 and his sole function was to advise the syndicate on Customs procedures and to arrange for Customs clearance of the consignment of MDMA. 
     
      
    41 By way of contrast, the applicant had participated in the syndicate from at least May 2002 and had a significant role in communications between WKC and Riddell on the one hand, and Milicic, Whatley and CAS on the other. The applicant had attended meetings with WKC and Riddell and had arranged meetings on behalf of Riddell where Riddell did not attend but where the applicant had reported back to him. 
     
      
    42 As a further point of contrast, his Honour found that CAS’s involvement in the enterprise was to some extent precipitated by threats made to him by other members of the syndicate whereas his Honour found that the applicant had joined the syndicate purely of his own volition. When sentencing CAS his Honour had been unable to find that his participation in the importation was based on an expectation of financial gain whereas his Honour found that the applicant was motivated by the prospects of substantial financial gain. Finally, his Honour found that CAS was a man of good character whereas his Honour declined to make such a finding in favour of the applicant. 
     
      
    43 The reason his Honour declined to make a finding of good character in favour of the applicant was because he concluded that the applicant had given false evidence in the sentencing proceedings. In his evidence the applicant had said that he was not a user of illegal drugs. Other material before the court made it clear that the applicant had done so while participating in the conspiracy. While his Honour did not take that matter into account when sentencing the applicant, he noted that the effect of the applicant lying under oath was that his credibility was diminished. 
     
      
    44 His Honour acknowledged that the applicant had a strong subjective case. He found that the applicant’s criminal behaviour was atypical of him. The applicant was well educated and had gained a Bachelor of Commerce degree. He was undertaking a Masters Degree in Business Administration at the University of New England at the time of his arrest. From the age of nine until the date of his arrest the applicant had a good employment history. His Honour was satisfied that the business of Loop Domain was a genuine business and that it was not created by the applicant and Riddell as a means of conducting illegal operations. 
     
      
    45 His Honour had before him a report of Dr Westmore, psychiatrist. This report revealed that the applicant had a troubled family history and that the applicant’s family background was significantly dysfunctional. He noted Dr Westmore’s diagnosis that the applicant was suffering from a mood disturbance and required ongoing psychiatric treatment. 
     
      
    46 His Honour found that the applicant was making good progress towards rehabilitating himself. In that regard the applicant had strong support from his family and friends and his Honour thought that his rehabilitation would be enhanced by that support after his release from prison. 
     
      
    47 In relation to the applicant’s plea of guilty his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I also take into consideration the fact that the offender pleaded guilty at an early stage. The plea of guilty demonstrates contrition on the part of the offender. Insofar as contrition is concerned I have heard evidence from the offender he read his letter to me dated 17 June 2004, exhibit 3. I am satisfied that he is truly contrite. A plea of guilty also has a utilitarian benefit to the community and indicates to me that the offender has a desire to facilitate the course of justice.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour did not specify whether, or to what extent, the applicant was entitled to a discount for his plea of guilty. 
       
      
    48 Immediately following his Honour’s observations concerning the applicant’s plea of guilty, his Honour dealt with the applicant’s assistance to authorities which he characterised as “assistance of a high order”. There was before the court the evidence of a Federal police officer and a letter from the manager of the Sydney office of the AFP which set out the extent of the assistance provided by the applicant. In fact the applicant gave evidence for the prosecution in committal proceedings against Riddell. The applicant indicated his willingness to give evidence against his co-offenders in future proceedings. 
     
      
    49 As a result of the applicant’s past assistance, his Honour reduced the head sentence he would otherwise have imposed by 25 percent. Because of the applicant’s promise of assistance in the future, his Honour reduced the head sentence which he otherwise would have imposed by a further 25 percent. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      Ground 1 – The learned trial judge erred in apparently failing to give the applicant the benefit of a discount on sentence by reason of his plea of guilty to the charge of conspiring to import a commercial quantity of the prohibited drug MDMA (known as “ecstasy”). 
       
       
      Or alternatively, 
       
       
      Ground 2 – If there was a discount for the plea of guilty incorporated into the discount given for past and future assistance, then the starting point for the sentence before applying the discount was in all the circumstances too high. 
       
      
    50 The applicant submitted that because his Honour had failed to identify a particular discount for the applicant’s plea of guilty, one of two things had happened. Either his Honour had allowed no discount for the plea or if his Honour had allowed a discount, the start point for the head sentence must have been too high. 
     
      
    51 The applicant’s argument was developed in this way. If his Honour allowed a discount for the plea of guilty of ten percent, the start point for the head sentence would have to have been 28 years. Given the nature of the applicant’s involvement in the importation this was too high a start point. 
     
      
    52 The alternative was that no discount had been allowed by his Honour. The applicant submitted that it could not be said that a discount for the plea had been included in the 50% discount allowed for assistance because of the way in which his Honour had expressed that discount. His Honour had specifically given percentages for both past and future assistance. 
     
      
    53 This criticism has considerable force. Quite clearly a start point of 28 years is excessive given the findings by his Honour as to the role of the applicant in the importation. Alternatively, having specifically referred to the plea of guilty and its utilitarian value, it was incumbent upon his Honour to give some indication as to how he proposed to make use of that finding, ie by including it as part of the overall discount for assistance or by taking it into account in some other way. 
     
      
    54 In the circumstances of this case to simply refer to the plea of guilty with its utilitarian value and as being indicative of contrition without specifying what use was to be made of it, constituted error. The applicant would be left with the strong impression that no value had been placed on his plea of guilty in the sentencing process. This is particularly so when one has regard to s 16A(2)(g) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act which specifies a plea of guilty as a matter which the court must take into account when sentencing. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 – The learned sentencing judge erred in assessing the objective criminality of the applicant’s conduct by: 
       
       
      (a) Concluding that the evidence established that the applicant was aware that a substantial quantity of the prohibited drug MDMA was to be imported into Australia; and 
       
       
      (b) Apparently failing to have regard to the applicant’s withdrawal from participation in the illegal enterprise: See statement of facts at 44.5 and 45.8. 
       
      
    55 The applicant submitted that his Honour had erred in his fact finding in that the evidence did not establish to the necessary standard that the applicant was aware of the quantity of drugs that was to be imported. In his evidence the applicant had specifically denied this, asserting his belief that the importation involved a few thousand pills only. Since this was an important finding of fact which was adverse to the applicant, it needed to be established beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    56 The applicant challenged the four reasons put forward by his Honour for making the finding. The applicant submitted that although there was evidence of substantial planning surrounding the importation, there was no conclusive evidence that the applicant was aware of the approximate size of the freezers and their number. It was submitted that there was no material in the applicant’s statement, or in the recorded conversations, which would enable the court to find to the necessary standard that the applicant was aware of the quantity of drugs being imported. 
     
      
    57 As the factual background makes clear, the applicant had been involved in this project for almost a year. Importantly, he had been Riddell’s representative in all of the meetings with Milicic, Walsh and Whatley. The involvement of Whatley is important because as a freight forwarder he was the person who had the expertise to advise the conspirators concerning customs procedures. This formed the subject matter of many of the meetings. Subsequently Whatley was replaced with CAS, a customs agent, so that CAS could provide the same information. It is not without significance that on 8 December 2002 WKC and Whatley discussed in the applicant’s presence how computers would be used in the importation and that there would be a dry run. They said that in the second shipment there would be “10 – 50” boxes containing the “real goods”. 
     
      
    58 Given the applicant’s extensive involvement, not only with Milicic and his friends but particularly with the customs experts Whatley and CAS, it is fanciful to suggest that the applicant was unaware of the approximate quantity of the drugs to be imported. The reference to “10 – 50” boxes containing the “real goods” in the circumstances of that conversation can only be consistent with a very substantial importation. As his Honour indicated, the extensive planning and the significant amount of money clearly being outlaid to set up the importation could only be consistent with a large importation. It was well open to his Honour to find beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was aware of the quantity of drugs to be imported. 
     
      
    59 In relation to the second limb of this ground of appeal, it was submitted that after 9 April 2003 (being the date when Milicic was arrested) the applicant was doing whatever he could to get out of the enterprise and that he ultimately succeeded in doing so. It was submitted that this withdrawal indicated that the part played by the applicant was not essential to the importation and diminished the objective seriousness of the criminality. It was submitted that the failure of the sentencing judge to make any reference to the applicant’s withdrawal from the enterprise meant that the sentencing judge had failed to give appropriate weight to that factor. 
     
      
    60 In oral submissions senior counsel for the applicant put the proposition somewhat differently. He submitted that the applicant’s withdrawal from the enterprise meant that specific deterrence was not a factor to be taken into account in sentencing the applicant. He submitted that specific deterrence was one of the matters which the sentencing judge had to take into account, pursuant to s 16A of the Commonwealth Crimes Act and that his Honour’s failure to do so was indicative of error. 
     
      
    61 Underlying the submissions is the proposition that the applicant did in fact withdraw from the enterprise as of 9 April 2003. That proposition does not accord with the evidence. It is true that shortly after he became aware of the arrest of Milicic the applicant told Riddell that he did not want anything more to do with the importation. Nevertheless, on 14 April WKC met with Riddell and the applicant upon his return to Australia. WKC asked the applicant to set up a meeting with CAS. The applicant agreed to do so, although he told WKC that he wished to have no more to do with the matter. On 16 April the applicant once again met up with the WKC and Riddell but CAS did not attend. WKC asked the applicant to set up a meeting with CAS the following day. In the course of various telephone conversations with WKC at this time, the applicant told WKC to use only the “covert” phone to contact him. The applicant again met with WKC on 17 April 2003 after WKC had been to CAS’s office.  
     
      
    62 It is clear that the applicant, despite his expressed intention of withdrawing from the enterprise, continued to be active in it between 9 April and 17 April 2003. By 17 April 2003 the container had arrived and there was little more that any of the conspirators could do until the container cleared customs. In those circumstances I am not satisfied that the applicant did withdraw from the enterprise. His participation after 9 April may have been reluctant but it continued. Accordingly, his Honour was entitled to find as he did that the applicant participated in the venture up to the time of his arrest. 
     
      
    63 The Court was referred to such cases as R v Lopez [1999] NSWCCA 245 and R v Burns [2007] NSWCCA 228. Those cases are authority for the proposition that voluntary cessation of what is typically an ongoing criminal activity is a significant factor in mitigation. This is because there is a public policy to be served in encouraging offenders to cease criminal activities. In addition specific deterrence is a factor to be given little or no weight and such a voluntary cessation of criminal activity provides strong evidence of remorse, contrition and rehabilitation. 
     
      
    64 The facts of those cases and the considerations there adverted to are considerably different to the facts of this case. Here there was no real withdrawal from the enterprise. The motivation for the applicant’s expressed intention to withdraw was his fear after the arrest of Milicic that he also would be arrested. This was not consistent with contrition, remorse and rehabilitation nor did it entitle the applicant to have specific deterrence disregarded when his Honour was passing sentence. 
     
      
    65 This ground of appeal has not been made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 – The sentence imposed on the applicant is, when compared with that imposed upon his co-offender known as CAS (a case in which the judgment of this Court is reported at (2005) 160 A Crim R 451; [2005] NSWCCA 192), is such as to leave the applicant with a justifiable sense of grievance that his sentence is manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    66 In raising this ground of appeal the applicant accepted that in R v CAS [2005] NSWCCA 192 this court found that there was due proportion between the sentence imposed on CAS and the applicant. The applicant submitted that this finding by the court should not be regarded as conclusively binding since the material then before the court was likely to have been different and the applicant’s submissions were not available to the court in CAS.  
     
      
    67 The applicant submitted that the principal point of distinction between the applicant and CAS was the fact that the applicant withdrew from the conspiracy before his arrest. It was submitted that the role of CAS was significant in that he had used his specialised skills as a customs agent to clear the goods and to take delivery of the container and that his actions had constituted a substantial breach of trust. It was submitted that when these matters are taken into account, the applicant is entitled to feel a justified sense of grievance at the sentence imposed on him. 
     
      
    68 His Honour carefully considered the respective roles of the applicant and CAS. There is nothing in the submission which invalidates the factors which his Honour took into account in making that comparison. In relation to the additional matters, the asserted withdrawal by the applicant from the enterprise is not made out on the evidence and was not a matter of significance. The question of breach of trust was relevant but went no further than the misuse of his position as a customs agent to facilitate the importation. This had clearly been taken into account by his Honour since it constituted the gravamen of the offence with which CAS had been charged. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    69 His Honour’s treatment of the applicant’s plea of guilty involved error. However, for this court to quash a sentence and impose a lesser one, it is not sufficient for the applicant to establish error. It is necessary that this court be satisfied that “some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed” – subs 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [79] and [99-100]. I am of the opinion that although error has been shown in the manner specified, a lesser sentence is not warranted in law.  
     
      
    70 In reaching that conclusion I adopt the reasoning of Howie J in SZ v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 19 which was approved in R v JRD [2007] NSWCCA 55. There his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “4 There is a limited degree to which an otherwise appropriate sentence can be discounted for one reason or a combination of reasons and yet result in a sentence that duly reflects the objective seriousness of the offence and the purposes of punishment. There was by applying common law principles, and there still is by the application of the provisions of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
        , a bottom line beneath which a sentence cannot legitimately be set. If that bottom line is not respected, the sentence will fail to carry out the purposes of punishment. That bottom line is reflected in relation to a discount for assistance to the authorities by s 23(3) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. 
         It is spelled out there in the Act because it is in relation to the application of discounts for assistance that the often conflicting purposes and policies of sentencing a particular offender come brightly into focus. 
        
       
       
        
        5 But the notion of an irreducible minimum sentence that must inform the lower limit of the sentencing discretion is manifest in the often quoted decisions of this Court emphasising that at the conclusion of the exercise of the sentencing discretion, whatever be the subjective circumstances of the offender and whatever discounts are applied to achieve a recognised public policy, the sentence must bear a reasonable relationship with the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfill the manifold purposes of punishment: see for example  
        R v Geddes 
         (1936) 36 SR (NSW) 554; and  
        R v Dodd 
         (1991) 57 A Crim R 349. Sometimes it is said that the sentence must “accord with the general moral sense of the community”:  
        R v Rushby 
         [1977] 1 NSWLR 594. After taking into account the various statutory and common law principles and applying such discounts that arise on the particular facts, the sentencing judge is required to stand back and ask whether the resulting sentence is just and reasonable, not only to the offender but also to the community at large. 
        
       
       
        
        6 These observations are trite and so there is a risk that they will be overlooked in an attempt to achieve one of the purposes of punishment at the expense of another. I simply wish to emphasise that, because there is only limited room to discount a sentence without going below the bottom line, it must follow that the application of one discount for one purpose will inevitably impact upon the extent to which another discount can be applied to achieve a different purpose. The extent to which a sentence is discounted in recognition of the utilitarian value of the plea must necessarily affect the ability of the court to discount the sentence in recognition of assistance and the consequences of it for the offender. The fact that the overall sentence is discounted in recognition of assistance or for some other reason must affect the ability of the court to reduce the non-parole period in order to reflect special circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        7 Counsel for the applicant argued that a proper application of both the guideline in  
        Thomson and Houlton 
         [2000] NSWCCA 309 as to the effect of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty and the acknowledged range of the discount available for assistance meant that it was legitimate in an appropriate case to discount a sentence by up to 75 percent. It was argued that, as the discount for the plea and the discount for assistance reflect two different policies and did not overlap, because the utilitarian value of the plea had nothing to do with contrition, the court should give them both their full effect. But the argument simply overlooks the fact that it is impossible to see how a sentence that is only 25 percent of what would otherwise be appropriate could not be “unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence”. 
         
         
        8 I accept that what is “unreasonably disproportionate” is not simply determined by the objective facts of the offence and has to take into account matters such as the threat posed to the offender by reason of the assistance given and the nature and extent of the assistance:  
        R v C ( 
        1994) 75 A Crim R 309. But this does not relieve the judge from the primary task of imposing a sentence that reflects the objective circumstances of the offence:  
        R v WHS 
         (NSWCCA, unreported, 27 March 1995). The decision in  
        York v R 
         (2005) 221 ALR 541 does not suggest otherwise. 
        
       
       
        
        9 I will assume for present argument that before  
        Thomson and Houlton  
        the discount for assistance was given in addition to any reduction in the sentence for a plea and could extend up to 50 percent. But in my opinion after that decision, when the discount for the utilitarian value of the plea could be as high as 25 percent, the courts generally had less scope to give a discount for assistance where there had been an early plea of guilty. This is simply because, as I have pointed out, there is a limit to the amount to which a sentence can be discounted and yet not fall beneath the bottom line. Similarly if an  
        Ellis 
         discount is allowed for disclosing unknown criminality in addition to a discount for an early plea, the ability to give any further discount for whatever purpose is reduced. 
        
       
       
        
        10 There is in my opinion nothing unfair about this result nor is the public policy in encouraging assistance necessarily reduced. There is still on offer, even after an early plea, a discount of somewhere in the vicinity of 25 percent, or more in an exceptional case. The simple fact is that it is more important to the administration of justice to encourage and reward early pleas of guilty. If the pursuit of that policy diminishes the ability to encourage and reward assistance, so be it. There is a greater public policy at stake and that is public confidence in the courts to impose sentences that are just and reasonable to all concerned.”

      R v Sukkar  
      [2006] NSWCCA 92; 172 A Crim R 151. 
       
      
    71 I appreciate that part of his Honour’s reasoning is based on s 23(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) (NSW). In that regard, however, the provisions of s 16A(1) and 16A(2)(g) and (h) of the Commonwealth Crimes Act are to similar effect and provide the same support for his Honour’s conclusion. 
     
      
    72 As can be seen from the maximum penalty for this offence, its objective seriousness was substantial. The part played by the applicant was significant as providing the link between the two principals and the link between them and other subordinate members of the conspiracy. The application of discounts should not prevent proper weight being given to these matters. It is important that the final sentence reflect an appropriate balance. 
     
      
    73 On the facts of this case I am not satisfied that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed. The discounts specified by his Honour for the applicant’s assistance were generous. Had his Honour made clear in his remarks that he was taking the applicant’s plea of guilty into account when granting an overall discount of 50 percent, which included the discounts for past and future assistance, there would have been no error.  
     
      
    74 As Howie J made clear and as s 16A(1) expressly stipulates “A court must impose a sentence that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence”. To apply a further discount beyond the 50 percent already allowed by his Honour would breach this fundamental principle and would be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence. 
     
      
    75 The orders which I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
      (2) The appeal be dismissed.

     R v BOLDER, Dean 
      
     R v ZAPHIR, Alexander 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: These are two appeals by the Director of Public Prosecutions pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the inadequacy of sentences imposed on the respondents. The respondents were each tried and convicted of one count of assault with intent to rob whilst in company contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 The respondents were tried jointly and were each sentenced to a non-parole period of 15 months and a balance of term of 9 months with a direction that the sentences be served by way of periodic detention. The respondent Bolder failed to attend as required on 2 and 9 May 2008 and he commenced serving his sentence on 16 May 2008. The respondent Zaphir commenced serving his sentence on 2 May 2008. 
     
      
    3 The appellant submitted that the sentences imposed on both respondents were manifestly inadequate. It is submitted that both the terms of imprisonment are inadequate and that the inadequacy is further compounded by the direction that the sentences be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    4 Mr Ng was at the time of the offence a 63 year old pensioner. On 25 February 2006 he went to a block of home units to visit his sister. He walked up a flight of stairs from the road and saw two men coming down a flight of stairs onto a landing. These persons were the respondents who lived in the same block of home units. Mr Ng said that the two men retreated up the stairs and he continued and visited his sister. He was carrying two bags of vegetables at the time. He also had a wallet in his back pocket which contained $2,000. 
     
      
    5 After about 20 minutes had passed Mr Ng left his sister’s unit and walked towards the stairs. When he reached the top landing he saw Zaphir across the road leaning on the side of a car. Zaphir gave a hand signal to Bolder (who was hiding amongst the nearby otto bins). Bolder jumped out and punched Mr Ng in the nose with a closed fist. Mr Ng described the force of this punch as strong enough to make him unconscious. Bolder was described by his Honour “as a powerfully built, fit man.” Mr Ng gave evidence that his own weight was 63 kilos and his height 160 cms. 
     
      
    6 The evidence indicated that multiple punches were inflicted on the appellant’s face. As Mr Ng was seeking to defend himself by using his hand to fend off the attack by Bolder, Zaphir rushed up and joined the attack. Mr Ng was held from behind so that he could not defend himself. He said that the two men held him upside down and “chuck me down the flights of stairs and I landed on my head and my head was heavily bleeding as a result of that.” 
     
      
    7 Mr Ng ended up lying on the intermediate landing on the stairs from where he was dragged along the landing and down the stairs onto the footpath. He gave evidence that while he was lying on his back on the footpath Bolder was punching and continually kicking him whilst Zaphir put his hands in his pockets and searched him uttering “money, money, money.” 
     
      
    8 Mr Ng managed to keep his hand over the rear pocket of his pants throughout the attack. However, his keys were taken from one of his pockets. The trial judge found that the attack lasted no more than 2 minutes and ended when several neighbours responded to Mr Ng’s cries. 
     
      
    9 The respondents ran off and were arrested shortly afterwards. Bolder declined to be interviewed. Zaphir agreed to an interview in which he said he had seen a fight involving Bolder and that he had come to Bolder’s aid. The jury rejected this account although Zaphir did not give evidence in the trial. Bolder did give evidence in the trial in which he said he had confronted Mr Ng about a stolen bum bag which he claimed Mr Ng had stolen 2 weeks earlier. Bolder said that Mr Ng grabbed his throat, choking him and that he pushed Mr Ng which led to blows being exchanged by both of them. He claimed that Zaphir came to his aid. The jury also rejected Bolder’s account. 
     
      
    10 The medical evidence established that Mr Ng suffered a fractured nose and multiple soft tissue abrasions and bruises to his scalp, forehead, nose, both arms, elbows and both knees. 
     
      
       
      Subjective features of the respondents 
       
      Dean Bolder 
       
      
    11 Bolder was born on 6 August 1964. A pre-sentence report and psychological and psychiatric reports were tendered during the sentence hearing. However, no oral evidence was given. 
     
      
    12 The sentencing judge identified the fact that Bolder’s mother had suffered violence at the hands of his alcoholic father. He was estranged from his father for a time but, his father now being in frail health, he had a closer relationship with him. His mother died in 2006. His Honour found that Bolder takes an active role in caring for his father. 
     
      
    13 Bolder had recently commenced a relationship. Although there was evidence that he had previously been involved in other relationships Ms Robilliard said in her psychological report that Bolder “never entertained close personal attachments.” 
     
      
    14 Bolder left school after completing Year 10. He was able to secure employment in different fields and completed courses at TAFE, including a commercial cookery course. He was in regular employment as a chef until his arrest. 
     
      
    15 There was evidence which his Honour accepted that Bolder had been assaulted to the point of unconsciousness by robbers approximately 8 years before the offence. This led him to having sleeping difficulties. Bolder has been diagnosed with (adult) attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. His personality profile testing results are consistent with a depressive pathology. His Honour observed that he has been reluctant to discuss with psychiatrists his motivation for another offence involving obscene exposure and indecent assault in April 2006. Furthermore, his Honour could not discern any explanation for the offending conduct for which he was being sentenced. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “My sense is that he is well aware of what drove him to offending on both occasions, but for reasons relating perhaps to embarrassment and shame and fear of being labelled he is reluctant to disclose.” 
        
       
      
    16 His Honour doubted whether Bolder had provided full and frank histories to the two psychiatrists and psychologists. 
     
      
    17 The sentencing judge concluded that the respondent was likely to have been a binge drinker. He had used cannabis, heroin, amphetamine, cocaine and ecstasy. However, Bolder was not under the influence of drugs when he committed the present offence. Although Bolder had previous convictions in 1989 relating to cannabis his Honour accepted that he should be assessed as having “basically a clean sheet so far as criminal convictions were concerned.” 
     
      
       
      Alexander Zaphir 
       
      
    18 Zaphir was born on 2 February 1964. Both a pre-sentence report and a psychiatric report were tendered at the sentence hearing. No oral evidence was led.  
     
      
    19 Zaphir’s early family environment presented him with considerable difficulties. His mother was self-obsessed, schizophrenic, neurotic and prone to irrational behaviour. His father was often absent and was emotionally distant. Zaphir was sexually, physically and psychologically abused by his two older brothers. When he disclosed the abuse to his father he was ridiculed. He has since cut off all contact with his family. Zaphir has supportive friends. He has had several long term girlfriends and married once. Zaphir has been assessed as having above average intelligence. He left school in Year 10 and studied hair dressing. By the age of 19 he managed a London salon and has since taken up fashion photography with some success. However, he has not worked consistently and had been working as a volunteer child care worker for a year before his arrest. 
     
      
    20 Zaphir claimed to the Probation and Parole Service that he was suffering from bipolar disorder. Dr Neilssen, a psychiatrist, diagnosed dysthymic disorder (chronic low grade depression) and did not rule out bipolar disorder. Dr Nielssen was of the view that Zaphir’s psychological problems had affected his capacity to work consistently and maintain long term relationships. However, there was nothing to suggest that his condition played any part in the commission of the offence. Dr Nielssen believed that Zaphir carried a higher risk than the average person of developing severe depression if he were incarcerated. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Regrettably that [depression] can be one of the side effects of incarceration. The treatment and care for prisoners is the responsibility of Justice Health, rather than this Court.” 
        
       
      
    21 Zaphir has a history of drug abuse which included heroin at age 29. He has since remained on a methadone program. Although Zaphir has convictions for drink driving in 1982 and obtaining property by deception in 1986 his Honour accepted that the present offence was “entirely out of character.” Zaphir continued to deny his offending conduct to the Probation and Parole Officer who prepared the pre-sentence report. Although his Honour concluded that “few positive outcomes could occur as a consequence of his denial”, Zaphir did not present as a recidivist offender. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    22 The Crown submitted that the manifest inadequacy in the respondents’ sentences is a result of a number of errors. It was submitted that his Honour erred in his application of the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 340. It was further submitted that his Honour erred by taking into account as a mitigating factor the fact that the respondents were on bail pending their trial and that they had been before the court on three other occasions. If not an error to have regard to this matter it was submitted that his Honour gave these factors too much weight. It was further submitted that he erred in subsequently double counting these factors when considering and making a finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    23 The appellant submitted that the sentences which his Honour imposed undervalued the need for personal deterrence and placed undue emphasis on the rehabilitation of the respondents. It was submitted that his Honour erred by not placing any weight on the absence of remorse. 
     
      
    24 Finally, it was submitted that his Honour erred in finding that by reason of their ages the respondents would be isolated in prison which would make their custody more onerous. In the absence of evidence it was submitted that this finding was not open. 
     
      
    25 The appellant emphasised that each respondent was sentenced for a very serious offence where the maximum penalty was twenty years imprisonment.  
     
      
       
      Some findings of the sentencing judge 
       
      
    26 The sentencing judge accepted that “substantial punishment” is required for offenders who commit the type of offence involved in the present matters. His Honour accepted that when sentencing it was necessary to be mindful of the principle that ordinary citizens should be free to walk the streets without fear of physical violence. His Honour found that the assault was persistent and, when it was considered that it was for the purpose of consummating a robbery, was sustained for a greater period than is usually involved in this type of offence. His Honour found that each respondent was actively involved in the attack which made the offence more serious than if one or other had simply been involved by being ready willing and able to support the other. 
     
      
    27 His Honour found that the victim was “specifically targeted.” His Honour said that: 
     
      
       
        
        “[there] was planning to an extent, namely that the ambush was put in place. It is the ambush, though, rather than the level of planning that constitutes an aggravating feature. The use of the feet to strike Ng when he was on the ground constitutes an aggravating feature, the striking with the foot was to the body and not to the head.”  
        
       
      
    28 His Honour did not find that Mr Ng was a vulnerable victim for the purposes of s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
       
      R v Henry 
       
      
    29 Although his Honour considered the guideline judgment in Henry and was mindful of the factors identified by the Chief Justice at [162] which may justify a fulltime sentence of imprisonment of between four and five years, his Honour departed from the indicated sentence. There are significant differences between the attributes of the characteristic offender and offence in Henry and the circumstances of the present respondents. The respondents were not young and were not carrying a weapon such as a knife. Mr Ng was not vulnerable in the sense identified in Henry. The present offences involved a limited degree of planning but significant actual violence rather than merely a threat of violence. Although no money was actually taken this was because the respondents were interrupted by neighbours who responded to Mr Ng’s cries for help. The offender contemplated in Henry had the benefit of a plea of guilty. The present respondents denied their guilt and have shown no evidence of remorse. 
     
      
    30 To my mind the present offences were serious – at least as serious as those contemplated in the Henry guideline judgment. Although there was a clear need for the rehabilitation of the respondents this could not be permitted to displace the need for punishment and personal and general deterrence. Although each of them has some mental health issues and had some difficulties when growing up they had both managed to obtain stable employment and enter stable relationships. Although each had personal difficulties they had displayed a capacity to resolve them. These personal difficulties did not justify an amelioration of their sentences. 
     
      
    31 Although neither respondent was carrying a weapon they acted in company and were both physically involved in assaulting Mr Ng. Mr Ng suffered serious injuries, was clearly distraught and put in terror for his safety. The assault was persistent and the respondents only desisted when they were interrupted. They dragged Mr Ng from the landing and brought him down the stairs and continued to assault him in an endeavour to rob him when he had come to the footpath. He had been walking alone and was unable to successfully defend himself and resist the attack. 
     
      
    32 The sentencing judge said that he had taken into account the features of the present offences and offenders common to the guideline but said of the guideline that it “was written in respect of successfully completed armed robberies. That is to say it was written in respect of one of the more serious offences created by s 97(1).” The Crown submitted that by apparently confining the relevance of the guideline to completed offences his Honour’s starting point for the sentences were impermissibly lenient and at odds with his earlier finding that the “[objective] criminality attaching to these offences is such that it does call for a substantial period of imprisonment.” In my opinion this submission should be accepted. 
     
      
    33 The offences committed by the respondents involved a significant level of violence and together they were responsible for significant injuries to Mr Ng. Their attack subsisted for a period and was only terminated when they were interrupted by neighbours. The offence being committed in company a period of fulltime imprisonment was inevitable unless there were significant countervailing considerations. To my mind those considerations were not present in the personal circumstances of either offender. Their lack of remorse and continued denial of the offences required a sentence which not only provided adequate punishment but provided appropriately for specific deterrence. 
     
      
       
      Delay 
       
      
    34 Both respondents were on bail pending their trial. Rigorous reporting conditions were initially imposed but these were relaxed. By the time of the trial the respondents had each been on bail for approximately two years and had been required to attend court on three occasions. 
     
      
    35 His Honour said of these circumstances: 
     
      
       
        
        “There can be no doubt being on bail, reporting to police, awaiting trial and being on trial are all stressful. That the offenders have been on bail for two years and been to court for the purposes of trial on three prior occasions, are matters that can be taken into account as mitigating features.” 
        
       
      
    36 The delay in the present matter was occasioned by the process of committal followed by problems with the initial trial. The respondents were committed for trial on 13 October 2006 and although their trial commenced on 19 February 2007 the jury had to be discharged. The next trial occurred on 12 June 2007 but was adjourned due to the unavailability of Crown witnesses. The jury could not agree at the trial which commenced on 10 September 2007. The matter was listed for further trial in December but was adjourned until January this year due to the unavailability of defence counsel. 
     
      
    37 I discussed the impact of delay in the sentencing process in R v Hathaway [2005] NSWCCA 368. The principles are well understood and I need not repeat them. In the present case it may be accepted that the uncertainty occasioned to the respondents may have imposed some hardship. However, neither respondent has demonstrated progress towards rehabilitation and it could not be said that their crimes were stale. In these circumstances if, as it would appear may have been the case, his Honour was of the view that the delay had resulted in an unfairness to the respondents this finding was not available: see R v Johnson (unreported, NSWCCA, 16 May 1997, per Priestley JA). 
     
      
    38 The sentencing judge allowed the conditions of the respondents’ bail to influence the sentence which he imposed. His Honour believed that each respondent had initially been required to report to police daily and then subsequently two times weekly. This was not accurate but even if it was these conditions were not sufficiently onerous as to require any significant amelioration of the sentences. Curfews were not imposed and the respondents were not required to participate in any residential programs. 
     
      
    39 In fact Bolder’s original bail conditions were that he was to be of good behaviour and not associate with Zaphir. These conditions were imposed on 25 February 2006 but his bail was revoked on 11 April 2006 when he committed further offences and was taken into custody. He was then released with more restrictive conditions, as a result no doubt of the offences which he had allegedly committed whilst on bail. Although these conditions were more restrictive the fact that they were imposed did not justify amelioration of his sentence. 
     
      
    40 With respect to Zaphir, his bail conditions from the date of his arrest until the date of the verdict did not require reporting. He was merely to be of good behaviour and not associate with Bolder. More significant conditions were imposed following the verdict and before sentence but these would not justify any amelioration of his sentence. 
     
      
       
      Double-counting 
       
      
    41 His Honour had regard to delay and the bail conditions in relation to the penalty which he believed appropriate to be imposed. He had further regard to these matters when finding special circumstances. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is to remember [sic] I noted the offenders were entitled to mitigation on account of the length of the bail period and reporting and tensions relating to incomplete trials. I intend to use that factor as one basis for finding special circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    42 There was an apparent double counting which was plainly inappropriate: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172. 
     
      
       
      Personal deterrence and rehabilitation 
       
      
    43 I have already indicated that there was no evidence of remorse in either respondent. His Honour determined that by reason of the prolonged nature of the proceedings no further element for personal deterrence was required to be incorporated into the sentence. This finding was not open. The respondents gave no indication that they accepted responsibility for their offending and although the proceedings had taken greater than the usual length of time there was nothing to suggest that they had confronted and resolved their inclinations to commit serious crime. Neither respondent gave evidence during the sentence proceedings making it difficult for his Honour to reach positive conclusions in relation to either respondent’s prospect of rehabilitation. In many cases a submission that an offender has seen the error of his or her ways and wishes to start a new life is supported only by a report from the psychologist tendered on the offender’s behalf. When the offender continues to maintain his or her innocence there are difficulties in accepting that although reported by the psychologist the determination to reform is genuine. When it is not supported by evidence from the offender those difficulties are compounded. 
     
      
    44 The obligation for a sentencing court to impose a sentence which recognises the need to provide for an offender’s rehabilitation is undoubted. However, this must not have the consequence that the punishment actually imposed is inadequate to punish for the particular offence or offences and provide appropriately for deterrence. In the present case I accept that a finding of special circumstances was appropriate and that a sufficient period on release under supervision was required. However, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Given that it is the first time in custody for each offender, the rehabilitation of each would be better accomplished in a community setting. Both offenders have demonstrated conduct consistent with their taking their rehabilitation in the community seriously.” 
        
       
      
    45 My understanding of his Honour’s remarks is that it was the identified need for rehabilitation which was the primary motivation for both the length of the sentence and his Honour’s decision that it should be served by periodic detention. In my opinion by approaching the matter in this manner his Honour has allowed these considerations to displace an appropriate appreciation of the seriousness of the offence which required a period of fulltime custody. 
     
      
       
      Age 
       
      
    46 His Honour concluded that the age of each offender was well above the median of the prison population. He concluded that for that reason they may be more isolated in prison than younger men would be. His Honour concluded that would make their custody more arduous. 
     
      
    47 Both respondents were in the early forties when sentenced. There was no evidence before the sentencing judge that gaol is more isolating or arduous for inmates in their forties. This consideration was simply irrelevant. By having regard to it the sentences have been further reduced from those which were appropriate. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    48 The principles in relation to Crown appeals are well known. They were summarised by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42. I need not repeat them. Although a Crown appeal should be rare and confined to establishing matters of principle for the guidance of sentencing courts nevertheless an appellate court may interfere to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing. 
     
      
    49 Notwithstanding the care which this Court must exercise before intervening I am in no doubt that the sentences which his Honour imposed were manifestly inadequate. Apart form the inadequacies of the identified term his Honour provided further and significant leniency by directing that the sentences should be served by periodic detention (R V Douar (2005) 159 A Crim R 154. The Crown submitted during the course of the sentencing proceedings that a fulltime custodial sentence was the only appropriate penalty. I agree. There were no circumstances in relation to either respondent which justified the sentences his Honour imposed. This Court must intervene. 
     
      
    50 The offences committed by the respondents were unprovoked and in attempting to rob Mr Ng they inflicted gratuitous and significant violence. There is no explanation for the offence by either offender and no remorse has been demonstrated. Although the evidence disclosed that each offender has faced difficulties in life there is nothing in their personal circumstances which justified ameliorating the sentences beyond those otherwise appropriate for their offending. Having regard to the various matters to which I have referred I am of the opinion that the following orders should be made: 
     
      
       
      In relation to Mr Bolder 
       
       
      1. Appeal upheld. 
       
      2. Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court. 
       
      3. Sentence the respondent to a period of fulltime imprisonment being a non-parole period of 2½ years commencing on 16 May 2008 and expiring on 15 November 2010 with a balance of term of 2 years commencing on 16 November 2010 and expiring on 15 November 2012. The first date the respondent would be eligible for release to parole is 15 November 2010. 
       
       
      In relation to Zaphir 
       
       
      1. Appeal upheld. 
       
      2. Quash the sentence imposed in the District Court.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Hong Phong Le appears for sentence today in relation to three most serious offences. He pleaded guilty to an offence that between 28 November 2005 and 23 May 2006 he conspired with a number of others to import prohibited imports into Australia, they being narcotic goods consisting of a quantity of heroin not less than the trafficable quantity. He also pleaded guilty to an offence of conspiring, with a number of others, to traffic in both heroin and methylamphetamine, the quantity involved being a commercial quantity. The third offence is an offence of conspiring with others to deal with money to the value of $1,000,000 or more, which he and his co-conspirators intended would become an instrument of crime. In fact, the amount involved was estimated to be more than 4.7 million dollars.2 The offender was born in a refugee camp after his parents left Vietnam. His father had been a soldier in the South Vietnamese army and so after the war it became necessary for the offender’s father and his wife to leave Vietnam. That is why the offender was born in a refugee camp. He also has a younger brother. The family was sponsored by a Canadian family and so they moved to Vancouver Island. There the offender experienced racism. His family was involved in collecting shellfish and the Canadians, so the offender said, had a general attitude of distrust and resentment to Vietnamese who would carry on that past time or occupation.3 The offender moved to Vancouver on the mainland where he began associating with other Vietnamese people. It was in these circumstances that he began to use drugs, namely cocaine. On occasions it was not only a case of using drugs but also supplying when he and his friends would pool their money in order to obtain drugs which they would then share.4 The offender's parents became aware of their son’s drug taking activities and so in order to take him away from his drug taking associates they came to Australia. This was a fateful decision. The offender’s aunt, his mother’s sister, had a boyfriend, Khan Hong Tran, also known by the name Ken or Kenny. The offender’s family were poor but Kenny was very rich, or at least he appeared to be. He drove a flash car and would always pay for the family when they went out. The offender was attracted to the Kenny’s displays of wealth. He had discussed with Kenny the fact that he was a drug user back in Canada and commenced using drugs here as well. Kenny, as it turned out, was a “Mr Big."" One of the activities in which he was involved was the transport and sale of drugs to Melbourne. This required that the drugs were transported down to Melbourne and the offender became aware that one of those who was doing that was a man called Paul Vo. The offender, attracted by the money that was being displayed, and attracted by Kenny’s lifestyle, approached Kenny and asked to become involved in Kenny’s drug business. That was another fateful decision.5 Matters progressed to the stage where the offender became Kenny’s right hand man, or lieutenant, or secretary. I have described Kenny as a “Mr Big”. The offender became a “Mr Big Enough”. 6 The offender worked closely with Kenny, carrying out his instructions and directions concerning money laundering, drug trafficking and drug importing. The core business of Kenny’s syndicate was, as I mentioned, the sale of drugs by members of the syndicate in Sydney to buyers in Melbourne. The drugs would be couriered down to Melbourne by various syndicate members and the money would be remitted back to Sydney as payment for the drugs. This process continued over a lengthy time between 2005 and 2006. Kenny would get the drugs through various means, including importing drugs from overseas and also through purchases from domestic suppliers who had already had drugs available in Sydney. The drugs would be kept in Sydney - the appropriate term is probably warehoused - until couriers were available to transport the drugs to Melbourne. Various drugs were acquired and sold in this manner, including heroin and methylamphetamine. Kenny would arrange, using the offender as the go-between or mule man, for various members within the syndicate to act as couriers to take the drugs to Melbourne. They would either take them on commercial airline flights or in a car. The payment was effected by a number of different methods. On some occasions the purchaser would simply provide the money to a “middle woman” by the name of Ngoc Nguyen. Money would be sent by her, using various money remittance businesses, to similar businesses in Sydney for collection by either Kenny or the offender. On other occasions the money would be given to the couriers who would either use the money remitting businesses or simply bring it back with them in cash.7 The Crown tendered an agreed statement of facts setting out a number of what are called drug incidents involving members of the Kenny syndicate. These were specific examples of incidents observed by the authorities in furtherance of an ongoing agreement to obtain and supply drugs to buyers in Melbourne when and if required. 8 I commence my recitation of these incidents by noting that the syndicate seems to have been well organised and very productive, carrying on the business of importing and then trafficking in drugs as efficiently as if they were dealing in a legitimate product such as apples. It is apparent that the offender and his co-conspirators had no regard whatsoever to the nature of the commodity they were involved in, apart from the fact, of course, that it was highly valuable. The offender, it is clear, paid no regard whatsoever to the awful consequences that drug trafficking brings about, consequences felt by human beings at every level of society. Drug addicts have their lives ruined by heroin and methylamphetamine. Others who do not use drugs face the consequences of drug addicts committing crimes, at times violent, in order to satisfy their addictions. The offender apparently thought nothing of these consequences, thinking only of the benefit to himself that his activities would bring.9 On 28 November 2005 the offender left Sydney intending to go to Germany. Another member of the syndicate by the name of Li, went there from Melbourne. Once there they assisted yet another person to recruit a courier in order to bring drugs from Vietnam to Australia. They found a man by the name of Springer. On 16 December 2005 he arrived at Sydney on a flight from Vietnam in possession of seven balloons of heroin, approximately eighty grams which he had secreted internally. He had left fourteen similar balloons behind. His importation was detected and he was arrested and charged. The offender’s role in this importation included travelling to Germany where he assisted others to recruit Springer, notifying Kenny that he was making arrangements for Springer’s importation, and then attempting to locate Springer in order to confirm that he had been arrested.10 The second incident that the Crown refers to occurred between 13 February 2006 and 10 March 2006. It involved the trafficking of a significant quantity of heroin. Money was subsequently remitted from Melbourne to Sydney as payment for those drugs. They were transported to Melbourne by Tia and Vu on behalf of the syndicate. They supplied the person, who I mentioned before, Ngoc Nguyen, with a kilogram of crystal methylamphetamine and an ounce of heroin, telling other syndicate members that the remainder of the heroin was stolen whilst they were in Melbourne. The offender’s role including arranging for the supply of an ounce of heroin, arranging for the supply of crystal methylamphetamine, arranging for Tia to transport a quantity of drugs from Sydney to Melbourne, providing Tia and Vu with the drugs, contacting the man by the name of Li to confirm that they had lost the drugs, discussing the loss of the drugs with Kenny, Tia and Vu, finding out whether it was still okay to go ahead with an importation because of what happened with the drugs given to Tia and Vu, telling Mr Le that Vu had received a beating from Kenny over the fact that heroin had been stolen, and making other arrangements as well.11 The third incident involved the transport of 800 grams of crystal methylamphetamine from Sydney to Melbourne. Again Tia was the courier, but this time he was arrested and charged after the drugs were intercepted. The offender had no direct role in this incident because he was in Vietnam at the time, but he spoke to Kenny about it before Tia’s arrest at Melbourne airport.12 The fourth incident occurred in March and April 2006, but this time the offender was in Vietnam. He had a number of conversations with Kenny and Li. One of the topics of the conversation was a planned importation to be undertaken by a man by the name of Michael Fisher. It was believed by Kenny and Le that Fisher had arrived in Australia by the 3rd and 4th of April. They therefore attempted to locate him in Melbourne. The offender told Li that Fisher had been stopped by Immigration and had been sent back to Vietnam where the offender was. The offender has since claimed that he simply made up the name of Fisher and that he was attempting at the time to comply with his mission for the Kenny syndicate which was, at that time, to arrange for couriers in Vietnam to take the heroin into Australia. 13 The offender assisted with arrangements for the importation of heroin into Australia on 14 April 2006 by the man by the name of Huy. During this period the offender made many calls with Mr Li concerning the attitude of drug couriers and the size of the packages involved. He made attempts to get smaller items of drugs. He travelled to Vietnam in furtherance of the conspiracy to import drugs; told Kenny when the importation would take place; discussed with him how many couriers there were in Vietnam and how many were coming from Australia. He informed Kenny that they should have a courtesy car from the hotel to pick the couriers up from the airport. He had many conversations and text messages with Li about the couriers being refused entry into Australia and then subsequent return to Vietnam. He then arranged for Huy to import heroin from Vietnam into Australia, arranging with Kenny to pay him between $5,000 and $10,000 for that activity.14 The fifth incident involved a man by the name of Michael. He was another courier used by the Kenny syndicate and he transported some heroin to Melbourne by vehicle with a man by the name of Ching. The offender’s role included arranging the supply over the telephone, confirming the price, receiving an SMS with the address at which the drugs were to be supplied, arranging for Michael to supply to Ngoc Nguyen, asking Michael to let him know when he arrived at Ngoc Nguyen’s premises, receiving updates as to the progress of the supplies, and making arrangements regarding the remittance of purchase price. 15 The sixth incident occurred between 25 April and 22 May 2006 and concerned the importation of twenty-four packages of heroin organised by the Kenny syndicate. The offender’s role in this importation included the remittance of money, discussions regarding that matter, arranging for the importation of the drugs, speaking about the quantity of drugs to be imported, keeping Kenny up to date with the arrangements, arranging for members of the syndicate to be at Sydney International Airport to keep observation on the man by the name of Trung, who was a Sydney drug dealer and a courier, collecting the packages of heroin from Mr Trung in Sydney, liaise with others as to how much they would pay, and then having conversations about the fact that they appear to have been short changed, receiving only twenty-four packages rather than twenty-five.16 Incident seven involved drug trafficking between 20 May 2006 and 24 May 2006. The heroin that I have just referred to was taken to Melbourne. The offender was involved in that trafficking as well, making arrangements to supply Ngoc Nguyen with the drugs. He also arranged for the remittance of money in a similar way as I have identified earlier. On this occasion the heroin appears to have been of poor quality, probably because it was cut to the extent that the purity was so low that it was unacceptable to the purchaser. The offender therefore went to Melbourne on 24 May, meeting with Ngoc Nguyen for the return of the heroin.17 Incident eight is another incident of trafficking between 25 May 2006 and 30 May 2006 and concerns the transport, again, of drugs from Sydney to Melbourne, this time by plane, and their supply to others in Melbourne. Once more the offender’s role was similar to that which I have outlined earlier, making many arrangements in order to see that this trafficking took place. Again the drugs were of poor quality.18 Incident nine concerned an incident of trafficking between 18 June 2006 and 29 June 2006. Police discovered, on 21 June 2006, 500 grams of crystal methylamphetamine and 90 grams of a common cutting agency in a taxi, in the possession of a man by the name of Koa. He was arrested and charged with supplying a prohibited drug. That drug supply had been organised by Kenny and the offender. It was intended that they would receive the drugs for onward supply. The arrangements that this involved are set out in a statement of facts and they reveal the considerable involvement of the offender in what occurred.19 The tenth incident concerns some heroin that had been imported from Vietnam to Sydney on or before 21 June 2006. This involved a quarter of a kilogram of heroin. 20 The syndicate became a bit concerned after Koa was arrested and so they repackaged the heroin which had been brought into Australia and kept it for safekeeping. However, it subsequently went missing and there was a falling out amongst the syndicate members over this missing heroin. Again, the offender’s involvement in this was substantial. 21 The offender played the role I have identified, of Kenny’s right hand man, enthusiastically and, it appears, efficiently. The syndicate was very successful, at least partly due to the offender’s ongoing illegal conduct. Many people appear for sentence in this court after having committed a single criminal act, but the offender’s illegal conduct in this case appears to have involved perhaps thousands of individual illegal acts. He was an essential part of the syndicate’s operations. At times Kenny was affected by drugs and so his ability to carry on the operation was compromised. On these occasions it seems that the offender had to step in and take control.22 The maximum penalty for the second count is life imprisonment. Objectively the offender’s conduct is such that it is approaching the worst category of conduct for which life imprisonment would be appropriate. 23 The offender, as I mentioned, was using drugs when he first approached Kenny to become involved. That may explain what he did but it does not mitigate it. If the offender had not been a drug addict at the time it would have been a matter of serious aggravation that he took on these activities as a person who was solely in this to make money. It has long been regarded as the law that those who become involved in drug trafficking, who are not themselves addicted to drugs, are in the worst category.24 Since his arrest the offender says that he has realised what he should have realised before. It is difficult to understand, sitting in this courtroom, how a person who, as the offender did, approaches a significant drug dealer and asks to be involved can do so without thinking of the consequences not only to himself but also to those to whom drugs are ultimately supplied. The offender knew full well the problems that drugs caused. He, himself, experienced those and yet he was prepared to drag others down to his level through his ongoing involvement in Kenny’s syndicate. It is worth repeating that the offender did this simply because he was attracted by Kenny’s lifestyle. He did try and stop, it must be acknowledged, shortly before he was arrested, but Kenny, obviously happy with the services that the offender was providing, would not let him, referring to substantial debts for drugs and gambling that the offender had accumulated. It is a matter in his favour that the offender at least tried to extricate himself, even if he was unsuccessful.25 I turn now to a matter about which I will have to exercise some circumspection. It concerns s 21E of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. The offender has offered to provide assistance which has been assessed as valuable, accurate and genuine. The offender has provided a great deal of information to the authorities, including information about matters the authorities were unaware of, such as the offender’s own drug use back in Canada. As a result of his assistance, or at least after his assistance, two members of the syndicate have pleaded guilty. Four are yet to face trial, and the offender undertakes to provide assistance in the prosecution of those four people, including the giving of evidence. I trust it will be obvious that the syndicate about which I am talking is a large one and there is a great deal of community interest and benefit through the members of the syndicate being prosecuted successfully.26 Directly as a result of the offender’s assistance he is in conditions of custody more appropriate to eighteenth century Van Dieman’s land than present day New South Wales. The offender is not allowed to talk to any other prisoner. He is denied access to the library. He is held in conditions of custody that I would describe as cruel. The one bright spot is that he receives regular visits from approved visitors, who include his family. Of course, part of the reason that those who assist the authorities get a reduction in their sentences is because they often do serve their sentences in such conditions. Another reason for discount in sentences is, because of the assistance, threats are made to the offender and his loved ones. In this case, it seems that there are genuine fears for the offender, and his family as well. His de facto wife has been approached by those who would seek to persuade her to seek to persuade the offender not to do what he has undertaken to do.27 The Court of Criminal Appeal has recently given some attention to the size of discounts for assistance to the authorities, combined as they almost invariably are with a discount for a plea of guilty. Part of the Court of Criminal Appeal’s recent attention to this topic has been in an effort to encourage some consistency. It is now the law that a discount in the order of fifty percent is appropriate for an offender giving substantial assistance, such as given by this offender, and where the conditions of custody that he will experience are likely to be harsher than usual. The Court of Criminal Appeal recognises that on rare occasions an even bigger discount is allowable, but this is not such a case. I will discount the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by fifty percent to reflect the plea of guilty which was acknowledged to be early and the assistance which was acknowledged to be substantial. 28 The offender’s assistance is perhaps the best evidence of all of his prospects for rehabilitation and his contrition. As Mr Ramage said, the offender is now doing his best to make amends for what he has done. The offender, and his wife also, expressed remorse for the offender’s conduct. I should note that some others involved in the syndicate have been sentenced, but they were for individual actions rather than the ongoing conspiracy committed by this offender. Parity, therefore, is of little application.29 In this case there is a substantial overlap between the three offences. Offences one and three are really subsets of the conspiracy in offence two. Without breaching any rule in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; 194 CLR 610; 156 ALR 684, I am able to take into account the conduct alleged in counts one and three, being part and parcel of what was implicitly and explicitly done in count two. 30 For those reasons, as I gather was conceded by the Crown, I will not accumulate sentences. I will impose a lengthy sentence on count two to reflect the criminality of that offence and fixed terms of imprisonment on counts one and three. Of course all of the sentences have been reduced by reason of the discount for assistance to the authorities. If this case had not involved the offender’s plea of guilty in assistance to the authorities it might well have been a case where the offender was sentenced to life imprisonment. As I said, the offender may not have been “Mr Big”, but he was “Mr Big Enough”. There is no rule that life imprisonment is reserved only for the “Mr Bigs” of the drug trafficking and importation world. The offender’s substantial involved objectively, as I mentioned earlier, may well have been enough to put him in the category of a case where life imprisonment is appropriate. However, not only is there the plea of guilty and assistance but the very genuine rehabilitation, contrition and remorse. 31 The sentences I will therefore impose are these. On counts one and three I set a fixed term of seven years. Those terms are fixed because of the sentence to be imposed on count two. On count two, after discounting the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by fifty percent to reflect the plea of guilty and assistance, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for thirteen and a half years to date from 14 December 2006. I set a non-parole period of nine years which will expire on 13 December 2015 on which date the offender is eligible to be released to parole. In accordance with s 21E of the Crimes Act I indicate that were it not for the offender’s undertaking to give assistance in the future I would have sentenced him to imprisonment for twenty years with a non-parole period of thirteen years on count two with an appropriate reduction in the fixed terms on counts one and three.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Barr J. 
     
      
    2 BARR J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court. On 7 June 2007 two indictments were presented against the applicant, Geoffrey Shaun Fieldsend. The first contained two counts, namely that on 6 December 2006 at Dubbo while armed with an offensive weapon he assaulted Cassie Lowe with intent to take a motor vehicle and took and drove the motor vehicle without the consent of Ms Lowe, the person in lawful possession, and that on 9 December 2006 at Dubbo he maliciously damaged the verandah of a certain house with intent to endanger the life of Sandra Kauter.  
     
      
    3 The second indictment contained two counts, namely that on 18 December 2006 at Dubbo, being armed with an offensive weapon, a machete, he robbed Bruce Fell of certain property and that on 19 December, also at Dubbo, being armed with the machete, he robbed Teresa Purvis of a cash till.  
     
      
    4 Also before the Court was a certificate under s166 Criminal Procedure Act containing a number of counts. Some were dismissed but the applicant fell to be sentenced for the following five offences, namely two counts of assault committed upon Ms Lowe, one count of knowingly contravening a prohibition specified in an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order, one count of being armed with a knife with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely the malicious wounding of Ms Lowe and one count of intimidating Ms Lowe with intent to cause her to fear physical or mental harm.  
     
      
    5 The applicant pleaded guilty to the four charges in the indictments and consented to being sentenced for the remainder of the charges listed in the s166 certificate. 
     
      
    6 The first count in the first indictment attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years and the second a maximum penalty of imprisonment of 25 years with a standard non-parole period of five years. The two offences in the second indictment each attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. 
     
      
    7 The maximum penalties available for the offences listed in the s166 certificate attracted only the maximum penalties that the Local Court could impose on summary disposal: see ss168, 267, 268. Effectively, that meant a maximum penalty of two years’ imprisonment for each offence. 
     
      
    8 Woods ADCJ sentenced the applicant for the first count in the second indictment to a non-parole period of three years commencing on 20 December 2006 and expiring on 19 December 2009 and a balance of term of nine months, and on the second count in that indictment to a non-parole period of three years commencing 20 December 2008 and expiring 19 December 2011 and a balance of term of nine months. 
     
      
    9 On the first indictment his Honour fixed for the first count a non-parole period of three years commencing on 20 December 2010 and expiring on 19 December 2013 and a balance of term of one year and six months. On the second count his Honour fixed a non-parole period of three years and six months commencing on 20 December 2011 and expiring on 19 June 2015 and a balance of term of one year and nine months. 
     
      
    10 For each of the five offences listed in the s166 certificate his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months commencing on 20 December 2010 and expiring on 19 December 2011. 
     
      
    11 His Honour declared that the applicant was eligible to be considered for release to parole on 19 June 2015. 
     
      
    12 The only one of the periods of eligibility for parole not subsumed by a succeeding non-parole period was the period of one year and nine months allowed for the second offence in the first indictment. The total effective sentence was thus a non-parole period of eight years and six months and a balance of term, with eligibility for release on parole, of one year and nine months.  
     
      
    13 The applicant and Ms Cassie Lowe were in a domestic relationship. They had a seven-month-old daughter. Early in December 2006 Ms Lowe obtained by telephone an interim Apprehended Domestic Violence Order, the import of which was to protect her from the applicant. The application for a final order was due to be considered at the Local Court Dubbo on 6 December. On the morning of that day the applicant and Ms Lowe were at home together. He took her mobile telephone and began searching it to try to ascertain the names of people she had been telephoning. He told her that he knew that she was speaking to people behind his back and had been requesting the police to arrest him. He told that he knew that she had something planned and demanded to know what it was. Ms Lowe denied these things and told the applicant that she was going to court to help him. The applicant was not to be denied. He repeated the question and after receiving the same answer pushed Ms Lowe onto the bed. He said that he was not to going to gaol just for hitting her. He would go for something else. He knelt over her and slapped her several times. He took out a pocket knife, opened it and pushed it towards her in a stabbing motion. Ms Lowe was in fear, crying. The applicant walked out of the bedroom. As they were getting ready to go to court he told her not to do anything stupid. He said that if she tried anything he would stab anyone. He would stab police officer in the neck if he had to. He said that she was not to leave his side while they were there. He said that he would not go to gaol just for hitting her, he would make it worth his while. If he was going to be locked up it would be for a long time. They went to court.  
     
      
    14 Those incidents were the foundation of the charges listed in the s166 certificate. 
     
      
    15 On the afternoon on the same day Ms Lowe and their daughter were visiting a friend, Mr Bell, in Dubbo. Ms Lowe had borrowed her mother’s car for the purpose and she parked it at the front of the house. Mr Bell left the house walked to the car and began to speak to Ms Lowe. Although Ms Lowe did not know it, the applicant was inside the house. He came running out and Mr Bell said “Quick, he’s coming. Drive.” Ms Lowe began to drive away but the applicant took hold of the front near side door, opened it and got into the passenger’s seat. He pulled out a knife and told Ms Lowe to drive. She was afraid and stopped the vehicle not far from Mr Bell’s house. The applicant lunged at her with the knife, threatening to stab her if she would not drive. Ms Lowe began to cry and got out of the car. The applicant moved into the driver’s seat and a tussle ensued. The applicant got out of the car and began to chase Ms Lowe. He returned to the vehicle and tried to remove the child and the baby seat. He began to chase Ms Lowe and then Mr Bell, swinging the knife in their direction. The applicant ran back to the car and got in. Ms Lowe ran to the vehicle and tried to pull the keys out of the ignition to stop the applicant driving the car away. As she did so he kicked at her. She fell to the ground. The applicant wrested the keys from her and drove away. The child was still in the seat in the rear of the car. The police were called. The child and the vehicle were recovered unharmed.16 That event gave rise to the first count in the first indictment.17 At about 10:00pm on 9 December 2006 Mrs Kauter was at her residence in Dubbo. Several other members of her family were present, including Ms Lowe and their daughter. A sensor-activated light came on at the front of the house, showing that somebody was moving close by. Ms Kauter went to the window and saw the applicant leaning over a brick wall that formed one side of the verandah. He had in his hand a tin can, holding it inverted, and splashing liquid from it over the timber floor of the verandah. He stood up and took out a cigarette lighter. Ms Kauter screamed out to those present that the applicant was going to set fire to the house. Those present ran into the rear yard. Ms Lowe noticed an orange glow coming from the verandah. The police attended. There was a strong smell of petrol and an area of charring on the timber floor and brick wall of the verandah. Fortunately, that was all the damage caused by the applicant.  
     
      
    18 That event was the subject of the second count in the first indictment.  
     
      
    19 On 18 December 2006 the applicant and another man entered a service station and shop in North Dubbo. The applicant was wearing a dark blue tracksuit and his face covered with a black balaclava. He was holding a machete. He jumped over the front counter into the operator’s console. Mr Brian Fell was on duty there. The applicant threatened him with the machete and used it to point at the cash drawer. He indicated that he wanted it. Mr Fell removed the cash drawer and handed it to the applicant. He put it inside a bag. He picked up a set of car keys belonging to Mr Fell. His companion stole goods from the business. The applicant took Mr Fell’s vehicle and drove it out of the premises. He picked up his colleague and drove away. It was later found abandoned in Dubbo. More than $600 was stolen from the business as well as a quantity of cigarettes.  
     
      
    20 That event was the subject of the first count in the second indictment. 
     
      
    21 On the following day 19 December 2006 the applicant, one other man and two young persons went to a hotel in Dubbo to commit a robbery. They took with them items to disguise their appearance and weapons, including a machete and baseball bats. At about 9:50pm Ms Teresa Purvis was working there as a bar attendant. The applicant and his companions entered, their faces disguised with balaclavas. Thr applicant was armed with a machete. The young persons had baseball bats. The applicant and the young persons tried to herd the hotel patrons together. In doing that the applicant brandished his machete. While that was going on one of the patrons, Jason Kemp picked up a stool and chased the applicant with it. The young persons struck him repeatedly with the baseball bats to keep him off the applicant. While that was happening the other offender, a man called Weldon, walked about the premises trying to get money from tills. Eventually he took one till and ran out of the hotel. The applicant and the young persons followed him. They were unable to open it and abandoned it. It was recovered intact. The applicant and his companions achieved nothing.  
     
      
    22 That event was the subject of the second count in the second indictment. 
     
      
    23 The applicant was arrested shortly after the last of these matters. He consented to be interviewed and made full admissions. 
     
      
    24 The offender was born on 19 April 1985, so he was 22 years old at the time of sentence. He is an aborigine, born in Bourke. His parents separated when he was four years old and he and his mother and siblings moved to Dubbo where he grew up. He has lost touch with his father but is in frequent touch with his mother. She lives and works in Dubbo.  
     
      
    25 During his tender years his mother had relationships with men who set him a bad example. He used to get into trouble at school because of fighting. He was expelled when he was found with cannabis. He worked in a shearing shed for a short time after leaving school but began committing offences. He was made subject to Children’s Court Control Orders for successive periods of six months, nine months and 12 months during the period 2001 to 2003. He had a relationship with a woman and there was a son now aged four. The applicant does not see the child. The relationship with Ms Lowe began in 2004. He spent eight months in custody in 2005.  
     
      
    26 He began to smoke cannabis at 11 years of age with his stepfather and his mates. By 12 or 13 years of age he had developed a habit and used the drug daily. He was later introduced to amphetamine and used to inject it. He used morphine to bring himself down. He began to use “ice” (methamphetamine) intravenously in 2005. This resulted in bizarre symptoms and led to arguments between himself and Ms Lowe. He developed paranoid thoughts and would stay awake all day and night to keep watch on the house. He had knives to protect himself. His mother tried unsuccessfully to get him to see a psychiatrist. During the time of the offences he was addicted to the use of ice and his bizarre and paranoid thoughts were probably involved in his motivation. Since his arrest he had detoxified from ice and exhibited insight into his actions, though, according to his consultant psychologist, Anita Duffy, he was still displaying some distortions on belief and attitudes.  
     
      
    27 A report of Ms Duffy was put before the Court. She assessed him as being above average in intelligence in non-verbal problem solving and reasoning. She thought that he had the potential to acquire a high level of skill in practical areas of work and that he should be encouraged to obtain training for employment during his time in custody. Ms Duffy commented on the applicant’s strong dependence on ice and other drugs and observed that he would need extensive drug and alcohol during his time in gaol. She considered that he could be considered for the new compulsory drug treatment program at the Parklea Correctional Centre. She noted his interest in undertaking a violence prevention program and thought, in view of history of fighting, that that would be constructive. She considered that the applicant had the ability to benefit from more intensive interventions and should be encouraged to do so. She considered that the supervision and support of the Probation and Parole Service would be necessary following his release. 
     
      
    28 In this Court Ms Manuell, for the applicant, acknowledged the seriousness of the offences but submitted that the aggregate sentence was crushing. She submitted that as a result the applicant would lose any realistic opportunity of meaningful rehabilitation in the community. The attack was not so much on the length of any individual sentence but on the degree of accumulation, bearing in mind that the offences were of a similar kind and that all were committed within a short period of time. It was submitted that the total sentence would keep the applicant in custody for eight years and six months and then allow an insufficient period of time, amounting only to one year and nine months, on parole in the community. That, it was submitted, was not best calculated to meet the applicant’s special needs if he were to have any reasonable chance of rehabilitation. Rather than adjusting the statutory norm to reduce the time available for parole to less than 20% of the head sentence, his Honour should have increased it. 
     
      
    29 Ms Manuell pointed to some discrete errors. His Honour said that he would order appropriate sentences for each count “which will have taken into account the matters on the Form 1”. What his Honour meant is unclear. There was no Form 1. It seems unlikely that his Honour was referring to the concurrent sentences for the s166 offences, since their concurrency could not justify any adjustment in the length of any individual sentence: Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57. 
     
      
    30 Dealing with the part played by the applicant in the robbery at the hotel, his Honour referred to the images taken by the surveillance cameras -  
     
      
       
        
        …the offender here now appears to be the eldest of that group and with his record of offending must be seen as having a leadership role.  
        
       
      
    31 Later in the judgment his Honour said -  
     
      
       
        
        …it is possible that with the hotel robbery he, as the eldest, could be seen as responsible for the involvement of the others which included two people under the age of 18 years. 
        
       
      
    32 The applicant gave evidence. He said that he did not regard himself as the ringleader but as the eldest of the robbers. That evidence was not challenged. 
     
      
    33 It was submitted in this Court that in the face of the applicant’s evidence his Honour was not entitled to conclude that by reason of his record and his age he could be seen as responsible for the involvement of the others. 
     
      
    34 In my opinion that attack has been made good. The detailed statement of facts did not deal with motivation or leadership or with the relative responsibility of the several actors other than simply stating what they did. I do not think that his Honour was entitled to be satisfied by reference alone to the age and any antecedents of the applicant that he was responsible of the involvement of others. 
     
      
    35 A further complaint was that his Honour had not properly considered the youth of the applicant. Reference was made to R v GDP (1991) 53 A Crim R 1 and R v Micallef (1990) 50 A Crim R 465. In fact his Honour twice referred to the applicant’s youth. In my opinion the principles referred in those cases have no strong application to the facts of the present appeal. Although the applicant was a young man (21 years old) when he committed these offences he was well past that range of ages which attracts the special need for considerations of rehabilitation to outweigh those of deterrence and retribution. 
     
      
    36 I do not think that this complaint has been made good. 
     
      
    37 In my opinion, even allowing for his Honour’s errors in the reference to the Form 1 and in categorising the applicant as a leader in the robberies, the sentences for those and all other offences fell within his Honour’s proper range of discretion. However, I think that the attack on the degree of accumulation of sentences and upon his Honour’s failure to take that accumulation into account under the provisions of s44 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act has been made good. I think that the Court should reconsider the degree of accumulation of the sentences and adjust the relationship between the effective non-parole period and the period available for parole in order to foster the applicant’s chances of rehabilitating in the community. 
     
      
    38 Affidavits were received on appeal in case the Court should interfere. The applicant said that he is at present classified as A2, which is maximum security, and as such is held at Lithgow gaol. It is hard for his family, who live in Dubbo, to visit him there. Once he has reached the point when he has fewer than seven years of his sentence to serve he will become eligible to be reclassified B. As such, he may be sent to Wellington, a place much closer to Dubbo. He is learning English formally and has registered for a course designed to help him regain control over his actions. It should lead to longer courses directed to drug rehabilitation and to head off repeat offending. The applicant has apologised in writing and face to face with Ms Lowe and they are now reconciled. The applicant’s mother strongly supports his efforts at rehabilitation.  
     
      
    39 It seems to me that his prospects of turning his life around, even at this early stage, appear reasonable, and that is taking advantage of the opportunities offered him. 
     
      
    40 I propose that the Court interfere with the sentences imposed for the four offences contained in the indictments. Although I would not vary the length of any sentence I would vary the relationship between the non-parole and parole components and the manner in which they are accumulated upon one another. My intention is to fashion sentences the aggregate effect of which is a head sentence of 10 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of seven years. I would not set parole periods for the two sentences commencing earliest in time since they would be wholly subsumed by the non-parole periods of the succeeding sentences. There are two circumstances that justify setting a period of eligibility for parole which exceeds one third of the non-parole period in the sentence that commences last, namely the accumulation of sentences and the need to provide a period of eligibility for parole that meets the special needs of the applicant in his rehabilitation. I would not interfere with the sentences imposed for the offences dealt under s166. 
     
      
    41 I propose the following orders - 
     
      
     1. Grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal. 
     
      
     2. Quash the sentences imposed for the four offences in the indictments. 
     
      
     3. In lieu of the sentence imposed for the first offence in the second indictment, sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of three years nine months, which will be taken to have commenced on 20 December 2006 and which will expire on 19 September 2010. 
     
      
     4. In lieu of the sentence imposed for the second offence in the second indictment, sentence the applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of three years and nine months, which will be taken to have commenced on 20 December 2007 and which will expire on 19 September 2011. 
     
      
     5. In lieu of the sentence imposed for the first offence in the first indictment sentence the applicant to imprisonment. Fix a non-parole period of four years, which will commence on 20 December 2009 and expire on 19 December 2013. Fix a balance of term during which the applicant will be entitled to consideration for release on parole of six months, which will commence on 20 December 2013 and expire on 19 June 2014. 
     
      
     6. In lieu of the sentence imposed for the second offence in the first indictment sentence the applicant to imprisonment. Fix a non-parole period of two years and three months which will commence on 20 September 2011 and expire on 19 December 2013. The balance of term, during which the applicant will be entitled to consideration for release on parole will commence on 20 December 2013 and expire on 19 December 2016. 
     
      
     7. Declare that the first day upon which the applicant will be eligible to be considered for release on parole will be 19 December 2013. 
     
      
    42 PRICE J: I agree with Barr J.

     SELA RATU QORO v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with Johnson J. 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J: The Appellant, Sela Ratu Qoro, appeals against conviction and seeks leave to appeal against sentence arising from his conviction and sentence in the Sydney District Court for an offence of aggravated sexual assault in company contrary to s.61JA(1) Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    3 The Appellant was convicted following a trial before his Honour Judge Berman SC and a jury which commenced on 28 August 2006 and concluded on 14 September 2006. The offence for which the Appellant was convicted carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for life with a standard non-parole period of 15 years. On 24 April 2007, the Appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 14 years, comprising a non-parole period of 10 years to date from 4 January 2006 and to expire on 3 January 2016, with a balance of term of four years to date from 4 January 2016 and to expire on 3 January 2020.  
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    4 The grounds of appeal against conviction contained in the Notice of Appeal filed on 23 January 2008 were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) Ground 1 - the trial miscarried as a result of the learned trial Judge’s error in not discharging the jury. 
       
       
      (b) Ground 2 - the learned trial Judge erred in failing to withdraw from the jury the picture identification evidence. 
       
      
    5 At the hearing of the appeal, the Appellant was granted leave to add the following ground: 
     
      
       
      (a) Ground 3 - the Crown opened its case on a different basis than the basis left to the jury such that it caused unfair prejudice to the Appellant. 
       
      
    6 The grounds of appeal against sentence pressed at the hearing were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) Ground 4 - the learned sentencing Judge erred in finding that there was no connection between the Appellant’s psychiatric condition and his moral culpability. 
       
       
      (b) Ground 5 - the learned sentencing Judge erred in that he failed to give adequate weight in the sentencing discretion to the Appellant’s psychiatric condition. 
       
      
    7 At the hearing of the appeal, counsel for the Appellant abandoned a ground of appeal against sentence based upon suggested disparity between the sentence imposed on the Appellant and sentences imposed upon co-offenders, Everett Charles Weatherall and Raymond Noel King. 
     
      
       
      The s.61JA(1) Charge 
       
      
    8 The Appellant was charged on a joint indictment with Everett Charles Weatherall and each separately faced two counts, one contrary to s.61JA(1) Crimes Act 1900 with an alternative count of aggravated sexual assault contrary to s.61J(1) of that Act. As will be seen, on 6 September 2006, the jury were discharged in relation to the co-accused, Weatherall and the trial continued with respect to the Appellant only. 
     
      
    9 The Appellant was convicted of the s.61JA(1) charge which was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Between 23 and 26 November 2005 at Redfern in the State of New South Wales, whilst in the company of other male persons,  
        [he]  
        did have sexual intercourse with  
        [the complainant]  
        without her consent knowing that she was not consenting thereto, and did deprive her of her liberty for a period before the commission of the said offence.” 
        
       
       
      Issues in the Trial 
       
      
    10 It was the Crown case that the Appellant was one of a group of men, of whom Weatherall was the leader, who prevented the complainant, a 20-year old woman, from leaving a terrace house in Redfern and, whilst she was so detained, a number of men (including the Appellant) had sexual intercourse with her without her consent. The case against the Appellant relied upon direct evidence, namely the complainant’s identification of the Appellant, together with evidence that suggested that her identification was reliable - that her assailant’s penis was unusual (as the complainant had related) and as evidenced by photographs taken by the police and the testimony of the Appellant’s wife in the defence case. 
     
      
    11 The Appellant maintained that he was not in the house at the relevant time and adduced alibi evidence. It was submitted for the Appellant at trial that the combination of limited opportunity to inspect her assailant due to the nature of the activity she was forced to engage in (fellatio), bad light and other factors, including the nature of the horrific ordeal that she was subjected to, was such that her identification of the Appellant was mistaken. 
     
      
       
      The Case Against the Appellant 
       
      
    12 To place the appeal against conviction into context, it is useful to set out part of the remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Berman SC concerning the Appellant’s offence (ROS 1): 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence at the trial involving Mr Qoro established that on 24 November 2005, the complainant was sexually assaulted by a very large number of men in a bedroom on the first floor of a terrace house in Eveleigh Street, Redfern. It was impossible, when listening to the complainant give her evidence, not to be struck by the callousness with which she was treated by the men who were assaulting her. She was treated as an object for their sexual gratification and nothing more. She was not treated as a human being. Those assaulting her cared nothing about the distress she was undergoing and the damage they were causing. 
         
         
        The complainant identified Charles Weatherall as being the ring leader. She was forced to perform oral sex on him and he incited others to sexually assault her, at one time urging them to, ‘be as rough as you like, she likes it’. 
         
         
        The complainant was held prisoner while various men abused her. She was subjected to anal and vaginal sexual assaults, as well as being forced to perform oral sex on many men who at this stage remain unidentified. These matters all took place in the first floor bedroom and there is no evidence to establish that this offender was one of the men who assaulted the complainant at that stage. 
         
         
        The evidence as to what the offender did to the complainant concerned what happened after she was moved to an adjacent room where there was a couch and minimal furniture. She was thrown on to that couch and seated next to a young man who had been in the bedroom earlier. She described in evidence what happened. She referred to the offender as the ‘islander guy’, so in view of the jury's verdict, when reading the complainant's account of what happened to her at the hands of the offender, I will use the words ‘the offender’ where the complainant has used the words ‘the islander guy’. This is what the complainant said, 
         
         
          
          ‘I got taken in there and got pushed down onto a sofa and the young guy had come and sit on the left-hand side of me and there was the offender. And I can't remember who it was but someone had taken me in there and the offender came in and stood in front of me on the sofa and had pulled out his penis and grabbed the back of my hair and started making me give him oral sex. He was holding the back of my head and when the young guy came and sat on the left-hand side of me, he was trying to grab my head away from the offender and at first he was grabbing my hands, trying to make me rub his penis and then he was trying to pull my head away from the man standing in front of me to force it down on his penis.’ 
          
         
         
        She described the offender this way, 
         
         
          
          ‘He had a really large stomach, he was fat and wearing beige shorts and a dark green t-shirt with a short sleeveless shirt over the top. And he had a white hat on backwards and you could see dreadlocks coming out of the side. I'd noticed while he was making me give him oral sex that he had three sort of black marks, sort of circles. They weren't like the lump that Charles had, they were black and they were scattered on the top of his penis.’ 
          
         
         
        The complainant gave evidence that the offender ejaculated during that particular act of oral sex. After the complainant had been subjected to this dreadful assault, a man identified as Shaun Weatherall rescued her. She was led to safety by him. He gave her a drink and the opportunity to dress herself and some money to get home. She went to the nearby home of a female acquaintance and made immediate complainant  
        [sic]  
        of having been raped. 
         
         
        The evidence against the offender was remarkably strong. His case was one of mistaken identity but there was significant evidence in the trial to prove that the offender was the man who had forced the complainant to have sexual intercourse without consent in the second room. That evidence concerned three lumps which the complainant observed on the islander guy's penis which later turned out to match the three lumps that the offender has in his penis. Some of the strongest evidence to establish the accuracy of identification of the offender came, inadvertently no doubt, from the offender's wife. The complainant described the penis of the man who was assaulting her as very small with three marks along the top. She said, 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘On the top of his penis there were - I don't know if they were black warts or whatever - but they were different sizes and they were on the top of his penis.’ 
          
         
         
        The Crown case established that the offender does have three lumps of different sizes on his penis. Mrs Qoro gave evidence that her husband had three lumps on his penis. This was consistent with what a police officer noted when he made an examination of the offender's genitals. 
         
         
        In the trial there was some evidence called as to the practice of genital beading amongst some cultures. The offender gave evidence at trial that that was a practice that he had followed and that was how he got the lumps on his penis. As I told the jury, as a matter of logic, the more unusual the accused's penis is, then the greater the support for the Crown case that the complainant describes these unusual features. 
         
         
        The Crown case was that the complainant got right an impressive number of unusual details. Not only did she know about the lumps but on top of that she knew how many there were and that they weren't all the same size. I reminded the jury also that although the complainant said that the lumps were on top of the offender's penis, in fact they turned out to be in a different location. Nevertheless, as the jury verdict indicates, they were clearly satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was correctly identified as being the man who sexually assaulted the complainant in the second room. 
         
         
        It is important to remember that the charge for which the offender is to be sentenced contains within it an element concerning the offender's detention of the complainant, before he had sexual intercourse with her. The Crown allegation, which the jury accepted, was that the offender was part of a group of men who kept the complainant where she was so they could have sexual intercourse with her without her consent. Each of the men who had sex with the complainant, including the offender, were, according to the Crown, all part of a group of men who amongst other things kept the complainant a prisoner, that is they stopped her from leaving the house so they could all have their turn at assaulting her. Clearly the jury accepted that this offender was part of a joint criminal enterprise with others, who agreed that they would detain the complainant that evening. 
         
          
         
        The evidence and the nature of the charge thus established that the offender is not to be sentenced as though he did not know about what had happened to the complainant before he sexually assaulted her. I will sentence the offender on the basis that when he forced the complainant to perform oral sex on him, he well knew that she had already been subjected to degrading and repeated forced sexual intercourse at the hands of a number of other men. 
         
         
        … The offender was in company with only one other man at the time he sexually assaulted the complainant, although there were a significant number of other men nearby. He was clearly involved in the joint criminal enterprise to deprive the complainant, that enterprise being an agreement between many others.” 
        
       
      
    13 Given a further issue raised on the appeal, it is appropriate to refer to the following part of the evidence at trial. Soon after the complainant left the house in Eveleigh Street, she met an acquaintance, Natasha Tighe, who observed that the complainant was crying. The complainant said she had just been raped. Ms Tighe told her not to have a shower or change her clothes. The following morning, Ms Tighe took the complainant to the Aboriginal Medical Centre and thereafter, she was transported to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where she was examined by Dr Patricia Brennan. She was spoken to by police who arranged to take a statement from her.  
     
      
    14 After the assault, the complainant saw the “Islander guy” in Eveleigh Street, Redfern and pointed him out to Ms Tighe. On 13 January 2006, the complainant was shown a photo array and immediately picked out the “Islander guy”, selecting a photograph of the Appellant. 
     
      
    15 In cross-examination by counsel for the Appellant, Ms Tighe said that, after the first police interview, she and the complainant were walking in Eveleigh Street when they saw a group of men on the road. The complainant pointed out four men who had violated her, one of whom was the “Islander”. In re-examination, Ms Tighe clarified that the “Islander” pointed out to her by the complainant was “Sela … him” being the Appellant who was in Court. Ms Tighe said that she had seen the Appellant three times in the few days after the attack. 
     
      
    16 The Appellant was arrested on 4 January 2006 (T154). The Appellant declined to participate in an ERISP, but agreed to a buccal swab and the taking of forensic photographs of his genitals (T155). Three lumps were visible on the Appellant’s penis half-way between the scrotum and the tip of the penis on the right-hand side (T397-398).  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 - Refusal to Discharge the Jury 
       
      
    17 As mentioned earlier, the trial commenced on 28 August 2006 as a joint trial of the Appellant and Everett Charles Weatherall. On 6 September 2006, the trial Judge acceded to an application by Weatherall's defence counsel to discharge the jury in relation to his client. For present purposes, it is not necessary to recite in any detail the reason for this decision. It is sufficient to note that counsel for Weatherall had made application under s.293 Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to cross-examine the complainant with respect to the presence of Raymond Noel King at a time when an act of sexual intercourse was alleged by Weatherall to have occurred with the complainant some days before 24 November 2005. Counsel for Weatherall had informed the trial Judge that King was to be called as a witness in Weatherall’s defence case. However, on 5 September 2006, following the receipt of DNA analysis, police determined to charge King with sexual assault offences arising out of the events which gave rise to the trial of the Appellant and Weatherall. The trial Judge was satisfied that it was in the interests of justice that the jury be discharged in relation to Weatherall given this recent development. 
     
      
    18 I note that Weatherall and King later stood trial before his Honour Judge Woods QC and a jury for sexual assault offences against the complainant. Both were convicted and, on 20 September 2007, sentenced to lengthy terms of imprisonment. It was these sentences which gave rise to the parity ground of appeal on sentence abandoned by the Appellant at the hearing of the present appeal. 
     
      
    19 Following the discharge of the jury on 6 September 2006 concerning Weatherall, the trial Judge informed the jury that they had been discharged with respect to the trial of Weatherall, but would continue with the trial of the Appellant. No objection was taken at that time by trial counsel for the Appellant (who did not appear on appeal) to the explanation provided to the jury by the trial Judge in this respect (T546-547).  
     
      
    20 On the morning of 7 September 2006, counsel for the Appellant made application for discharge of the jury on two bases - firstly, the discharge of the jury in relation to Weatherall and, secondly, the effect of the in-court identification of the Appellant by Ms Tighe (see [15] above). The trial Judge declined to discharge the jury (Judgment, 7 September 2006). In the course of giving reasons for this decision, his Honour stated that: 
     
      
       
      (a) he was satisfied that a direction could be given to the jury to overcome any problems which may have arisen from the discharge of the jury with respect to Weatherall (Judgment, page 2); 
       
       
      (b) a direction would be given to the jury that the new evidence leading to the discharge of the jury (concerning King) related to Weatherall only and not the Appellant (Judgment, page 2); 
       
       
      (c) the cases concerning Weatherall and the Appellant were linked because they were run as a joint trial but this did not mean that they were linked in the sense that now that Weatherall had disappeared from the scene, the Appellant could not get a fair trial (Judgment, page 2); 
       
       
      (d) the joint trial of the Appellant and Weatherall had proceeded without any suggestion that it was unfair to the Appellant for this to happen and that nothing that occurred after the Weatherall discharge caused it to be unfair to the Appellant (Judgment, page 4); 
       
       
      (e) with respect to the in-court identification of the Appellant by Ms Tighe, his Honour observed that she identified the  
      “Islander” 
       as Sela, that there could not have been an objection to that evidence and that the only part about which legitimate complaint could be made concerned Ms Tighe identifying which particular Sela she was referring to by reference to the man who was then in Court seated in the dock - the effect of the in-court identification was limited and, although it would have been better if it had not occurred, his Honour was satisfied that he would be able to direct the jury to ignore the in-court identification and that there would be no prejudice at all to the Appellant (Judgment, pages 5-7); 
       
       
      (f) neither of the two bases relied upon in support of the discharge application, either individually or together, meant that the Appellant could not have a fair trial and his Honour was satisfied it was in the interests of justice that the trial continue (Judgment, page 8).  
       
      
    21 I note that his Honour duly directed the jury in the summing up in the areas foreshadowed in his judgment of 7 September 2006. No complaint is made on appeal concerning his Honour’s directions in those respects. 
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    22 Mr Brady, counsel for the Appellant (who appeared for the Appellant in the District Court on sentence, but not at trial), acknowledged that the failure to discharge a jury is not a ground in itself and that it is necessary to demonstrate that a miscarriage of justice has occurred. He contended that a miscarriage had occurred in this case as a result of the refusal to discharge the jury on 7 September 2006. In written submissions, he contended that: 
     
      
       
      (a) inadmissible and prejudicial evidence was before the jury, being evidence which was only admissible against Weatherall; 
       
       
      (b) the Appellant was faced with  
      “an entirely different trial dynamic”  
      following the discharge of the jury with respect to Weatherall; 
       
       
      (c) there was a risk that the jury would speculate about the new evidence (concerning King) that led to the discharge of the jury and that the jury might form an unfavourable view of the Appellant in this respect; 
       
       
      (d) there was a real risk that the in-court identification by Ms Tighe would inappropriately strengthen the Crown case against the Appellant.  
       
      
    23 In addition to these matters, Mr Brady relied upon the following matters as being prejudicial to the Appellant: 
     
      
       
      (a) a passing reference by a Crown witness to the fact that the Appellant had been arrested in December 2005, being an arrest unrelated to the trial; 
       
       
      (b) a reference by the Appellant’s wife to the Appellant having been in prison at one stage.  
       
      
    24 In oral submissions, Mr Brady developed an argument that the trial Judge and defence trial counsel had not understood until late in the trial (on 12 September 2006) that the Crown was to rely upon the doctrine of joint criminal enterprise against the Appellant with respect to the element of deprivation of liberty. Mr Brady submitted that, in some way, this development could be related back to the refusal of the trial Judge to discharge the jury on 7 September 2006. 
     
      
    25 It became increasingly apparent during Mr Brady’s submissions that this issue provided no real assistance to him in support of Ground 1. The trial Judge had heard and determined the discharge application made on 7 September 2006 by reference to the arguments advanced in support of that application. Thereafter, the trial proceeded until 14 September 2006. No further application was made by defence counsel to discharge the jury. Faced with this difficulty, Mr Brady formulated a fresh ground of appeal which he advanced, without opposition from the Crown, at the hearing of the appeal, being Ground 3 to which I will shortly turn. 
     
      
    26 I propose to deal with Ground 1 by reference to the arguments advanced by Mr Brady in his written submissions. With respect to these issues, the Crown submitted that his Honour’s refusal of the application to discharge the jury was a proper exercise of discretion, there was no error in principle and that the refusal to discharge the jury did not occasion any risk of a miscarriage of justice, much less a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    27 The Crown submitted that the offence charged against the Appellant was significantly related to those alleged against Weatherall, their offences having occurred in the same house, during the same evening, in rooms next to each other and upon the same victim. It was never the case that only a small fraction of evidence led at trial was admissible against the Appellant. Furthermore, the Crown case against the Appellant included the allegation that he was a knowing participant in a criminal enterprise, of which Weatherall was the principal and which involved unidentified others, to detain the complainant in order for them to have sexual intercourse without her consent (SU39-43).  
     
      
    28 In the context of a trial in which the central issue was whether the Appellant was the “Islander guy” who perpetrated the offence in the second room, not that the events had not occurred, the Crown submitted that it could not be demonstrated that any prejudice was caused by the jury hearing evidence adduced prior to the discharge concerning Weatherall. The Crown submitted that directions given by the trial Judge that the jury should take into account cross-examination by Weatherall’s counsel in favour of the Appellant (a direction sought by the Appellant’s counsel) could not prejudice the Appellant. Further, directions given by the trial Judge to the jury concerning the new evidence (about King) and the in-court identification by Ms Tighe caused no prejudice to the Appellant. The references to the Appellant’s arrest on an unrelated matter and his time in prison were not significant in the context of the trial and, in any event, were the subject of a direction by the trial Judge.  
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    29 The failure to discharge a jury is not a ground of appeal in itself. The appeal is against conviction: Maric v The Queen (1978) 52 ALJR 631 at 634. The question on appeal is whether there was such a high degree of necessity for the jury’s discharge on 7 September 2006 that the failure to order such a discharge has resulted in a mistrial. Much leeway must be allowed for the trial Judge to evaluate considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial, bearing in mind that the Judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the events complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading a transcript: Crofts v The Queen [1996] 186 CLR 427 at 440-441. Nevertheless, the duty of the appellate court, where the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge is challenged, is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind. This Court must also decide for itself whether, in these circumstances, the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice: Crofts v The Queen at 441. 
     
      
    30 I have considered the arguments advanced to the trial Judge in support of the discharge application and his Honour’s reasons for refusing that application. It has not been submitted that his Honour applied an incorrect principle in determining the discharge application. His Honour was alive to the issues in the trial and the consequences which may result from the discharge of the jury with respect to the co-accused, Weatherall. In my view, his Honour’s decision to decline to discharge the jury was a proper exercise of discretion in the circumstances. The arguments advanced raised theoretical possibilities or, to the extent that areas of possible prejudice were more clearly identified, the issues were met by directions given to the jury by the trial Judge. No error has been demonstrated in his Honour’s decision declining to discharge the jury. 
     
      
    31 Insofar as counsel in this Court seeks to rely upon other arguments and, indeed, events which occurred after 7 September 2006 (such as the passing reference to the Appellant’s arrest on another matter and his having been in prison in the past), the short answer is that trial counsel made no further application to discharge the jury. Mr Brady did not contend that, in some way, it was incumbent on the trial Judge to discharge the jury of his own motion (T9.29, 27 May 2008). In any event, his Honour gave the jury appropriate directions concerning these matters in the summing up (SU30-32) about which no complaint is made on appeal.  
     
      
    32 It has not been demonstrated that the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. In my view, the first ground of appeal against conviction ought be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 - Suggested Change in Crown Case 
       
      
    33 It is convenient to next consider Ground 3 which was argued, by leave, at the hearing of the appeal.  
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    34 As mentioned above (at [24]-[25]), Mr Brady commenced to put this submission in support of Ground 1. It became apparent during the hearing that this argument could not advance materially the Appellant’s case in support of that ground, given that no application was made for discharge of the jury on this basis either on 7 September 2006 or at any later time during the trial. Mr Brady’s oral argument was that, in some way, the trial Judge had erred in not discharging the jury upon a basis which had never been advanced to him for discharge, and that a miscarriage of justice had resulted. When confronted with this difficulty by the Court during argument, Mr Brady sought leave to add a further ground of appeal in the form of Ground 3. The Crown did not oppose a grant of leave in this respect. 
     
      
    35 In essence, Mr Brady contends that a miscarriage of justice has occurred arising from the trial Judge leaving to the jury a possible basis for conviction which had not been opened by the Crown. He submits that the Crown did not open to the jury that the evidence of events in the first bedroom could be relied upon as evidence of a joint criminal enterprise (including the Appellant) to deprive the complainant of her liberty on the evening in question. He submitted that the Crown opening had not introduced this concept against the Appellant (T62-66).  
     
      
    36 Mr Brady submitted that, in the circumstances of the case, the late introduction of the concept of joint criminal enterprise with respect to the element of deprivation of liberty caused unfair prejudice to the Appellant so that a miscarriage of justice has resulted. He submitted that it was not until the end of the Crown closing address that it became apparent that the Crown was seeking to rely upon the events in the first room against the Appellant in support of the element of deprivation of liberty and, in this respect, was relying on joint criminal enterprise. He submitted that it was reasonable to assume that defence counsel had not realised that the Crown was putting its case in this way until this was made clear by the Crown Prosecutor to the trial Judge in response to a query from his Honour following the Crown closing address. 
     
      
    37 The Crown submitted on appeal that the evidence of events in the first room was admissible in the trial of the Appellant, and would have been admitted and relied upon by the Crown even if the trial had not commenced as a joint trial with Weatherall. It was submitted that no prejudice had been demonstrated by the Appellant in the way that events unfolded at the trial.  
     
      
       
      Approach During the Trial to The Elements of Deprivation of Liberty and Being In Company 
       
      
    38 The Crown Prosecutor had opened with respect to the allegations against both Weatherall and the Appellant, and concluded the Crown opening, by way of summary of the issues, saying (T66): 
     
      
       
        
        “Firstly Weatherall, then Qoro, sexually assaulted her by inserting his penis into her mouth in circumstances where other males were present. That is the element of in company. And in circumstances where she was not allowed to leave. That is the deprivation of liberty.” 
        
       
      
    39 Mr Brady pointed to defence counsel’s understanding, at the time of the Weatherall jury discharge application, that the Appellant was said to be “in company” with the young man in the room and not other persons (T539). During the course of the Appellant’s discharge application, there was discussion concerning the person or persons with whom the Appellant was said to be ”in company”.  
     
      
    40 The trial Judge expressed his understanding that the Appellant was said to be in company with the young man present in the second room when the Appellant was alleged to have assaulted the complainant (T2-3, 7 September 2006). After his Honour declined the Appellant’s discharge application, there was further discussion, in the absence of the jury, concerning the elements of deprivation of liberty and being in company (T16-17, 7 September 2006). The trial Judge made clear that the element of being “in company” required the physical presence of a person or persons in the second room at the time when the Appellant allegedly assaulted the complainant (T16, 7 September 2006). The Crown made clear that, with respect to the element of deprivation of liberty, reliance was placed upon the circumstances in which the complainant came to be in the house, and events which occurred in the first bedroom (T16-17, 7 September 2006). All of this was said before the Defence case had opened. Defence counsel made no application for a verdict by direction by reference to either of the elements of deprivation of liberty or being in company. 
     
      
    41 The Crown closing address identified the young man said to have been present when the Appellant sexually assaulted the complainant as being the person relied upon in support of the element of being “in company” (T729). With respect to the element of deprivation of liberty, the Crown reminded the jury of the complainant’s evidence about Weatherall taking her into the house leading to her being brought to the first bedroom where she was sexually assaulted by a number of men before being taken into the sitting room (the second room) against her will and being forced to have sex in there (T735-736). The Crown submitted that the “Islander” (the Appellant) (T736-737): 
     
      
       
        
        “… who arrived in that sitting room, must have been in the house and must have been aware of what was going on. And was involved in the grotesque episode whereby he further deprived her of her liberty for his own sexual gratification. That is the only inference that can be drawn from her evidence as to how she came into this house and how she came to leave it, a man who had some sense of decency arrived and said, ‘give her a break’. What does that tell you? Somebody in that house realised that this woman was being subjected to fierce and prolonged physical and undoubtedly sexual abuse and he led her to safety.  
        
       
       
        
        Members of the jury if anyone had been in that house that night other than the saviour he must have been aware of the fact that she was being detained there against her will. From all the evidence the Crown submits that you would be in no doubt that she was deprived of her liberty before she was subjected to the offences which are the basis of count and which are incorporated into count one, the aggravated count.” 
        
       
      
    42 At the conclusion of the Crown address and in the absence of the jury, discussion ensued between the trial Judge and the Crown Prosecutor concerning the manner of proof of the element of deprivation of liberty (T745-747). In response to a question from the trial Judge, the Crown agreed that it relied upon joint criminal enterprise in this respect (T746). Defence counsel made no submission on the issue. No objection was taken nor was any expression of surprise made in this respect. Shortly thereafter, defence counsel delivered her closing address to the jury (T749-760).  
     
      
    43 Defence counsel said to the jury that the Appellant’s case was “very simple” and was that he did not have oral sex with the complainant, was not in the Eveleigh Street premises at the time, but was at home with his family (T751). Understandably, the defence closing address focused almost entirely on this issue, which was the central issue in the trial. Defence counsel told the jury that they ought be “very careful” in considering the evidence of deprivation of liberty against the Appellant (T751). 
     
      
    44 The trial Judge summed up to the jury on 13 September 2006, the morning after closing addresses of counsel. Before the summing up, and in the absence of the jury, defence counsel made submissions concerning the element of being “in company” (T2-3, 13 September 2006). Defence counsel made a short additional submission to the jury which did not touch on the element of deprivation of liberty or any factual matters concerning joint criminal enterprise.  
     
      
    45 In the course of his summing up, the trial Judge gave directions to the jury concerning the elements of being in company (SU37-38) and deprivation of liberty (SU38-43). In the course of the direction concerning deprivation of liberty, his Honour directed the jury concerning joint criminal enterprise (SU40-43). Before concluding the summing up, the trial Judge gave the jury a short additional direction concerning the element of deprivation of liberty at the request of the Crown (SU59-60).  
     
      
    46 At no point before, during or after the summing up did defence counsel object to the direction concerning joint criminal enterprise or ask for any further direction on this issue. No complaint was made concerning the reference to joint criminal enterprise. It was not said that the introduction of this concept at that time had caused any prejudice to the Appellant. No application was made for discharge of the jury on this or any other basis.  
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    47 It is sometimes argued in this Court that a miscarriage of justice has occurred arising from the trial Judge leaving to the jury a possible basis of conviction which had not been relied upon by the Crown: Robinson v R (2006) 162 A Crim R 88 at 127-129 [137]-[149]; Smale v R [2007] NSWCCA 328 at [79]ff; Sieders v R [2008] NSWCCA 187 at [197]-[212]. The question to be considered by the Court of Criminal Appeal is whether there has been unfairness to the accused which gives rise to a miscarriage of justice by reason of the conduct of the trial and which requires the Court’s intervention: Robinson v R at 129 [149]. In considering such a ground, it is appropriate to consider whether there has been any procedural or substantive unfairness to the Appellant.  
     
      
    48 With respect to procedural unfairness, it is appropriate to observe that no complaint was made by trial counsel concerning the introduction of the concept of joint criminal enterprise to the trial. Accordingly, the Appellant requires leave under Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules to rely upon Ground 3. 
     
      
    49 In this case, the trial Judge sought clarification from the Crown Prosecutor at the conclusion of the Crown closing address as to the evidence relied upon by the Crown with respect to the element of deprivation of liberty. The Crown submitted that reliance was placed upon the body of evidence concerning the taking of the complainant from the street and the commission of a series of sexual assaults by a number of men in the Eveleigh Street premises in the first room in support of its case against the Appellant on this element. Defence counsel did not object nor express surprise at this statement. Defence counsel had not, at that stage, embarked upon her closing address to the jury. Accordingly, defence counsel was aware of the factual and legal basis upon which the Crown put its case in this respect before she came to address the jury. Defence counsel touched upon this issue in her closing address relatively shortly. This was understandable. The Defence case was that the Appellant was not in the house at all and reliance was placed upon alibi evidence. As I have already mentioned, no objection was taken to the trial Judge directing the jury concerning the concept of joint criminal enterprise before, during or after the summing up, nor was any further direction sought by defence counsel on that issue. No complaint is made on the present appeal concerning the content of the direction given to the jury on joint criminal enterprise. 
     
      
    50 Although some question had been raised by defence counsel concerning the evidence relied upon by the Crown with respect to the element of being in company, this issue had been clarified prior to the commencement of closing addresses. 
     
      
    51 It was clear from the Crown closing address that the Crown relied upon evidence surrounding the taking of the complainant from the street, and her detention in the first room of the Eveleigh Street premises whilst sexual assaults were perpetrated upon her by several men, in support of the element of deprivation insofar as it applied to the Appellant. The evidence of events in the first room was admissible in the trial of the Appellant and, in my view, would have been admitted even if he was being tried alone.  
     
      
    52 The development in the trial about which the Appellant now complains was the introduction of the concept of joint criminal enterprise in directions to the jury. It is one of the functions of the trial Judge to ensure that appropriate directions of law are given to a jury with respect to the issues falling for determination at a particular trial. His Honour clarified the question with the Crown, in the absence of the jury and before the defence closing address, and proceeded to direct the jury accordingly without objection from defence counsel. 
     
      
    53 It has not been demonstrated that the trial Judge left a case to the jury which had not been relied upon by the Crown. In any event, simply because a trial Judge leaves to the jury a case or arguments not relied upon by the Crown (which is not this case), it does not follow that there has of necessity been a miscarriage of justice, nor is it such a defect in the trial that Rule 4 cannot apply. If, by putting an argument or a case to the jury that was not put by the Crown, some real unfairness has arisen to the accused, it is difficult to imagine that defence counsel would not object: Smale v R at [97]. 
     
      
    54 I would reject the submission that there has been a denial of procedural fairness in this case. 
     
      
    55 Likewise, I do not accept that any substantive unfairness to the Appellant resulted from the circumstances of this trial. The central defence in this trial was one of alibi, that is the Appellant was not in the Eveleigh Street premises and did not sexually assault the complainant at all. It has not been demonstrated that it was unfairly prejudicial to the Appellant, or otherwise erroneous, to have the evidence of events in the first room before the jury at the Appellant’s trial. The direction of law with respect to joint criminal enterprise was one which arose from the evidence adduced in the trial. Defence counsel had notice of the Crown’s case on this issue and did not object or otherwise complain to the trial Judge. It has not been demonstrated on appeal that the Appellant was unfairly prejudiced in any way so that this Court ought conclude that a miscarriage of justice has resulted.  
     
      
    56 I would decline the Appellant leave under Rule 4 to rely upon Ground 3 but, even if leave was granted, I would, in any event, reject that ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - Failing to Withdraw from the Jury the Picture Identification Evidence 
       
      
    57 On 31 August 2006, the fourth day of the trial, the Crown adduced evidence from the complainant, without objection, concerning photo identification by the complainant of the Appellant (see [14] above). The photo array was tendered without objection (T201). Counsel for the Appellant cross-examined the complainant on 4 September 2006 concerning the photographic identification and the complainant agreed that the only person in the photographs with dreadlocks was the Appellant (T319-320). 
     
      
    58 On 11 September 2006, the eleventh day of the trial, defence counsel made application to the trial Judge to withdraw the photographic identification from the jury and to abort the trial (T569-570). The main thrust of the defence application was that the probative value of the photo identification was significantly outweighed by the dangers of unfair prejudice to the Appellant so that the evidence ought be rejected under s.137 Evidence Act 1995. The trial Judge refused the application (Judgment, 11 September 2006).  
     
      
    59 In his reasons for refusing the application, the learned trial Judge noted the defence argument concerning the displacement effect. It was argued that the complainant had given evidence that she was sexually assaulted by an Islander man in a poorly lit room where she was forced to perform oral sex on that man. Reliance was placed upon evidence that suggested that the complainant did not get a good look at the man’s face at that time. When the complainant saw a man in the street a couple of days later, she recognised him as being one of the men who had earlier sexually assaulted her. This identification occurred in daylight. Defence counsel suggested that there was a possibility that when the complainant chose the photograph of the Appellant from those that were shown to her, what she was in fact doing was identifying the person she saw in the street, rather than the person who was sexually assaulting her. In the course of his reasons for refusing the application, the learned trial Judge stated his intention to direct the jury with respect to the displacement effect, and to give other directions to the jury concerning the need for special caution in considering the identification evidence. His Honour stated (Judgment, page 3): 
     
      
       
        
        “Thus, although the displacement effect is a matter which does reduce the probative value of the evidence, it is not a matter which causes unfair prejudice to the extent that the evidence should be excluded. As I have attempted to suggest, the displacement effect can be easily explained to jurors who will then understand how it affects the probative value of the photographic identification.” 
        
       
      
    60 His Honour foreshadowed giving the jury appropriate directions concerning the fact that the Appellant was the only person in the photograph array with dreadlocks and also concerning the “rogue’s gallery effect” (T3-4, 11 September 2006). In circumstances where such directions were to be given to the jury, his Honour concluded that he was not satisfied that the probative value of the photographic identification evidence was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Appellant. 
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    61 Mr Brady refers to R v Blick (2000) 111 A Crim R 326 at 334-335 [25]-[29] in support of the submission that the photographic identification evidence ought to have been excluded. The Crown submitted that the issue for the trial Judge was whether the asserted frailties in the photographic identification evidence could be overcome by appropriate directions, and that his Honour correctly resolved that there was no basis to withdraw the evidence and that appropriately crafted directions would ensure that the jury did not use the identification evidence in an impermissible way. 
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    62 Although the application to withdraw the evidence was made belatedly, it remained open to the trial Judge to withdraw the evidence from the jury if a proper basis was demonstrated for such a course of action: R v Tugaga (1994) 74 A Crim R 190 at 193-194; R v Howard (2005) 152 A Crim R 7 at 15 [36]. 
     
      
    63 It has been observed that the mandatory terms of s.137 Evidence Act 1995 are more consistent with an evaluative judgment, dependant upon a connected series of findings of law and of fact, rather than the exercise of a judicial discretion: R v Sood [2007] NSWCCA 214 at [23]. The Appellant does not submit that his Honour applied an incorrect principle or principles in his determination of this issue. Rather, the challenge on appeal is to the decision made on the application.  
     
      
    64 Evidence is not unfairly prejudicial merely because it makes it more likely that an accused will be convicted: Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 at 325 [91]-[92]. There must be a real risk that the evidence will be misused by the jury in some way and that that risk will exist notwithstanding the proper directions which it should be assumed the Court will give: R v Shamouil (2006) 66 NSWLR 228 at 239 [72].  
     
      
    65 No error has been demonstrated in his Honour’s decision not to withdraw the picture identification evidence from the jury. His Honour outlined directions which he proposed to give to the jury, and which were ultimately given to the jury. His Honour’s conclusion that the probative value of the picture identification evidence was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the Appellant was open to his Honour and no error has been demonstrated in his Honour’s refusal to withdraw the evidence from the jury. 
     
      
    66 Ground 2 ought be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 – Suggested Connection Between Appellant’s Psychiatric Condition and his Moral Culpability 
       
       
      Ground 5 – Suggested Failure to Give Adequate Weight to Appellant’s Psychiatric Condition 
       
      
    67 It is appropriate to consider the grounds of appeal concerning sentence together. These grounds relate to the manner in which the learned sentencing Judge approached psychiatric evidence concerning the Appellant in passing sentence.  
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    68 Tendered in the defence case on sentence were reports of Dr Thomas Clark, psychiatrist, dated 17 March 1995 and Associate Professor Susan Hayes, psychologist, dated 16 March 1995, both of which related to sentencing of the Appellant on an earlier occasion. In addition, a report of Dr Stephen Allnutt, psychiatrist, dated 25 October 2006 was tendered in the defence case on sentence.  
     
      
    69 In his report, Dr Clark stated that the Appellant was “performing at the level of someone who was mentally retarded, although his basic IQ was probably above that”, that “he is disabled intellectually at present” and “also has a substance abuse disorder, namely alcoholism”. Associate Professor Hayes reported that the Appellant’s “testing indicates that in relation to cognitive skills he is functioning in the moderate range of intellectual disability”. Dr Allnutt referred to the Appellant’s account of “hearing voices” and expressed the opinion that the Appellant manifested symptoms consistent with depressive and psychotic symptoms and that his “functioning in my view is mildly to moderately impaired secondary to ongoing, active psychotic symptoms and mood disorder”. 
     
      
    70 Mr Brady submitted to the learned sentencing Judge (and again on appeal) that the psychiatric and psychological evidence concerning the Appellant ought be taken into account in his favour on sentence, and that a finding ought be made that his psychosis or intellectual disability contributed to his committing the present offence, a finding which it was contended ought be reached by drawing what was said to be an appropriate inference.  
     
      
    71 The Crown submitted that no error had been demonstrated in the findings and conclusions of the sentencing Judge concerning the Appellant's psychiatric condition. 
     
      
       
      Determination 
       
      
    72 His Honour referred to the psychiatric and psychological evidence at a number of points in his remarks on sentence (ROS 8-12): 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender is a person who has a number of difficulties as far as his mental abilities are concerned. He is unable to read and write and has difficulties communicating. A psychologist’s report prepared in 1995 suggests that the offender functions in the moderate range of intellectual disability. On top of that, the offender has been hearing voices for some time and is now treated whilst in custody with antipsychotic medication. These two factors suggest that when assessing the appropriate sentence to impose on the offender less emphasis should be placed on general deterrence than would otherwise be the case. They also suggest that the offender’s time in custody will be harder than if he were psychiatrically well and did not have any intellectual disability. Further, the offender has previously been assaulted whilst in gaol.  
        
       
       
        
        The fact that the offender’s time in custody will be harder than usual is a very important factor which suggests the imposition of a non-parole period less than the standard. There are, of course, other factors in this case suggesting the imposition of a non-parole period less than the standard. Those other reasons are to be found elsewhere in these remarks on sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        One of the issues raised during the hearing of the sentencing proceedings concern the relationship, if any, between the offender’s psychiatric condition and his offence. Nothing in the material presented to me suggested any connection at all. For example, there is no suggestion that the voices told him to abuse the complainant in the way he did, nor was there any evidence that because of his psychiatric condition he was less able to make appropriate decisions about his conduct that night. There seems to be no connection between the offender’s psychiatric illness and his moral culpability at all.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        It is a fundamental rule of sentencing that the sentence needs to reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct. The standard non-parole period in a case where there was not a plea of guilty can only be departed from when a judge has given specific reasons for such a departure. As I said, I am satisfied that the offence is objectively in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, but I will not impose a non-parole period as long as the standard. Primarily that is because of the offender’s mental difficulties, but the other reasons I have mentioned also in my remarks on sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        I will make a small adjustment to the relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence to make a finding of special circumstances in the offender’s favour. That small adjustment is related to the offender’s intellectual disability and problems with psychosis. But I have to recognise that I have already taken those factors into account in setting the non-parole period in the head sentence, and so to give significant weight in finding special circumstances would be to double count. I have to also - and this is perhaps the most important constraint on the non-parole period - to recognise that the non-parole period itself has to reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct.” 
        
       
      
    73 In approaching the use of psychiatric and psychological evidence on sentence, it is necessary to bear in mind the observations of Gleeson CJ in R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68 that it would be erroneous in principle to approach the law of sentencing as though automatic consequences follow from the presence or absence of particular factual circumstances.  74 The existence of a mental illness or other psychiatric condition, where causally related to the offence committed, can be relevant to the assessment of the offender’s moral culpability. Where mental illness contributes to the commission of an offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced and there may not then be the same call for denunciation and the punishment warranted may accordingly be reduced: R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23]; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]; R v Hamid (2006) 164 A Crim R 179 at 197 [94]. 
     
      
    75 The challenge contained in Ground 4 involves a challenge to a finding of fact made by the learned sentencing Judge. His Honour had regard to the psychiatric and psychological evidence and was not satisfied, in the circumstances of the present case, that any connection had been established between the Appellant’s psychiatric condition and his commission of this offence.  
     
      
    76 This Court is bound by the findings of fact of the sentencing Judge unless they were not open on the evidence or unless error is shown in accordance with the principles in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 at 504-505: R v Khouzame [2000] NSWCCA 505 at [33]-[41]; R v Merritt (2004) 59 NSWLR 557 at 573 [61]. There was, of course, a practical difficulty facing the Appellant given his denial of the commission of the offence in advancing a submission that his mental state had, in some way, contributed to the commission of the offence. Nevertheless, his Honour considered the submission on its merits and rejected it. There was no direct evidence before the sentencing Judge as to whether any condition from which the Appellant suffered was causally related to the commission of the offence. Nor was his Honour required to draw an inference favourable to the Appellant on this issue.  
     
      
    77 No error has been demonstrated in his Honour’s finding that no connection had been demonstrated between the Appellant’s psychiatric condition and his commission of this offence and thus his moral culpability for the offence. I would reject Ground 4. 
     
      
    78 With respect to Ground 5, it is apparent that his Honour gave careful consideration to the psychiatric and psychological evidence for the purpose of determining sentence. His Honour had regard to that evidence, in the Appellant’s favour, both in fixing the non-parole period and in finding special circumstances.  
     
      
    79 In my view, it has not been demonstrated that his Honour erred in failing to give adequate weight on sentence to the Appellant’s psychiatric condition. To the contrary, his Honour took these matters into account in the exercise of sentencing discretion for a most serious crime for which the Appellant was to be sentenced. I would reject Ground 5. 
     
      
    80 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (a) appeal against conviction dismissed; 
       
       
      (b) grant leave to appeal against sentence, but appeal dismissed. 
       
      
    81 HALL J: I agree with Johnson J.

     Robert LEE v Regina 
      
     Acura NIUQILA v Regina 
      
      
     Headnote 
    On 22 June 2006, Robert Lee, George Tuifua and Acura Niuqila each pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit armed robbery. The relevant substantive offence is armed robbery with an offensive weapon: s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for a term of 20 years.  Norrish DCJ imposed the following sentences: i) Lee - a total sentence of 6 years 9 months, comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months, with a balance of term of 3 years; ii) Tuifua - a total sentence of 6 years 9 months, comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 10 months, with a balance of term of 2 years 11 months; and iii) Niuquila - a total sentence of 7 years 6 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years 9 months, with a balance of term of 2 years 9 months. There were three other co-offenders, Sinamoni, Dodds, and Robinson, who pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial. A jury found them guilty. Tupman DCJ sentenced Sinamoni and Dodds to a total sentence of 8 years, comprising a non-parole period of 5 years and a balance of term of 3 years. Robinson’s matter was stood over and is not relevant to this appeal. The applicants appeal against sentence on the basis that they have a legitimate sense of grievance as to the sentences imposed on them, as compared with the sentences imposed on Sinamoni and Dodds.Per Beazley JA (Grove and Hidden JJ) agreeingDid the applicants have a legitimate sense of grievance? 
     
      
       
      1) Disparity in the sentencing of co-offenders engenders a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant and an appearance of injustice to the community, such that appellate intervention is called for, notwithstanding any correct application of principle on part of the sentencing judge: [22]-[24]. 
       
        
       
        
        Lowe v R  
        [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 (applied);  
        Postiglione v R 
         [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 (applied) 
        
       
        
       
      2) The applicants would each have a justifiable sense of grievance, having regard to the sentences imposed on their co-offenders: [41]. 
      
       
      
     Did his Honour otherwise err in the sentencing process? 
      
       
      
      3) When sentencing a common law offence, the proper approach is to have regard to the maximum penalty prescribed for the corresponding substantive offence: [2] 
       
       
        
        R v Hoar 
         [1981] HCA 67; (1981) 148 CLR 32 (referred to);  
        R v VAA 
         [2006] NSWCCA 44 (referred to). 
        
       
       
      4) Norrish DCJ had regard to the sentencing guideline judgment of  
      R v Henry 
       [1999] NSWCCA 111, and range of sentences that should be imposed in respect of the corresponding substantive offence under s 97(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900: [17]-[19] 
       
       
        
        R v Henry 
         [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; 106 A Crim R 149 (considered) 
        
       
      
      
     
      
      5) The sentences imposed by Norrish DCJ were not manifestly excessive: [41], [44]. 
       
        
       
      6) The sentences imposed on the co-offenders by Tupman DCJ were not so lenient that to reduce the sentences imposed upon the applicants would itself be “ 
      an affront to the proper administration of justice 
      ”: [42]

      7) The applicants are re-sentenced, the notional starting point for each offender being reduced to 8 years, to be increased or decreased for the individual applicants, having regard to their particular circumstances: [43].

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: On 22 June 2006, Robert Lee, George Tuifua and Acura Niuqila each pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit armed robbery. Each was committed for sentence to the District Court. On 30 January 2007, they came before his Honour Judge Norrish QC in the District Court for sentence.  
     
      
    2 The charge against each of the co-accused was that between 28 June 2005 and 2 July 2005, they had conspired between themselves and others to commit an offence, namely, robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. Being a common law offence, the penalty is “at large”. However, it is accepted that the proper approach to sentence on such a charge is to have regard to the maximum penalty prescribed for the corresponding substantive offence: see R v Hoar [1981] HCA 67; (1981) 148 CLR 32 at [21]; R v VAA [2006] NSWCCA 44 at [5]. The relevant substantive offence is armed robbery with an offensive weapon: s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for a term of 20 years.  
     
      
    3 The sentences that his Honour imposed for the conspiracy offence were: 
     
      
       
      Lee: a total sentence of 6 years 9 months, comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months, with a balance of term of 3 years; 
       
       
      Tuifua: a total sentence of 6 years 9 months, comprising a non-parole period of 3 years 10 months, with a balance of term of 2 years 11 months; and  
       
       
      Niuqila: a total sentence of 7 years 6 months, with a non-parole period of 4 years 9 months, with a balance of term of 2 years 9 months. 
       
      
    4 In each case, his Honour allowed a discount of 25 per cent for the utility of the early pleas that had been entered. 
     
      
    5 Lee and Niuqila also had further offences taken into account in the sentencing process pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. Lee was sentenced for 6 months for the offence of being carried in a conveyance contrary to s 154A of the Crimes Act, to be served concurrently with the sentence on the conspiracy charge. Niuqila was sentenced for 6 months for the offence of driving whilst disqualified contrary to s 25A(1)(a) of the Road Transport (Driver Licensing) Act 1998. That sentence was to be served concurrently with the conspiracy offence. 
     
      
    6 There were three other co-offenders, Sinamoni, Dodds, and Robinson. Those offenders pleaded not guilty and proceeded to trial.  
     
      
    7 On 21 December 2006, after a five week trial, a jury returned a verdict of guilty against each of Sinamoni and Dodds on the charge that between 6 May and 2 July 2005 they conspired amongst themselves and others to commit a robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. Robinson was also found guilty of that offence, but a question arose as to whether he was unfit to plead at the time of his trial. 
     
      
    8 Sinamoni and Dodds were sentenced by her Honour Tupman DCJ on 15 June 2007. They were each sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years with a balance of term of 3 years, giving an overall term of imprisonment of 8 years. 
     
      
    9 The applicants appeal against sentence essentially on the basis that they have a legitimate sense of grievance as to the sentences imposed on them, as compared with the sentences imposed on Sinamoni and Dodds.  
     
      
    10 The matter proceeded before the sentencing judge on the following Agreed Facts. Prior to being arrested for the conspiracy offence, the applicants and their co-accused were under police surveillance. Authorised telephone intercepts revealed that they were about to commit an armed robbery on the Commonwealth Bank of Australia at Seven Hills on the morning of 1 July 2005. The intercepted material demonstrated that Tuifua was involved in organising the equipment for the proposed robbery, including a firearm and ammunition, a stolen vehicle, sledgehammers, radios and clothing intended to disguise the offenders’ identity. In the 48 hour period leading up to 1 July, all of the accused were involved in further preparatory acts.  
     
      
    11 It had originally been planned to commit the armed robbery on the morning of 30 June. However, there was a delay in obtaining some of the items required for use in the offence and the proposal to carry out the robbery was postponed until the following day.  
     
      
    12 Lee agreed that on the morning of 30 June, he and Niuqila had obtained a shortened double-barrel shotgun. Niuqila did not agree that he had been instrumental in obtaining the shotgun. Rather, he contended that his role had been to drive Lee to Guilford, where Lee had obtained the shortened double-barrel shotgun. 
     
      
    13 During the course of 30 June 2005, the six co-accused met and arranged the firearm, vehicles, radios, phones, clothing and disguises for use in the commission of the robbery. At about 9 am on 1 July, they left Sinamoni’s Blacktown residence and travelled to Seven Hills in three vehicles, a stolen Porsche Four Wheel Drive, a blue Ford Laser Sedan owned by Robinson and a Red Toyota Corolla, of which Niuqila was then custodian. The shotgun was transferred to the Porsche in a carpark about a kilometre from the Commonwealth Bank at Seven Hills. Sinamoni then drove the Porsche in the direction of the bank. Lee was a passenger in that vehicle. The accused were under police surveillance and at about 9.20 am, Sinamoni and Lee fled in the Porsche, the police having unsuccessfully attempted to arrest them. They were arrested shortly afterwards. At about the same time, Niuqila and Tuifua were observed by Police driving through a nearby carpark in the Corolla and were also arrested a short time thereafter. On a search of the Corolla, gloves, a balaclava and other clothing for the purpose of a disguise were found. Robinson and Dodds left the area in the Laser, but were arrested on 8 July.  
     
      
    14 Surveillance footage had been taken by the police on the morning of 1 July 2005 in the vicinity of Sinamoni’s residence. That footage disclosed the six co-accused standing next to the Corolla and Laser and then getting into the vehicles, which were seen driving to the end of the street. Shortly afterwards, the stolen Porsche was depicted driving in the opposite direction along the street and the Corolla and Laser were seen to complete a U-turn and follow the Porsche.  
     
      
       
      Sentencing of the applicants 
       
      
    15 Norrish DCJ sentenced the applicants on the basis that they were equally culpable for the offence, notwithstanding some differences in the roles each played. As his Honour did not have any information as to the role of the co-offenders Sinamoni, Dodds and Robinson other than the bare facts alleged in the indictment, he was unable to compare the roles of the applicants to those co-offenders.  
     
      
    16 His Honour considered that the proposed crime was serious. He observed that it was well accepted that planned armed robberies of financial institutions have always been regarded as a more serious type of armed robbery. He rejected a submission that Lee played a lesser role in the conspiracy. He considered that Lee participated in the planning of the proposed armed robbery. His Honour found that Lee proposed to participate in the raid upon the bank. Notwithstanding the planning that had gone into the intended robbery, his Honour refused to draw the conclusion, urged upon him by the Crown, that the offence was part of “organised criminal activity” or “syndicate type behaviour”. Rather, he considered that this association was through common social interests. His Honour considered that the motivation of the offenders was to obtain money.  
     
      
    17 Norrish DCJ observed that he was required to have regard to the guideline judgment of R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346; 106 A Crim R 149. In Henry, Spigelman CJ indicated the range of sentences that should be imposed in respect of an offence under s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, being the offence of robbery whilst armed with an offensive weapon. As I have already observed, s 97(1) is the relevant substantive offence to the conspiracy offence with which the applicants were charged. The Chief Justice stated, at [162]-[165], that a sentence of 4 to 5 years was appropriate in circumstances where the following factors were involved: (i) a young offender with no or little criminal history; (ii) a weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury; (iii) a limited degree of planning; (iv) limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof; (v) a victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver; (vi) a small amount taken in the robbery; and (vii) a plea of guilty, the significance of which was limited by a strong Crown case.  
     
      
    18 The applicants in this case fell outside that ‘profile’ in significant respects. Although each was relatively young, each had a serious criminal history; Niuqila was on parole, Tuifua was on a bond and on bail and Lee was on bail at the time of the offence; there was a significant degree of planning; and the likelihood the proceeds of the robbery would have been substantial was high. However, whilst the plea of guilty was entered in the face of a strong Crown case, its utility was substantial having regard to the early stage at which each of the pleas was entered. Norrish DCJ also observed that although there was evidence of drug usage and alcohol abuse, there was no suggestion that the offence was motivated by drug or alcohol addiction, although that was a factor relevant to explaining the behaviour of the applicants.  
     
      
    19 His Honour, after having noted that there were a number of significant differences between the sentencing of the applicants and the matters adverted to in Henry, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “… clearly a starting point for any sentence for this matter must be well above that of the guideline …”  
        
       
       
      Comparison of sentences 
       
      
    20 Sinamoni and Dodds were each given a total effective sentence of 8 years. This is to be compared with the ‘starting point’ for the sentences imposed on Niuqila, Lee and Tuifua, prior to the application of a discount for the pleas of guilty. In Niuqila’s case, the starting point was 10 years and in the case of Lee and Tuifua, it was 9 years. Ms Loukas, counsel for Niuqila, provided a helpful table setting out the sentences, the records of the offenders and a brief synopsis of the comments of the sentencing judge in each case. It is set out below, as it provides a focus for my observations which follow. (The references to “D & A” are references to drug and alcohol problems, “LC” is the Local Court and “NG” refers to a plea of not guilty.)

    21 The critical question in this case is whether, as a result of the approach adopted by Tupman DCJ, the applicants before this Court, Tuifua, Lee and Niuqila, have a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity between the sentences imposed on each and those imposed upon Sinamoni and Dodds.  
     
      
    22 The principles which govern this ground of appeal are well established. Appellate intervention is called for, not because of error on the part of the sentencing judge, but because:  
     
      
       
        
        “… disparity engenders a justifiable sense of grievance in the applicant and an appearance of injustice to that impassive representative of the community, the objective bystander”:  
        Lowe v R  
        [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606 per Mason J at 613. 
        
       
      
    23 Mason J had earlier in his judgment commented, at 611, that unequal treatment under the law would lead to “an erosion of public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice”. Dawson J, at 623, observed to similar effect, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… justice should be even-handed and … any difference between the sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence ought not be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the offender with the heavier sentence or to give the appearance that justice has not been done.” 
        
       
      
    24 In Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295, these principles were endorsed, but, relevantly, Dawson and Gaudron JJ also commented, at 301: 
     
      
       
        
        “Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them.” 
        
       
       
      Sentencing remarks of Tupman DCJ in respect of Sinamoni and Dodds 
       
      
    25 Her Honour, Tupman DCJ, categorised the conspiracy as relatively serious, although not at the top of the range. Her Honour referred to the plan to use a sawn-off loaded shotgun, the planning over a period of about six weeks, including the planning to steal a car and the organisation of disguises and the like. Nonetheless, her Honour considered that it was not a “well-crafted plan to commit the bank robbery”. Her Honour observed there was no evidence to suggest what was to happen after the robbery was committed, for example, where they should meet up, how much was expected to be gained and the like. Her Honour noted there was no evidence of “casing out” the bank and no evidence of the particular roles each of the conspirators would take during the course of the robbery, apart from Sinamoni and Lee.  
     
      
    26 Her Honour considered that as the robbery was timed to occur at opening time, although staff would be present, there possibly would be fewer customers present than at other times during the day. The bank was also located in an industrial area, so there was little passing pedestrian traffic which, although perhaps making it easier to commit the robbery and get away quickly, was likely to have meant less chance of the involvement of members of the public. Her Honour concluded the offence was in about the middle of the range in terms of its objective seriousness, when compared with “an armed robbery simpliciter”. Her Honour considered it was made somewhat more serious because it was planned and because the offender had obtained the shortened firearm. She noted, however, that care had to be taken in respect of giving consideration to obtaining the firearm, as the charge was not a conspiracy to commit an aggravated robbery with a dangerous weapon. Her Honour considered the offence was made “somewhat less serious” for the very reason that it did not happen.  
     
      
    27 Tupman DCJ next referred to Henry. Her Honour considered the sentences she would impose needed to be above the range referred to in that case, because Sinamoni and Dodds each had relatively extensive criminal records, there had not been a plea of guilty, nor were either of them addicted to drugs or alcohol, meaning that was not a reason for the commission of the offence. Having decided the sentence to be imposed needed to be more than the 4 to 5 years referred to in Henry, her Honour stated that the question she had to decide was “how much more?”. Her Honour then went through the circumstances of each of the offenders before her. 
     
      
    28 Her Honour considered the question of parity, not only as between Sinamoni and Dodds, but also with respect to the applicants in this case. Her Honour noted that Norrish DCJ had expressed the same view as she had, that this was a worse situation than Henry. Tupman DCJ noted his Honour’s remark that the appropriate sentencing starting point should be above the 4 to 5 years referred to in Henry and then noted that his Honour had “picked a starting point … which was either double or just below double the guideline referred to in Henry’s case”. Her Honour stated that Norrish DCJ had given no reasons for having made that choice. Her Honour noted that Norrish DCJ had given a full 25 per cent for a plea of guilty from that notional starting point, which, she said, “does not appear to take into account the fact that a Henry guideline-based sentence already has a plea of guilty factored into it”.  
     
      
    29 Next, her Honour referred to the judgment of this Court in Qing An v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 53. Her Honour noted that was a case where there had been multiple armed robberies contrary to s 97(1) and referred to [105] of my judgment in that case (with which Hislop J agreed), where I stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “I consider sentences of 8 and 9 years to be outside the available discretionary range. However, I am of the opinion that some regard should be had to the acceleration in the appellant’s offending over the short period involved and that should be reflected in the sentence imposed for the last offence.” 
        
       
      
    30 Her Honour appears to have understood that finding to have been made in the context of what the appropriate individual sentences ought to be in the light of the Henry guideline. Her Honour observed the Court had found the sentences were manifestly excessive and also noted the sentences imposed of 8 to 9 years were after a trial, and that although the offences did not involve bank robberies, were armed robberies involving a knife. Her Honour also noted that the offence with which she was concerned was factually “a little more serious than any one of the individual offences” before the Court in Qing An.  
     
      
    31 Her Honour also had regard to the Judicial Commission’s statistics and noted that sentences of 8 to 9 years were at the very top of the range for offences of armed robbery. Her Honour considered the offence before her was not at the very top of the range of seriousness, but rather, was about the middle of the range. She considered that Norrish DCJ had similarly characterised the offence. Her Honour repeated that Norrish DCJ had provided no reasons or explanation for deciding that a starting point of 9 or 10 years was appropriate. Her Honour said that because of that, and taking into account the authorities, particularly that of Qing An, and the Judicial Commission’s statistics, she considered that Norrish DCJ fell into  
     
      
       
        
        “… appellable error in sentencing Niuqila, Lee and Tuifua, based on a starting point of nine or ten years in the way that he did and providing no reason for doing so.”  
        
       
       
      She considered his Honour’s ‘starting points’ were manifestly excessive. For those reasons, her Honour considered she was not bound to sentence Sinamoni and Dodds on the basis of parity with the sentences imposed on the applicants.  
       
      
    32 With respect to her Honour, it was not for her to find appealable error in the approach of Norrish DCJ. Rather, her Honour’s task was to determine the sentences that should be imposed upon the accused before her, having regard to all of the circumstances. In doing so, it was incumbent upon her Honour to have regard to the sentences that had been imposed on the applicants in this case, they being the co-accused of the parties before her. It was for her Honour to sentence the accused persons before her, having regard to their relevant circumstances.  
     
      
    33 In sentencing the offenders before her, her Honour was entitled to have regard to relevant Judicial Commission statistics, recognising that those statistics have to be approached with care. The use and utility of such statistical information was discussed by Spigelman CJ in R v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734 at 738-9; (1998) 101 A Crim R 404. See also Regina v AEM Snr; Regina v KEM; Regina v MM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [113] ff. 
     
      
    34 It was also appropriate for her Honour to have regard to other relevant authorities: R v Bloomfield at 739. However, it appears that her Honour may have misunderstood the comment at [105] in Qing An. Her Honour appears to have treated that remark as being indicative of an appropriate range for offences under s 97(1). That is not so. The reasons why the sentences of 8 and 9 years were regarded to be outside the available discretionary range in that case is clearly explained in the preceding paragraphs. In the 8 offences of which the appellant was found guilty in that case, there was mostly one victim and the proceeds of the robberies were, in relative terms, small, involving mobile phones, jewellery and some cash, in amounts varying between $15 and $1,600.  
     
      
    35 The point of the comment at [105] was made having regard to the objective seriousness of the offences in that case. There was also little difference in the seriousness of the individual offences committed by Qing An. The trial judge had sentenced Qing An on the first count to 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months. That was accepted by this Court to be within a range of sentences that could have been appropriately imposed. His Honour then increased the sentences incrementally, ultimately imposing sentences of 8 and 9 years for the last of the offences, which were of approximately equal seriousness to the first. The Court considered there was no reasonable basis for that differentiation.  
     
      
    36 In re-sentencing, I considered that a heavier sentence should be imposed in respect of at least one offence to take account of Qing An’s accelerating offending. Otherwise, the appropriate sentence for each offence was that imposed on the first count. Having regard to all the circumstances in that case, there was no warrant to impose a sentence of 8 or 9 years, even to take account of that last factor. There were also important and difficult considerations of totality in Qing An that needed to be taken into account. Hislop J agreed with this approach. 
     
      
    37 The most severe sentence imposed in Qing An was 7 years. Tupman DCJ recognised that the offences in Qing An were not as serious as the offence here. As has already been stated, she imposed a sentence of 8 years on each offender. However, not only were the offences not as serious, the individual offences in Qing An bore no comparability to the seriousness of the offence in this case. Her Honour’s reliance on it for some sort of benchmark or some statement of principle was, with respect, misconceived.  
     
      
    38 I am also of the opinion that, contrary to her Honour’s view, Norrish DCJ’s reasons for the starting point of the sentences he imposed in each case is apparent. I also do not understand her Honour’s comment to the effect that Norrish DCJ did not seem to appreciate that the range of sentences referred to in Henry had already taken into account the plea of guilty. There is nothing in his Honour’s remarks that would indicate that he did not have this understanding.  
     
      
    39 However, this is not an appeal from the sentences imposed by her Honour Tupman DCJ. The question for consideration here is, having regard to the sentences imposed by her Honour, whether the applicants have a justifiable sense of grievance in accordance with the principle articulated in Lowe and Postiglione. This question arises notwithstanding the criticisms I have made of the approach taken by Tupman DCJ.  
     
      
    40 In my opinion, the applicants would each have a justifiable sense of grievance in being sentenced to terms of imprisonment which are effectively more severe than those imposed on Sinamoni and Dodds. Both Norrish DCJ and Tupman DCJ treated the offenders as being equally culpable for the offence. That required, in accordance with principle, that they be sentenced equally, subject only to the need to take into account mitigating and aggravating factors relevant to the individual offender. The effect of the approach taken by Tupman DCJ means that the applicants were not treated equally. Subject to their individual circumstances, Sinamoni and Dodds were treated more leniently than were the applicants here, notwithstanding the absence of any factor differentiating the seriousness of their offending from the offending of the applicants.  
     
      
    41 Contrary to her Honour’s opinion, I do not consider that the sentences imposed by Norrish DCJ were manifestly excessive. Indeed, I do not consider that they could be considered harsh. Nonetheless, as I have explained, I consider that the applicants would each have a justifiable sense of grievance, having regard to the sentences imposed by Tupman DCJ.  
     
      
    42 This is not a case where it could be said the sentences imposed by Tupman DCJ, which although lenient, were so lenient that to reduce the sentences imposed upon the applicants would itself be “an affront to the proper administration of justice”: see R v Draper (NSWCCA, Street CJ, Hunt and Wood JJ, 12 December 1986, unreported) at 5; R v Diamond (NSWCCA, Hunt CJ at CL, Smart and James JJ, 18 February 1993, unreported) per Hunt CJ at CL at 5-6; R v Chen [2002] NSWCCA 174; (2002) 130 A Crim R 300 at [289] per Heydon JA, Sully and Levine JJ; R v Salcedo [2004] NSWCCA 430 at [51], [54] and [65] per McColl JA, Levine and Hidden JJ agreeing.  
     
      
    43 In my opinion, it will be appropriate that the notional starting point for each offender should be reduced to 8 years. Regard will then need to be had as to whether that should be increased or decreased for any of the individual applicants, having regard to their particular circumstances. I should point out, however, that except for matters that I specifically comment upon, the applicants did not contend that his Honour failed to take into account any relevant mitigating factor, or wrongly took into account any aggravating factor. Accordingly, subject to those specific matters, I do not propose to reiterate what his Honour said in respect of the individual circumstances of each, but adopt his Honour’s remarks and endorse the relevance he placed upon such factors. I also adopt and endorse his Honour’s findings of special circumstances and his reasons for so finding.  
     
      
       
      Appeal by Tuifua 
       
      
    44 The applicant, George Tuifua, raised two grounds of appeal. The first was parity and the second was that the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. Tuifua submitted that even if his sentence was to be reduced so as to take account of the principles of parity, his sentence should not be as severe as the sentences imposed upon Sinamoni and Dodds. He pointed out that he was significantly younger, at 19 years of age, than Sinamoni, who was 25, and Dodds, who was 23, at the time of the offence. Sinamoni and Dodds each had serious criminal records (set out in the table above) and each had already been subjected to periods of imprisonment. Tuifua, whilst having two robbery offences on his juvenile record and had breached a good behaviour bond by the commission of this offence, had never been imprisoned before. He had also expressed remorse, as was accepted by the trial judge. There was no evidence of remorse in the case of either Sinamoni or Dodds. In my opinion, these are relevant matters. However, his Honour had regard to Tuifua’s expressions of remorse, although he noted that Tuifua had not given sworn evidence to that effect. His Honour was also cognisant of Tuifua’s criminal history. I am not persuaded of any error on his Honour’s part in respect of these matters. 
     
      
       
      Appeal by Lee 
       
      
    45 The applicant, Robert Lee, had one ground of appeal, namely, that he had a justifiable sense of grievance, in the light of the sentence imposed on his co-offenders. The bases upon which he sought to establish that sense of grievance were threefold. First, he advanced the parity ground to which I have already referred. Secondly, he relied upon the significantly more serious criminal records of his co-offenders, particularly, Niuqila and Sinamoni. Thirdly, he complained that the sentences imposed on him represented an almost total accumulation of the sentence he was then serving. This was to be contrasted with the manner in which the sentences had been imposed in respect of Sinamoni and Niuqila, where, although each had parole periods of over 2 years revoked, the sentences imposed reflected an accumulation of only 6 months on that revocation.  
     
      
    46 At the time of the commission of the offence subject of this application, Lee was also on bail in respect of a charge of supply cannabis. He had earlier been on a s 9 bond in respect of a conviction for possession and use of a prohibited weapon. Although the evidence is not clear, it is probable that the bond expired on 30 May 2005. By the time he came to be sentenced in this matter, he had already been sentenced for the supply offence and had served a period of imprisonment, consisting of an aggregate term of 9 months commencing on 12 September 2005 and expiring on 11 June 2006, with an aggregate non-parole period of 6 months 25 days commencing on 12 September 2005 and expiring on 5 April 2006. Accordingly, just over 6 months of the period that Lee was in pre-trial custody for this offence had been served in respect of the non-parole period for the supply offence. 
     
      
    47 His Honour Norrish DCJ ordered the sentences that he imposed commence on 1 January 2006. The effect of this was that all but the first 3.5 months of the sentence for the supply offence were subsumed into the sentences for the present offences. This constituted an effective accumulation on the pre-existing sentence of some 3.5 months. Lee complains that this is another way in which he was treated unequally when regard is had to the manner in which the sentences were imposed on Sinamoni and Niuqila.  
     
      
    48 Sinamoni was on parole for offences of discharging a firearm in a public place and two counts of malicious wounding. He had been released to parole in March 2005, the period of parole being 2 years 6 months. Following his arrest, his parole was revoked and he was sentenced to the balance of parole backdated to 1 July 2005. His sentence for the earlier offences then expired on 16 April 2007. Tupman DCJ commenced Sinamoni’s sentence for the conspiracy charge on 1 January 2006, 6 months from the time he started serving the balance of his term of imprisonment for the earlier offences. 
     
      
    49 Niuqila was on parole for the offence of being armed with intent to commit an armed robbery on a bank. His parole was revoked upon his arrest for this offence on 1 July 2005 and he commenced serving the remaining period of his sentence for the earlier offence on that day. That sentence expired on 2 September 2006. Niuqila was also on parole for the offence of aggravated break enter and steal in company, in respect of which he was subject to a parole period of 2 years 4 months 3 weeks at the time of the commission of the conspiracy offence. Niuqila’s sentence for the conspiracy offence was ordered to commence on 1 January 2006, 6 months after he was arrested and taken into custody. His Honour observed that this was 8-9 months before the expiration of his parole period in respect of the first series of offences referred to above. 
     
      
    50 His Honour had earlier referred to the aggravated break enter and steal offence, but questioned whether the details he had of the sentence imposed for that offence were correct. There is also no reference to parole being revoked in respect of that offence. 
     
      
    51 Both Norrish DCJ, in the case of Niuqila, and Tupman DCJ in the case of Sinamoni, expressly declined to commence the sentence for this offence at the conclusion of the sentence they were each then serving pursuant to the revocation of their respective periods of parole.  
     
      
    52 The Crown acknowledges that although the accumulation on the balance of the parole sentences in the case of Niuqila and Sinamoni was only 6 months, this was necessary to avoid double counting. Norrish DCJ had specific regard to that, when sentencing Niuqila. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was submitted that I should commence the sentence that I impose from the date the offender came into custody. I have considered what Justice Simpson has said about the discretion that exists in relation to the backdating of sentences where there is a revocation of parole. I have to be very careful in light of the aggravating factor of committing this offence while subject to conditional liberty that I do not double-dip. That I do not, in effect, double punish the offender, having regard to that factor being taken into account. This case is not like the decision of  
        Johnson 
         of the Court of Criminal Appeal where an offender was sentenced after a non-parole period had expired but before the offender had been released to parole. There the Court determined that the appropriate sentence should commence from the expiration of the then existing non-parole period. I do not believe, however, this sentence should commence at the expiration of the parole period, that would be quite unfair, and would involve double penalty for the offender.”  
        
       
      
    53 In my opinion, no error has been shown in this aspect of the sentencing process and I would not make any change to the sentence in that respect. 
     
      
       
      Appeal by Niuqila 
       
      
    54 The applicant, Acura Niuqila, advanced one ground of appeal only, that as a result of the disparity between the his sentence and that of Sinamoni and Dodds, some lesser sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3). I have already dealt with Niuqila’s request to the Court, if he is to be re-sentenced, to consider the information in an affidavit declared and affirmed on 19 June 2008 in respect of his period of good behaviour in gaol. That will also be taken into account on the re-sentencing. 
     
      
       
      Orders  
       
       
      In respect of each applicant: 
       
       
      1. Grant leave to appeal against sentence; 
       
       
      2. Appeal allowed and sentences imposed by Norrish DCJ in the District Court be quashed;

    55 GROVE J: I agree with Beazley JA. 
     
      
    56 HIDDEN J: I agree with Beazley JA.57 THE COURT: Since delivery of reasons in this matter, the Court's attention has been drawn to a discrepancy in the sentence commencement date imposed on the applicant Lee and a sentence imposed by the District Court on 14 April 2008.58 Pursuant to s 59 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the Court varies the commencement date of the sentence imposed on 14 April 2008 by the District Court of New South Wales, so that the sentence and the non-parole period are each to commence on 1 February 2009 in lieu of 1 September 2009.

     R v KATON, James Rodney 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This is a Crown appeal. The respondent was convicted of three counts of sexual intercourse with a child under 16, two counts of committing an act of indecency on a child under 16, two counts of possession of child pornography and two counts of using a child for pornographic purposes. There were five matters on a Form 1. The offences involved three victims: WC, DD, and LT. 
     
      
    2 The sentencing judge imposed sentences in relation to each offence. Some sentences were made concurrent and some partly concurrent. The overall sentence was 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years. 
     
      
    3 The Crown contends that the sentences imposed are manifestly inadequate. The fundamental issue is that by providing for a number of the sentences to be served concurrently the sentencing judge failed to impose a sentence which is sufficient punishment for the number and seriousness of the offences involved. 
     
      
       
      The charges 
       
       
      Count 1 Act of indecency with person under 16 years, namely 13 years: section 61N(1)  
      Crimes Act  
      1900; maximum penalty imprisonment for 2 years [victim – WC]. 
       
       
      Count 2 Sexual intercourse with a person under 16 years, namely 13 years: section 66C(1)  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 [since amended]: maximum penalty penal servitude for 8 years. [victim – WC]. 
       
       
      Count 3 Sexual intercourse with person under 16 years, namely 14 years: section 66C(1)  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 [since amended]: maximum penalty penal servitude for 8 years [victim – WC]. 
       
       
      Counts 4 and 5 Possess child pornography: section 91H(3)  
      Crimes Act  
      1900: maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years. 
       
       
      Count 6 Use child under 18 years, namely 14 years, for pornographic purposes: section 91G(1)(a)  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 [since amended] maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years [victim – DD]. 
       
       
      Count 7 Act of indecency with person under 16 years, namely 15 years: section 61N(1)  
      Crimes Act  
      1900: maximum penalty imprisonment for 2 years [victim – LT]. 
       
       
      Count 8 Use child under 18 years, namely 15 years, for pornographic purposes. Section 91G(1)(a)  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 [since amended]: maximum penalty imprisonment for 5 years [victim – LT]. 
       
       
      Count 9 Sexual intercourse with person between 14 and 16 years, namely 15 years: Section 66C(3)  
      Crimes Act  
      1900: maximum penalty imprisonment for 10 years [victim – LT]. 
       
      
    4 The respondent also asked that five matters be taken into account on a Form 1 in relation to count 9. They were three counts of an act of indecency with a person under 16 years (s 61N(1) Crimes Act 1900), one count of goods in custody (s 527C(1)(c) Crimes Act 1900) and one count of possess ammunition without a licence (s 65(3) Firearms Act 1996). One of the acts of indecency was committed on WC in 1998 and two of the acts of indecency were committed on LT in 2004. 
     
      
    5 No standard non-parole periods apply to the offences. 
     
      
    6 The offences occurred between September 1998 and February 2007. The sentencing judge observed that for some offences the maximum penalties when they were committed were less than is now provided by the relevant legislation. The sentencing judge determined that the respondent should be sentenced in accordance with the maximum penalties relevant at the time of the offence and in accordance with the sentencing principles which existed at that time. However, it is apparent in her remarks on sentence that her Honour erroneously identified the maximum penalty for count 9 as being 8 years imprisonment rather than 10 years. 
     
      
       
      The sentence 
       
       
      The respondent was sentenced as follows: 
       
       
      Count 1 Imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year commencing 2 March 2007 and expiring 1 March 2008. 
       
       
      Count 2 Imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years commencing 2 March 2007 and expiring 1 March 2009. 
       
       
      Count 3 Imprisonment for 3 years 4 months and 2 weeks, commencing 2 March 2007 and expiring 15 July 2010, with a non-parole period of 2 years expiring 1 March 2009. 
       
       
      Counts 4 and 5 Imprisonment for 2 years 3 months commencing 2 September 2007 and expiring 1 December 2009, with a non-parole period of 18 months expiring 1 March 2009. 
       
       
      Count 6 Imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year commencing 2 September 2007 and expiring 1 September 2008. 
       
       
      Count 7 Imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year commencing 2 March 2008 and expiring 1 March 2009. 
       
       
      Count 8 Imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months commencing 2 March 2008 and expiring 1 September 2009. 
       
       
      Count 9 Taking into account the Form 1 matters, imprisonment for 4 years commencing 2 March 2008 and expiring 1 March 2012, with a non-parole period of 2 years expiring 1 March 2010. 
       
      
    7 Table A on Annexure “A” to these reasons illustrates the length of sentence and the extent of concurrence and accumulation. The total effective sentence was therefore 5 years, with non-parole period of 3 years. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    8 The respondent lived in a “granny flat” adjacent to his father’s residence. He first met the complainant WC in October 1998 when WC was 13 years old. WC attended the respondent’s flat having been made an offer of work doing odd jobs. He was also promised work as the respondent’s offsider when he bought a truck. After a couple of visits to the respondent’s property, the respondent told WC that he had to be at ease being naked in front of him and told WC to take his clothes off. WC did this. After a while the respondent told him he could get dressed again. 
     
      
    9 Count 1: The following day the respondent again asked WC to get undressed. This time, however, the respondent took hold of WC’s penis and held it for a while. He asked WC “is this all right?” to which WC just shrugged. After a while the respondent let go and told WC he could get dressed. 
     
      
    10 Count 2: A few days later the respondent again asked WC to get undressed and then took hold of WC’s penis. The respondent asked “can I put my mouth over it?” to which WC just shrugged. The respondent performed fellatio on WC and then after a while rubbed WC’s penis with his hand until WC ejaculated, which the respondent caught in his mouth. 
     
      
    11 Count 3: In spring 1999 WC went on an overnight fishing trip with the respondent. During the night, the respondent fondled WC’s penis before performing fellatio until WC ejaculated. 
     
      
    12 Shortly thereafter, WC confronted the respondent about the fact that the offsider position had not materialised. They argued and WC did not return again. Although WC told his girlfriend about the relevant events in 2002 and police in 2003, he did not make a formal complaint until August 2006. 
     
      
    13 Count 4: On 5 February 2007, the police executed a search warrant at the respondent’s flat. Police located eight video cassettes, which revealed images recorded in the respondent’s flat by a hidden camera, showing teenage boys and on one occasion, a pre-pubescent boy. Each would come into the room and undress until partially or fully naked, while the respondent remained clothed. Some boys only appeared once; others appeared a number of times over the course of days. After undressing, the respondent appears to ask them to do various things like running on the spot or stretching. Footage includes some boys fondling themselves or masturbating, or the respondent touching or masturbating the boys. Other footage includes the respondent performing fellatio on LT (see count 9) or making extended examinations of the boys’ genitals. Some of the boys clearly appear uncomfortable. 
     
      
    14 One of the boys in the video footage was identified as DD. DD met the respondent in 2003 when he was 13, and since that time had gone to the respondent’s house to work for him a number of times a week. DD was also promised work as the respondent’s offsider once the truck was purchased. 
     
      
    15 Count 6: In late 2004 when DD was 14 the respondent told him that if he was to be his offsider he would have to be comfortable being naked around him, and took DD to the room with the hidden camera. The respondent invited DD to remove his clothes, which he did. The respondent asked DD to sit on a chair, which resulted in DD’s genitals being in full view of the camera. He was then asked to perform a number of (non-sexual) tasks. The video runs in excess of 2 hours. 
     
      
    16 Another boy identified in the footage was LT. The respondent conducted his relationship with him in the same way as he did with WC and DD. The footage covers at least 4 separate days. The first recording shows LT undressing in front of the hidden camera and then jogging on the spot. The second recording shows the same thing, except on this occasion the respondent also fondles LT’s penis for several minutes. This matter was included on the Form 1 in relation to count 9, below. 
     
      
    17 Counts 7 and 8: The third recording shows LT undressing and lying on the floor. The respondent sits next to him and masturbates him until he is erect. He then asks LT to jog on the spot, before asking him to lie down again. He then lifts LT’s legs as if in a stretching motion, the effect of which is to expose LT’s anus directly to the camera. 
     
      
    18 Count 9 (and Form 1): There was further footage, which covered over 3 hours. LT pulls down his pants and the respondent fondles his penis. He placed his mouth over LT’s penis for a few seconds, and then laughed and moved to a position where he appeared to kiss LT. The respondent then continued to fondle LT’s penis and again placed his mouth over LT’s penis for a few seconds. He did this on a number of occasions. He also conducted similar stretching exercises as he had done previously. 
     
      
    19 The respondent was interviewed by police and indicated among other things that some of the boys on the tapes may have been 14 or 15 years old, that the recordings were for his own use and were never shown or distributed to anyone else. He said, although it is not apparent how this is the case, that the tapes were made as a means of protecting himself should these young people ever make any unsubstantiated allegations against him. 
     
      
       
      Subjective features of the respondent 
       
      
    20 The respondent is currently 45 years of age. A number of reports, and a letter written by the respondent, were tendered at the sentence hearing. As a child he suffered physical and emotional abuse at the hands of his mother and also from classmates at schools. He was sexually assaulted on a number of occasions between the age of 7 (when his parents separated) and 16. He made a number of suicide attempts and began using sedatives, alcohol and other drugs. He had only sporadic employment and was often unemployed. He had had a number of operations on his spine after a work injury, and also experienced chronic neck and back pain. He was married in his early 20s but that only lasted about a year, and he had no other successful adult relationship. He is bisexual and fantasised about both male and female adult partners. 
     
      
    21 The respondent maintained that the offences occurred when he was under the influence of amphetamines, cannabis, and prescribed medications. He expressed regret and remorse for his actions. 
     
      
    22 A psychologist’s report from Mr W John Taylor found that the respondent had a personality disorder and suffered from depression, low self-esteem, and that when engaged in substance abuse his impulse “controls would then be weakened and he would have a low threshold for hostile or erotic discharge”. Also, the respondent “is socially inhibited and is likely to distance himself from other people through fear of being harmed in some way … he is rather passive … [and] would generally find it very difficult to establish relationships which could meet those needs [for nurturance, acceptance and approval], which may result in the formation of inappropriate relationships”. Mr Taylor found that the respondent had a low to moderate risk of recidivism. 
     
      
    23 The Crown tendered a pre-sentence report, which included an interview with his parents. His father called the respondent a “manipulative and secret person” and his mother remarked that the respondent “possessed a propensity to abundantly and excessively lie”. The respondent told the author of the report that he did not recall the offences and apparently said that the only reason he conceded he committed the offences was because he had witnessed the video footage of himself. He believed his memory loss was based on excessive benzodiazepine use. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    24 The sentencing judge found that although the respondent had no criminal history this was “of little assistance to him.” Her Honour found that he was raised in circumstances “which can only be described as tragic for him.” However, her Honour concluded that neither his upbringing nor his apparent substance abuse were an excuse for his offending behaviour. 
     
      
    25 Her Honour was satisfied that the respondent had demonstrated remorse and contrition. However, she was guarded about his prospects for rehabilitation stating that “to some extent, I find he is still demonstrating a propensity to minimise his criminality.” Her Honour identified that these types of offences must attract a penalty which includes a significant component for general deterrence. 
     
      
    26 Her Honour was satisfied that the respondent had pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity and accordingly provided a 25% discount for his pleas of guilty. Her Honour also found special circumstances, a finding which the Crown prosecutor conceded was open to her Honour. 
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    27 The Crown submitted that her Honour’s sentencing remarks revealed a number of discrete errors. 
     
      
       
      1. The sentencing judge erred by failing to impose sentences in accordance with the principles enunciated by the High Court in  
      Pearce v The Queen  
      (1998) 194 CLR 160. 
       
       
      2. The sentencing judge erred in erroneously identifying the maximum penalty for count 9 as 8 years when it was 10 years. 
       
       
      3. The sentencing judge erred in failing to assess the objective seriousness of counts 4 and 5 being the possession of child pornography offences pursuant to s 91H(3). 
       
       
      4. The sentencing judge erred in reducing the non-parole period for special circumstances to 60%. 
       
      
    28 The Crown’s fundamental complaint is with respect to the extent of accumulation of the individual sentences. The effect of the commencing dates for each sentence determined by her Honour is that the only effective sentences are those imposed for counts 3 and 9. The other individual sentences are wholly subsumed by these sentences (see table to [7] above). 
     
      
    29 When sentencing her Honour decided to group each of the offences depending upon the particular victim. Accordingly, the sentences for counts 1 to 3 which involved WC are all concurrent. Counts 4 and 5 which relate to possession of videos of child pornography and computer material of child pornography were grouped with count 6 which relates to DD. The sentences for counts 7 to 9 relate to LT and were made concurrent although partly cumulative.  
     
      
    30 Although the groupings which her Honour chose can be explained by the identity of the individual victims the Crown submitted that this approach ignores the fact that some of the offences upon each of the victims were committed over a significant period of time and were not all part of the one episode of criminality. The first group of offences on WC occurred over an 18 month period with intercourse occurring between 1998 and late in 1999. The third group of offences committed on LT happened on a number of different occasions and not on the same day. It was submitted that if her Honour was to approach the sentencing exercise by providing entirely for concurrency of sentences within groups of offences on each of the victims, she ought to have ensured that accumulation between the groups of offences was significant enough to ensure that the overall sentence accurately reflected the totality of the offending. The Crown submitted that her Honour had failed to achieve this objective with the consequence that the overall sentence failed to adequately reflect the totality of the criminality involved. 
     
      
    31 The Crown emphasised that where there are a series of offences, with different victims, there is a special need to ensure that concurrency does not have the consequence that the overall sentence is inadequate. The relevant principles are to be found in R v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302 at [133]; 164 A Crim R 179; R v KM [2004] NSWCCA 65 at [56] and R v Cotter [2003] NSWCCA 273 at [69]. 
     
      
    32 The Crown further submitted that her Honour had failed to apply the settled principle that when there are discrete offences in relation to different victims the sentences should be accumulated. In R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim R 252 Johnson J said at [112]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is necessary to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of accumulation, concurrence and totality. The total effective sentence must represent a proper period of incarceration for the totality of the criminality involved:  
        R v AEM 
         (at [70]);  
        R v Kalache 
         (2000) 111 A Crim R 152 at 184. The mechanism of making some sentences cumulative and others concurrent (or partly so) may be used where the aggregate of sentences imposed in respect of each count exceeds the appropriate total sentence:  
        R v Myers 
         [2002] NSWCCA 162 at [34]. At the same time, it is necessary to ensure public confidence in the administration of justice by imposing sentences which do not suggest that multiple offences will be punished in the same way as one or two offences:  
        R v Wheeler 
         [2000] NSWCCA 34 at [36]-[37].” 
        
       
      
    33 The Crown submitted that the only effective sentences for all nine counts were those imposed for counts 3 and 9. Even then the concurrency with respect to those counts is such that the non-parole period for count 9 begins half way through the non-parole period for count 3. The respondent is left without any penalty at all in relation to 7 of the 9 counts for which he was sentenced. Of greatest concern is the fact that there has been no effective penalty at all for the second group of offences being the possession of child pornography or the criminal activity associated with the victim DD. 
     
      
    34 The Crown emphasised that the offences were serious. There were multiple victims involved with a series of criminal acts in relation to different victims. The sentencing judge found there was considerable planning by the respondent in enticing the victims to his home, setting up the video camera, assaulting the victims and ultimately recording what took place. The respondent’s conduct occurred over a very significant period of time and involved victims who were vulnerable because of their age and the relationship of trust created by the respondent. 
     
      
    35 Her Honour found the objective seriousness of the offences of sexual intercourse to be within the mid-range of objective seriousness. She found the indecent assault to fall above the mid-range and the use of victims for pornographic purposes also to be above the mid-range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    36 In relation to counts 4 and 5 her Honour made no finding in relation to objective seriousness. The Crown submitted that the appropriate finding was that they were in the high end of seriousness. The videos in count 4 were not obtained from outside sources downloaded from a computer. The respondent was actually responsible for creating them. In relation to count 5 some of the children were depicted in sexual acts and one was bound and gagged and subject to torture. There were thousands of images obtained over a lengthy period of time. The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed for this group of offences (2 years and 3 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months) is itself manifestly inadequate. When included as part of the second group of offences which included count 6 the inadequacy is further emphasised. The maximum penalty for each of counts 4, 5 and 6 is 5 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    37 Count 9 fell to be determined under the sentencing regime which commenced operation on 13 June 2003: R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434. Section 66C was amended and an increased penalty of 10 years was introduced for the offence of sexual intercourse with a person above the age of 14 years and under the age of 16 years. Although during the course of the sentencing hearing the correct penalty had been identified, her Honour when sentencing referred to s 66C(1) and a maximum penalty of 8 years imprisonment instead of 10 years. 
     
      
    38 In her submissions the respondent’s counsel drew attention to the well recognised principles relevant to a Crown appeal. They were summarised by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42. I need not repeat them. Although a Crown appeal should be rare and confined to establishing matters of principle for the guidance of sentencing courts nevertheless an appellate court may interfere to avoid manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing. 
     
      
    39 The respondent submitted that the sentences which her Honour imposed were not inadequate either individually or in total. Although it was accepted that the overall sentence was modest it was submitted that it fell within the appropriate range. Although the Court’s attention was drawn to some previous decisions it was acknowledged that they may not be of particular assistance. It was accepted that each case depends on its own circumstances. 
     
      
    40 With respect to the Crown’s challenge to her Honour’s finding of special circumstances it was submitted that at the sentence hearing the concession was made that such a finding would be appropriate. It was submitted that by reducing the non-parole period to 60% her Honour only provided a modest reduction in any event. 
     
      
    41 Notwithstanding that this Court must exercise considerable caution before intervening where there is a Crown appeal against sentence I have no doubt that intervention is required in the present case. The facts relating to the various offences disclose a course of serious criminal conduct over a number of years. That conduct involved the sexual abuse of 3 individual victims. In the ordinary course there should be a recognition of that separate offending by at least partial accumulation of the sentences (see Knight). By grouping counts 4, 5 and 6 together and imposing sentences which were made concurrent with other sentences the respondent received no effective punishment for these offences. Both counts 4 and 6 were very serious offences. The police located 8 video cassettes which showed teenage victims engaged in various sexual activities. Count 5 related to more than 1,000 images of pre-pubescent victims contained in a computer with many thousands of other images on computer discs. Count 6 involved the victim DD who was invited to remove his clothes and when he did was secretly filmed for at least 2 hours. One of the counts on the Form 1 related to the victim LT who was also secretly filmed, including an occasion when he was indecently assaulted by the respondent. 
     
      
    42 Having regard to the serious criminality involved in counts 4, 5 and 6 I am satisfied that even if the offences were appropriately grouped, about which I have significant reservations, the sentence should have been structured so that an identifiable period of imprisonment related to those offences.  
     
      
    43 The maximum penalty for count 9 was 10 years, although her Honour in her remarks on sentence suggests that she understood it to be 8 years. It is unclear whether this error has affected the sentencing process, although that would appear likely. 
     
      
    44 Apart from count 9 the Crown argued that a number of the individual sentences were inadequate. This criticism is made in particular of count 6 where, although the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years, her Honour imposed only a fixed term of 1 year. To my mind there is considerable force in the submission. However, mindful of the fact that this is a Crown appeal I would not propose any change to that sentence. I have reached the same conclusion with respect to the sentences imposed in relation to counts 8 and 9 which the Crown also criticised as being manifestly inadequate. To my mind the inadequacy can be adequately addressed by adjusting the relationship between each of the sentences to provide a greater period of fulltime custody. I would maintain her Honour’s finding of special circumstances. The respondent was entitled to the discount of his sentences for his early plea.  
     
      
    45 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
      1. Appeal upheld. 
       
      2. Quash the sentences imposed on 4 April 2008 in the District Court and impose the following sentences: 
       
      Count 1: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year commencing 2 March 2007 and expiring 1 March 2008. 
       
      Count 2: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years commencing 2 March 2007 and expiring 1 March 2009. 
       
      Count 3: Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 2 June 2007 and expiring on 1 June 2009 with a balance of term of 1 year, 4 months and 2 weeks expiring 15 October 2010. 
       
      Count 4: Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months commencing 2 August 2008 and expiring 1 February 2010 with a balance of term of 9 months expiring on 1 November 2010. 
       
      Count 5: Imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 2 October 2008 and expiring 1 April 2010 with a balance of term of 9 months expiring on 1 January 2011. 
       
      Count 6: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year commencing on 2 July 2009 and expiring on 1 July 2010. 
       
      Count 7: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 1 year commencing on 2 November 2009 and expiring on 1 November 2010. 
       
      Count 8: Imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months commencing on 2 January 2010 and expiring on 1 July 2011. 
       
      Count 9: Taking into account Form 1 matters: imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing 2 March 2010 and expiring on 1 March 2012 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 1 March 2014. 
       
       
      Accordingly, the overall sentence will be a total non-parole period of five years commencing 2 March 2007 and expiring on 1 March 2012, with a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 1 March 2014.

    1 BASTEN JA: This appeal should be allowed and the convictions quashed for the reasons given by Price J. 
     
      
    2 HISLOP J: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    3 PRICE J: The sole ground of appeal is that the trial Judge erred in directing the jury that the appellant’s alleged lies can be taken into account as consciousness of guilt. 
     
      
    4 The appellant was tried in the District Court on an indictment which contained three counts of having homosexual intercourse with a male person above the age of 10 years and under the age of 18 years contrary to s 78K of the Crimes Act 1900. Each of the counts alleged an act of fellatio on M between 1 January 1987 and 6 August 1987. As M was born on 9 May 1973, he was aged 13-14 years at the time of the offences. The jury returned a verdict of guilty on each count.  
     
      
    5 On the first count, the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 15 months to date from 3 April 2007 and to expire on 2 July 2008. On the second count, the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 15 months to date from 3 September 2007 and to expire on 2 December 2008. On the third count a fixed term of imprisonment of 15 months to date from 3 September 2007 and to expire on 2 December 2008 was imposed. A period of parole of 15 months was set to commence on 3 December 2008 and to expire on 2 March 2010. The total effective sentence was a non-parole period of 20 months to date from 3 April 2007 and to expire on 2 December 2008 with an additional term of 15 months.  
     
      
       
      The evidence at trial  
       
      
    6 The Crown case was that the appellant had performed the fellatio on M when M attended the Serfontein Clinic for treatment for his learning difficulties and behavioural problems. The appellant was employed at the clinic as a neuro-nurse technician and one of his tasks involved a testing procedure called neuro-metrics.  
     
      
    7 As the trial was a re-trial after a successful appeal by the appellant against conviction following an earlier trial in the District Court on the same counts in 2004, M’s evidence was given by way of an edited audio recording of his testimony at the first trial pursuant to s 306E of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
     
      
    8 M gave evidence that on his second visit to the clinic he was taken by the appellant to a room for a neurological test. He was told to strip down to his underwear. During testing M was fitted with electrodes. He said while he was doing the test the appellant asked him whether he had sex before, whether he had a boy friend or girl friend and then the appellant asked, “Have you ever had your penis sucked?” and he replied “No”. The appellant told him, “Surely you have, you know, you are quite an attractive young man with, you know, beautiful features” and that he was very tanned and brown. M said the appellant got down and sucked his penis. He said he put his pants back on and the appellant told him, “It’s not so bad, see you’ve probably had it done before but you are not telling me.” The appellant gave him a film capsule full of cannabis and about $60-80. This was the conduct which was alleged to constitute the first count on the indictment. M said he did not tell his parents what he had done to him because they were at that time going through a very bad separation. He did not want to cause any more friction and put pressure on them.  
     
      
    9 The offence the subject of count 2 was alleged to have taken place during the fourth visit when M was undergoing neurological testing. M said that the appellant got down on his knees and sucked M’s penis, sliding M’s underpants off. The appellant gave him about $50 and some cannabis. M said he did not tell anyone about what had happened because he was young and already in trouble, had already been expelled from school and did not want to be in any more trouble. During his sixth visit to the clinic, M said that he went into the testing room and was made to strip down to his underwear. The appellant sucked M’s penis and gave him some money and some cannabis. This act of fellatio was not the subject of a charge before the jury.  
     
      
    10 The offence the subject of count 3 was alleged to have occurred on M’s seventh and last visit to the clinic. When M was undergoing neurological testing, the appellant made him strip down to his underwear and then sucked M’s penis saying to him: 
     
      
       
        
        “Just don’t worry about anything, you’re a strong boy.” 
        
       
       
      M testified he did not tell anyone about this incident as he did not want to see his mother in more turmoil as she was already seeing a psychiatrist. M said he thought he and his mother moved to Magnetic Island at the beginning of August 2007. He said he never went back to the clinic.  
       
      
    11 M also gave evidence that on two occasions the appellant drove him to the appellant’s flat. The first occasion took place after his third visit to the clinic. He had been neurologically tested by the appellant and no sexual activity had taken place. After the test was completed he got a lift home with the appellant. M said they went down the lift into a fairly large but not well lit car park and “got in a dark coloured Volvo”. He said to the best of his knowledge the car was parked underneath the building in which was the clinic. The appellant drove him to an area which was a headland between Bondi and Clovelly. He said he knew the area well as he had been a fanatical surfer as a child. He could distinctly smell and hear the surf. He said the appellant parked his car underneath an older style building and walked up a very thin flight of stairs which was external to the building up to a studio apartment. In the apartment the appellant gave him cannabis to smoke and bourbon or whisky to drink. No sexual activity occurred. He was driven to his home at Haberfield by the appellant at about 8.30 - 9pm.  
     
      
    12 The second visit to the apartment occurred after M’s fifth visit to the clinic. He was tested by the appellant but nothing sexual occurred. After that the appellant offered him a lift home in his car. He said the car was parked in a car park that appeared to be in the basement and the same spot as on the previous occasion. M said they sat in the car for five or ten minutes just talking, then the appellant performed oral sex on him. He was given some money and cannabis by the appellant who then drove him to his unit and they went inside. M said they smoked cannabis and drank alcohol together and there was a sex movie on the television. The appellant asked whether he could perform oral sex on him to which M replied “No”. He said he also refused the appellant’s request for M to perform sex on him and for the appellant to masturbate him. There was no sexual activity between them in the unit and the appellant drove him, M said, home to Haberfield. The act of fellatio in the car park was not charged. 
     
      
    13 M gave evidence that he told his wife about all these incidents approximately three or four years ago after they watched a documentary on television about child abuse. He reported the matter to police about two to three years ago. He said the reason why it took so long for him to do that was because he was not ready for it.  
     
      
    14 In cross-examination by Mr Pontello, the appellant’s counsel during the first trial, M had told the jury that he was a big fan of the band, the Eurythmics. He did not recall the appellant asking him during one of the visits to the clinic what kind of music did he like listening to nor did he recall the appellant telling him that he had a Eurythmics cassette. M denied that he had asked if he could borrow it. He further denied bumping into the appellant at the Bondi Junction Mall, asking him if he had the tape in his car and saying to him that he lived at Haberfield, could they get the cassette and give him a lift home to Haberfield. He said that he did not go with the appellant to his apartment and collect the tape.  
     
      
    15 Mrs Barbara Serfontein, the widow of Dr Gordon Serfontein who established the clinic, said that the appellant was employed by the clinic in 1987 as a neuro-technician. The records that she had located confirmed that M had attended the clinic on at least three occasions. Neurological tests, she said, were conducted in an enclosed room with no windows and one door. The testing procedure would take up to one hour and electrodes would be put on the children’s heads. During testing, the children would not have to remove their clothes except if they were wearing caps or bulky overcoats.  
     
      
    16 Mrs Doreen Murray, a remedial teacher employed by the clinic, recalled that the appellant owned a green coloured Volvo sedan which he drove to work a couple of times a week and parked at the Domain Car Park costing him about $10 per day. She said he lived in Clovelly. She testified that children could play a computer game called Donkey Kong in the waiting room of the Serfontein clinic or in the neurological testing room while they were waiting. Mrs Eileen Vaughan, a receptionist employed by the clinic in 1987, recalled a conversation between Mrs Murray and the appellant about the expense of his driving to work and parking at the Domain Car Park. She heard the appellant tell Mrs Murray that he liked to have his car in the city because he could use it after hours.  
     
      
    17 Detective Senior Constable Capon testified that M reported to The Rocks Police Station on 21 June 2002 about being sexually assaulted by the appellant in 1987. His enquiries had included obtaining records from the Department of Fair Trading which showed that the appellant previously leased a unit at 1/336 Clovelly Road, Clovelly from January 1984 to April 1987 and that he also leased another unit at 8/1 Thorpe Street, Clovelly from May 1987 to April 1989. He had been to the Clovelly Road unit and there was no view of the ocean from the bathroom window. In order to enter the Thorpe Street unit, there was a stairway that went down the side of the building. The police officer said he could hear the sound of the ocean waves crashing on the rocks from that unit. Records from the Roads and Traffic Authority revealed, he said, that the appellant owned a 1974 model green Volvo between July 1984 and 24 August 1987. There was no underground parking at the clinic.  
     
      
    18 In evidence during the trial, the appellant denied he had ever sexually assaulted M. He also denied that he had supplied him with cannabis or alcohol. He said he remembered the complainant when he attended the clinic in 1987 because he had an “amazing haircut” and he found out later that his mother was a hairdresser. He said that M came to his testing room to play the Donkey Kong game. He testified that M once followed him down to Martin Place when he was getting his lunch. He said they had a discussion about the pop group the Eurythmics. He told M that he had a tape of the Eurythmics given to him by a friend and M asked if he could borrow that tape. 
     
      
    19 He said in 1987 when he was on his way home from work he ran into M in the Bondi Junction Mall and M asked if he had the Eurythmics tape. He told M that he had the tape in his unit and he was going to play pool at Leichhardt. M told him he lived in Haberfield and if they picked up the tape then it would not be far out of his way to drop him home. The appellant said he took M to his unit in Thorpe Street Clovelly in his green Volvo. M accompanied him inside the unit and the appellant found the tape and gave it to him. He said they left the unit, returned to the car and he then drove M to Haberfield before going on to Leichhardt. 
     
      
    20 The trial advocate’s cross-examination of the appellant included a close examination of his account of the encounter at the mall and M’s attendance at his unit to pick up the Eurythmics tape. The trial advocate suggested to him that he had “just made up” in the witness box his evidence about getting the tape back from M’s house which the appellant rejected. The trial advocate did not directly put to him that he had lied about the encounter at the mall or the exchange of the Eurythmics tape although it is evident that the appellant’s version of these events was challenged in cross-examination. 
     
      
    21 The appellant’s sister, Bernadette Mason, gave evidence that the appellant did not have a video player or recorder at the time when she and her husband helped him move from one unit in Clovelly to another. She did not see any video tapes. She had visited his unit on many occasions and during those visits she had never observed a video or cassette player in the unit. In cross-examination, she said during moving there were unopened boxes and she could not remember looking at those boxes and she did not know what was inside.  
     
      
       
      Closing addresses  
       
      
    22 During her closing address, the trial advocate said (T 242-243): 
     
      
       
        
        “The complainant agreed that he was a big fan of the Eurythmics and had in fact gone to one of their concerts with his parents and it was suggested to him that the accused had bumped into him in Bondi Junction Mall and that they had that encounter that led to [M] being taken to the accused’s apartment and being given that Eurythmics tape. 
        
       
       
        
        [M] denies that that incident occurred at all. The Crown says you will accept [M’s] evidence about that.  
        
       
      
     … 
     
      
       
        
        But [M] was able to describe that unit in Phillip (sic) Street you might think, and you might think that the accused’s version of how [M] came to be was just made up to explain why [M] could describe that unit.” 
        
       
      
    23 Mr Martin, counsel for the appellant, addressed the issue of the conflict in the testimony between M and the appellant as to the Eurythmics tape and the meeting at Bondi Junction as follows (T 257-258): 
     
      
       
        
        “One of the things the Crown relied upon on was the fact that the complainant denied that there was this conversation that took place at Martin Place, and denies that there was this exchange about the Eurythmics either at Martin Place or at Bondi Junction. It does make you wonder how then in 2004 did Mr Pontello, the man who was asking the questions, how did he know to ask these questions. “Are you familiar with the band the Eurythmics?” “Yes”. “Well did you listen to them?” “I sure did in the first half of 1987 I went to their rock concert with my mother and step-father in 87 or 6.” So you were a fan were you? “I was a big fan of the Eurythmics.” Why does Mr Pontello out of all the rock groups in the world, in 1987 I guess, why does he pick out the Eurythmics. Well one of the ways in which he would have picked out the Eurythmics is because he would be acting on the instructions of the accused which you might think might be along the lines of I knew this kid, I remembered him, he was a big fan of the Eurythmics and he borrowed a Eurythmics tape from me. How else would Mr Pontello be able to narrow in on that particular choice and yet the Crown says well the complainant says that conversation didn’t take [sic] in Martin Place, didn’t take place in Bondi Junction.”  
        
       
       
       
       
       
      
     Discussions between the trial Judge and counsel  
     
      
    24 After closing addresses had been completed and in the absence of the jury the following discussion between the trial judge and counsel took place (T2 30/3/07): 
     
      
       
        
        “Trial Advocate: Mr Martin might like to turn his mind as to whether he seeks a  
        Zoneff 
         or  
        Edwards  
        direction concerning lies.  
        
       
      
     His Honour: Well I don’t think - again that’s not been put. 
     
      
       
        
        Trial Advocate: Well I suggested to the accused in his evidence and to the jury that he’d lied about the suggestion that he’d given the complainant the Eurythmics tape and that encounter at Bondi Junction and his evidence that he subsequently went to the complainant’s home, so… 
        
       
      
     His Honour: Well yes I must say it’s… 
     
      
     Trial Advocate: It’s just a question of which direction I suppose. 
     
      
       
        
        His Honour: …usually given when it’s the complainant’s accused of lying but very well you can think about the  
        Zoneff 
         direction Mr Martin. 
        
       
       
        
        Martin: I suggest that it’s inappropriate, it’s a matter of--  
        
       
      
     His Honour: -- Do you want a Zoneff direction or not? 
     
      
       
        
        Martin: No your Honour it’s not appropriate when it’s merely a matter of cross-examination, it’s not an allegation that these are material lies told about matters directly related to an element of the offence.  
        
       
      
     His Honour: It is ancillary to it but it is a lie that’s put.  
     
      
       
        
        Trial Advocate Well I would just comment your Honour there is a risk that the jury might use the suggestion that the accused had made up this version of this encounter to explain why the complainant was able to describe his unit… 
        
       
      
     His Honour: The flat in such detail. 
     
      
       
        
        Trial Advocate: And they might reason that that was because of the consciousness of guilt even, not that I put it on that basis your Honour but there is that risk. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: Well I think you’d better – if I’m going to put the consciousness of guilt we’d better work out what basis we’re going to put it Ms Crown.  
        
       
      
     Trial Advocate: Yes 
     
      
     His Honour: You might let me know Monday morning. 
     
      
     Trial Advocate: Yes your Honour.  
     
      
       
        
        His Honour: What form you want that to take. I think there’s got to be some direction given about it now. 
        
       
      
     Trial Advocate: Yes your Honour.”  
     
      
    25 In his evidence during the trial, the appellant had contradicted in important respects what M had said. The trial advocate had not put to him in cross-examination that he had lied about the encounter at the mall or the exchange of the Eurythmics tape. She had, however, suggested to the jury that his version of how M came to be in his unit was made up to explain why M could describe the unit.  
     
      
    26 As somewhat cryptic references are made by the trial Judge and counsel to Edwards and Zoneff directions during their discussions and, as will become apparent, their minds may not have been in harmony about what was meant by such references, it is necessary to identify what are Edwards and Zoneff directions.  
     
      
    27 An Edwards direction is a full direction in accordance with the principles set out in Edwards v The Queen (1993) 178 CLR 193. The key passage in the majority opinion (Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ) is at 210: 
     
      
       
        
        “A lie can constitute an admission against interest only if it is concerned with some circumstance or event connected with the offence (ie it relates to a material issue) and if it was told by the accused in circumstances in which the explanation for the lie is that he knew that the truth would implicate him in the offence. Thus, in any case where a lie is relied upon to prove guilt, the lie should be precisely identified, as should the circumstances and events that are said to indicate that it constitutes an admission against interest… and that it was told because the accused knew that the truth of the matter about which he lied would implicate him in the offence, or, as was said in R v Lucas (Ruth), because of ‘a realisation of guilt and a fear of the truth’.  
        
       
       … 
       
        
        If the telling of a lie by an accused is relied upon, not merely to strengthen the prosecution case, but as corroboration of some other evidence, the untruthfulness of the relevant statement must be established otherwise than through the evidence of the witness whose evidence is to be corroborated. If a witness required to be corroborated is believed in preference to the accused and this alone establishes the lie on the part of the accused, reliance upon the lie for corroboration would amount to the witness corroborating himself. That is a contradiction in terms.”  
        
       
      
    28 An Edwards direction, as a general rule, should only be given if the prosecution contends that a lie is evidence of consciousness of guilt: Zoneff v The Queen (2000) 200 CLR 234 at 244.  
     
      
    29 The trial advocate during her cross-examination did not expressly or impliedly contend that the appellant’s evidence about the encounter at the mall or the Eurythmics tape was given because he knew that the truth would implicate him in the commission of the offences. Furthermore, no such submission was made by the trial advocate to the members of the jury when she addressed them.  
     
      
    30 What is known as a Zoneff direction is generally given in cases:  
     
      
       
        
        “…in which there is a risk of a misunderstanding about the significance of possible lies even though the prosecution has not suggested that the accused has told certain lies because he or she knew the truth would implicate him or her in the commission of the offence.” 
         See  
        Zoneff v The Queen 
         per Gleeson CJ, Gaudron, Gummow and Callinan JJ at [24].  
        
       
      
    31 An appropriate direction for such a case was said by the majority in Zoneff  at [23] to be in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “You have heard a lot of questions, which attribute lies to the accused. You will make up your own mind about whether he was telling lies and if he was, whether he was doing so deliberately. It is for you to decide what significance those suggested lies have in relation to the issues in the case but I give you this warning: do not follow a process of reasoning to the effect that just because a person is shown to have told a lie about something, that is evidence of guilt.”  
        
       
      
    32 After further discussions with counsel in the jury’s absence the trial Judge returned to the question of a direction on lies. After asking the trial advocate whether she had actually put to the appellant that he was lying to which the trial advocate replied she had and had told his Honour it was in the transcript, the trial Judge said (T 14 30/3/07): 
     
      
       
        
        “…Well on that basis it probably looks like it’s going to have to be but I’ll hear you further both on Monday morning. Mr Martin as well.”  
        
       
       
      and then went on to suggest to both counsel that they might agree as to the form the direction should take. The trial Judge then added: 
       
      
     “Whether it’s a complete Zoneff or the limited one.”  
     
      
    33 With respect to his Honour, what was meant by a complete or limited Zoneff is not entirely clear. His Honour’s recollection, however, that the Crown had not put to the appellant that he was telling lies when he gave his account of meeting M at the mall and of the exchange of the Eurythmics tape was correct. It might be that the trial advocate was mistaken in her response to his Honour’s question with her suggestion to the appellant that he had made up a story in the witness box about getting the tape back, contacting M about it and going to his house to collect it. (T 203 L 15- 20 29/3/07)  
     
      
    34 In any event, when the Court reconvened on the following Monday, further discussion ensued in the jury’s absence concerning a lies direction. The trial advocate identified the lies that she was referring to as to the encounter at the mall, the exchange of the Eurythmics tape and that the appellant then got the tape back from M. The following exchange then took place between the trial Judge and counsel (T 3 2/4/07): 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour: Now Mr Martin, it’s over to you. Do you wish to have a direction for … 
        
       
      
     Martin: No, your Honour, I think… 
     
      
       
        
        His Honour: For forensic reasons. I mean the direction under  
        Zoneff  
        they make it quite clear the jury has to be satisfied it’s a deliberate lie.  
        
       
       
        
        Martin: They have got to be satisfied that it is a lie and it has got to have a character that is evidence of consciousness of guilt and a fear of the truth. Both of those incidents, that my friend refers to, are evidence of further contact between  
         
          
           
            
             
              
              the -- 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        His Honour: It’s got to relate to an issue that is material and it reveals a knowledge of the offence and it was told because the accused knew that the truth of the matter would implicate him on the offences charged. It seems to come within those three criteria, doesn’t it? You would say so, Ms Crown, would you not? 
        
       
       
        
        Crown Prosecutor: I think that there is a risk that the jury might use it in that way, your Honour, and my submission is that a  
        Zoneff  
        direction at the very least is called for in this case.  
        
       
      
     His Honour: I think that’s right, Mr Martin. 
     
      
       
        
        Martin: I don’t want to cavil with your Honour about that. 
        
       
      
     His Honour: Well I’ll give a Zoneff direction-- 
     
      
       
        
        Martin: I accept that the  
        Zoneff 
         if your Honour takes that view that the  
        Zoneff 
         direction is appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    35 Whilst his Honour was referring to a Zoneff direction it appears from what was said that he had in mind an Edwards-type direction. What was understood by the trial advocate from this exchange is unclear.  
     
      
    36 Following further questions from the trial Judge the trial advocate confined her identification of what were said to be lies to the encounter at the mall with M and to the exchange of the Eurythmics tape at the unit.  
     
      
    37 His Honour went on to discuss with Mr Martin what would be said to the jury about how the appellant met the allegation of lying. The trial Judge asked Mr Martin if it was sufficient to tell the jury (T 5 2/4/07): 
     
      
       
        
        “The accused meets the allegation of lying when he gave you an account of [M] telling him he was a great fan of the Eurythmics, and this occurred when the accused and [M] were at Martin Place before the casual meeting in the Bondi Mall recounted to you by the accused.” 
        
       
      
     to which his Honour received Mr Martin’s affirmative response.  
     
      
    38 After some further discussion on matters unrelated to this appeal, the jury was brought into court and the trial Judge commenced his summing up. 
     
      
       
      The direction to the jury  
       
      
    39 On the question of lies, the trial Judge gave the following direction to the jury (su 31-33): 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury, the Crown submits to you that the accused has lied to you and those lies are briefly that, the first lie being, the Crown alleges, that there was an encounter at the Bondi Junction Mall with [M]. The second lie, the crown alleges, the accused said was that there was an exchange of the Eurythmics tape at the unit of the accused.  
        
       
       
        
        Members of the jury, what then is a lie? A lie may be defined as speaking untruthfully with intent to mislead or deceive or to convey a false impression or practise a deception. Statements can be inaccurate without being a lie as the author may simply be mistaken or may be labouring out of misconception or misunderstanding. On the other hand, sometimes statements that are literally true may be used to mislead or deceive. The accused meets the allegation of lie when he gave you an account of [M] telling him he was a great fan of the Eurythmics pop group and this occurred when the accused and [M] were at Martin Place before the casual meeting at Bondi Mall, recounted here by the accused.  
        
       
       
        
        Members of the jury, before you can take these asserted lies, as alleged by the crown, into account as evidence of the guilt of the accused you must be satisfied that it was in fact not only lies but also deliberate lies. If you are not so satisfied you cannot use it for this purpose. If, however, you are satisfied that they were deliberate lies then you must also be satisfied that the lies, one, relate to an issue that is material or relevant to the offences charged and two, that the lies reveal a knowledge of the offence or some aspect of it and three, the lies were told because the accused knew that the truth of the matter about which he lied would implicate him in the offence charged or to put it another way, because of a realisation of guilt and fear of the truth. I emphasise that you must be satisfied of what was in his mind was guilt of the offence charged and not some other crime. You must remember, however, that people do not always act rationally and that conduct of this sort may sometimes be explained in other ways. There may be many reasons for telling a lie apart from realisation of guilt. For example, a lie may be told out of panic to escape an unjust accusation or to protect some other person or to avoid consequences unrelated to this offence. If you think there is a reasonable possibility that the lie was told for such a reason or the lies were told for such a reason then you cannot use it for this purpose. If you are satisfied, however, that the three matters I set out above to which I have referred then you are entitled to use the finding in aid of the other evidence of the crown case as pointing to the guilt of the accused. Standing by itself, however, it could not prove guilt.” 
        
       
      
    40 Shortly before the summing up had been completed, Mr Martin in the absence of the jury asked the Judge for its discharge. The following exchange then ensued between Mr Martin and his Honour (T 45 2/4/07): 
     
      
       
        
        “MARTIN: …It’s my motion that your Honour should discharge the jury. Your Honour has directed them that they can take into account alleged lies. The said lies are said to arise by the Crown suggesting to the accused in the witness box that he has given false accounts in relation to two incidents. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              There is no independent evidence, in my submission, that the Crown points to, or could point to, indicating that those matters are lies. It is a mere contradiction by the complainant and in the absence of independent evidence from which the jury can conclude independently that those things were lies, then the Zoneff direction that your Honour has given is inappropriate and unnecessarily draws attention to contradictions that are merely contradictions between the complainant’s evidence and the accused’s evidence giving it an evidentiary value that it does not have-- 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: That’s the submission on lies, is it, before you go on to something else? 
        
       
      
     MARTIN: Yes your Honour. My submission is that-- 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well, we’ll deal with that first then. Firstly Mr Martin, I discussed what I was going to put to the jury in your presence, I asked for your comment, without the actual lies that I was going to do, and there was no demur from you. 
        
       
      
     MARTIN: Your Honour -- 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Martin, I haven’t quite finished and I put it to you quite clearly and you agreed. That’s the first point I make, quite clearly, and secondly a lie is a lie. It’s a verbal statement and it could be true or false. So I reject your application…” 
        
       
      
     Mr Martin took his application no further.  
     
      
     Submissions 
     
      
    41 The appellant submitted that where the Crown had disavowed the use of the alleged lies as being available on the question of consciousness of guilt, the trial Judge should have specifically directed the jury that the alleged lies were not available for this purpose. By directing the jury in accordance with Edwards v The Queen, the alleged lies had been left to the jury as being available to be used as consciousness of the appellant’s guilt even though the Crown had not suggested that they were capable of being used in that way. A miscarriage of justice had occurred and the convictions should be overturned.  
     
      
    42 The Crown agreed that it would have been better if the trial Judge had given a Zoneff direction but submitted that the trial Judge’s direction whilst raising the prospect of lies evidencing consciousness of guilt effectively removed that possibility from the jury’s consideration by the limitations it imposed on lies. The jury would have appreciated that the visits to the house could only have been evidence of the relationship between the appellant and M. Given the directions as to the limited use that could be made of the uncharged acts the jury would not have reasoned that any more use could be made of the visits to the apartment where no sexual acts took place. They would not have been satisfied that the lies (if they were found to be lies) revealed a knowledge of the offences or some aspect of them and were told because the appellant knew the truth would implicate him in the offences charged. The jury, the Crown submitted, may have considered it possible that he lied although no offence occurred in the unit because the visits were in the circumstances inappropriate and did not reflect well on his character. To find that the appellant had lied, the jury had to have decided that M was a credible witness. Having reached that conclusion, the Crown contended conviction was inevitable.  
     
      
       
       
       
      Dealing with the Appeal  
       
      
    43 The direction which his Honour gave as to the alleged lies was a full direction in accordance with Edwards v The Queen. It seems that there had been an unfortunate misunderstanding between the trial Judge and counsel for the appellant. Mr Martin’s acceptance of a direction being given on the alleged lies, it appears, was founded upon the understanding that his Honour’s charge to the jury would be given in the terms recommended in Zoneff v The Queen. This case highlights what has been often said that the topic of lies must be approached with considerable care: see for example R v Sutton (1986) 5 NSWLR 697, Edwards v The Queen, Zoneff v The Queen, R v Ray (2003) 57 NSWLR 616. Whilst it is evident that his Honour diligently applied himself to the question of the alleged lies when it was raised by the trial advocate, his Honour’s reference to a “complete Zoneff or the limited one” was unhelpful. It was incumbent upon counsel when directions were being discussed if there was ambiguity to raise that with the trial Judge so that any misunderstanding might be removed.  
     
      
    44 The trial advocate had not contended that the alleged lies had been told out of consciousness of guilt but had drawn the trial Judge’s attention to the risk that the jury might use her suggestion that the appellant had made up his version of how M came to be in his unit to reason that he did so because of consciousness of guilt. The risk of a misunderstanding by the jury about the use of the alleged lies could have been dealt with by a direction which included a warning not to follow a process of reasoning that just because they found that the alleged lies had been established that those lies were evidence of the appellant’s guilt and the trial advocate had not suggested that they should be. The direction given by the trial Judge did not provide any instruction so as to eliminate the risk of circular reasoning.  
     
      
    45 Although an Edwards direction may be given to protect an accused where there is a real danger that a jury may view an accused’s lie as evidence of guilt even though the prosecution has not contended this, such a direction:  
     
      
       
        
        “…s 
        hould be done in terms that make it clear that it is given for such reason, and that ensures that the evidence is not used in a way which risks bolstering the prosecution case, by being elevated to an admission of guilt” 
        :  
        R v Ray 
         per Wood CJ at CL at [100].  
        
       
      
    46 The members of the jury were not informed by the trial Judge that the purpose of the direction was to protect the appellant nor was it given in terms which ensured that the alleged lies were not used to bolster the prosecution case by being elevated to an admission of guilt. By the instruction given, the jury was entitled to use the appellant’s evidence of the encounter at the mall and the exchange of the Eurythmics tape in aid of other evidence in the Crown case as pointing to the guilt of the appellant if it was satisfied that what was said were deliberate lies which related to an issue that was material to the offences charged and revealed in the appellant a knowledge of those offences and were told by him because of the realisation of guilt and fear of the truth.  
     
      
    47 The Crown’s contention that the members of the jury could not have been satisfied of these matters is to be rejected. Although his Honour had directed the jury that the evidence of the two uncharged acts of oral sex had been admitted into evidence “solely for the purpose of placing the evidence of the three other acts relied upon by the Crown in the indictment into a true and realistic context” (SU 17), nothing was said as to the relevance of the visits to the unit or the use that the jury could make of that evidence. The jury was not reminded of what had been said by the trial advocate in her opening address that the evidence of the visits would be given so that the members of the jury could understand the complete relationship that existed between M and the appellant (T 69).  
     
      
    48 It was necessary for the trial Judge to provide in clear terms a warning to the jury that it could not engage in circular reasoning and treat any lie found to have been told by the appellant as affording evidence of his guilt of the offences. A suitably adapted direction in the terms suggested in the passage from Zoneff I have quoted at [31] was required. His Honour’s charge to the jury enhanced the importance of the alleged lies so that they could be used as evidence of the appellant’s guilt. I am satisfied that the appeal has been established.  
     
      
    49 This was a trial in which the critical evidence was M’s word against the word of the appellant. The Crown’s case had its limitations which included a lengthy delay in M’s complaint. The verdicts of guilty would not otherwise have been inevitable. The misdirection was, in my opinion, of a nature which caused a miscarriage of justice and the proviso does not apply. 
     
      
    50 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Appeal allowed. 
        
       
      
     2. Convictions quashed.  
     
      
    51 The non-parole period of the appellant’s sentence expires on 2 December 2008. It is for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide whether in view of the time served by the appellant and the previous trials whether he should be put on trial again.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    2 ROTHMAN J: I have had the benefit of reading in draft the reasons for judgment of Price J and the orders he proposes. I agree with the orders proposed by Price J and with his reasons. I wish to add the following comments.  
     
      
    3 It is unnecessary to recite the facts. The outcome of the appeal against conviction depends upon the correct statutory construction of legislation promulgated in 1996 that amended the pre-existing legislation. I shall refer to the pre-existing legislation (the Police Act 1990) as the 1990 Act; and the legislation promulgated in 1996 as the 1996 Amendment or the legislation as the 1996 Act.  
     
      
    4 The appellants submit that the ordinary and grammatical meaning of s 200(3) of the 1996 Act is to confine the time for a prosecution to be taken to 2 years from the date of the offence. The appellants submit, in essence, that it is impermissible to use the history of the legislation to create an ambiguity where none otherwise exists: see Re Building Workers' Industrial Union of Australia Ex Parte Pillar [1991] HCA 50; (1992) 174 CLR 263.  
     
      
    5 The Crown, on the other hand, submits that the history discloses no parliamentary intention in the 1996 Amendments to limit the time otherwise available for the prosecution of an indictable offence.  
     
      
    6 The effect of the Interpretation Act 1987 on the construction of the word “may” does not seem central to the issue under consideration. In the context of s 200(3) of the 1996 Act, “may” is facultative or permissive; it allows, or grants authority: see Re Coldham ex parte Brideson [No 1] (1989) 166 CLR 338 at 347-348. 7 The construction urged by the appellants implies, in s 200(3) of the 1996 Act, the exclusion of the capacity to institute proceedings outside the 2 year period expressed. This is achieved by use of a construction tool summarised in the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius or expressum facit cessare tacitum. In other words, the appellants submit that s 200(3) of the 1996 Act should read as if the word “only” was inserted before the words “within 2 years”. Otherwise expressed, the appellants seek to have the subsection construed as if it read “within 2 years and not otherwise”. 
     
      
    8 The underlying philosophy behind the above maxims of construction gives rise to a number of construction tools variously expressed: “inclusio unius”, “general and specific”, “expressum facit cessare tacitum”. Each is “a valuable servant, but a dangerous master”: Houssein v Under Secretary of Industrial Relations & Technology (NSW) [1982] HCA 2; (1982) 148 CLR 88 at 94 citing Colquhoun v Brooks (1888) 21 QBD 52, at p 65. (See for their appropriate application Saraswati v R [1991] HCA 21; (1991) 172 CLR 1 at 23-24 and the cases there cited.) 
     
      
    9 But the “ordinary” meaning of s 200(3) of the 1996 Act allows the commencement (either as a summary offence or on indictment) within 2 years. It does not preclude the commencement beyond 2 years, if authority otherwise exists. In order to derive that limitation, an inference must be drawn from the provisions.  
     
      
    10 As Price J observes the 1996 Amendments were introduced into the NSW Parliament together with the Police Corruption Bill 1996. The purpose of these cognate statutes was to deal with the mischief uncovered by Justice Wood in the Royal Commission. That Royal Commission disclosed systemic corruption over many decades and revealed the lengthy time period over which such corruption could be hidden. It would be both absurd and repugnant to the purpose of the statute, in those circumstances, to imply a limitation period of 2 years to prevent prosecution on indictment otherwise available within a 7 year period.  
     
      
    11 Such a limitation would be achieved without the parliament expressly or otherwise adverting to the limitation and as an unintended result of rendering the offence more serious by providing for it to be prosecuted on indictment. I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    12 PRICE J: The issue which this appeal raises is whether some of the offences to which the appellants, Janice Seeto and Stephen Richard Evans, had pleaded guilty and were sentenced in the District Court were at the time of the institution of proceedings statute barred.  
     
      
    13 Janice Seeto entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court to nine offences contrary to s 200(2)(a) of the Police Act 1990 and was committed to the District Court for sentence. The first eight offences involved her giving a bribe to Senior Constable Evans, a member of the New South Wales Police Force. These offences were committed from 27 February 2003 to 29 September 2006. The ninth offence which occurred between September 2006 and January 2007 involved an attempt to bribe another member of the Police Force, a Constable Davies. The proceedings against Ms Seeto, it appears, had been commenced by the issue and filing of nine Court attendance notices, (CANS) on 23 May 2007 in the Downing Centre Local Court. 
     
      
    14 Ms Seeto adhered to her pleas in the District Court and a further 35 offences on a Form 1 were taken into account by the Judge when she came to be sentenced on 3 April 2008. A total aggregate term of 21 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 months dating from 3 April 2008 was imposed by the Judge.  
     
      
    15 Stephen Richard Evans had entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court to eight offences contrary to s 200(1) of the Police Act and was committed to the District Court for sentence. All of the offences involved receiving a bribe from Ms Seeto whilst he was serving as a member of the NSW Police Force and the dates on which those offences were committed were necessarily the same as those committed by Ms Seeto. Senior Constable Evans adhered to his pleas in the District Court and a further 35 offences were taken into account on a Form 1 when he came to be sentenced by the Judge at the same time as Ms Seeto. A total aggregate term of imprisonment of 1 year 10 months with a non-parole period of 12 months dating from 3 April 2008 was imposed by the Judge. 
     
      
    16 The proceedings against Senior Constable Evans had also been commenced by the issue and filing of eight CANS, it appears, in the Downing Centre Local Court on 23 May 2007. 
     
      
    17 The sole ground of appeal for each of the appellants is that the proceedings for the offences of 27 February 2003, 1 December 2003, 25 February 2004 and 11 October 2004 were statute barred by reason of subsection 3 of s 200 of the Police Act. The appeals had also specified an offence on 1 February 2005 but the appeals in relation to those offences were not pressed.  
     
      
       
       
       
       
      
    18 Sections 200(3) and (4) of the Police Act stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “(3) Proceedings for an offence against this section may be taken within 2 years after the act or omission alleged to constitute the offence. 
        
       
      
     (4) An offence under this section is an indictable offence.” 
     
      
       
      Section 200(3) was repealed on 1 February 2007 by the  
      Police Amendment (Miscellaneous) Act 
       2006 which contained no relevant transitional or consequential provisions. Although s 200(3) was repealed by the time the proceedings against the appellants were commenced it is common ground that the subsection has application to offences committed prior to its repeal.  
       
      
    19 The appellants, in short, argued that s 200(3) was restrictive in character and applied to an offence contrary to s 200 irrespective of whether it was prosecuted on indictment or summarily before a Local Court. The appellants submitted that support for the contention that proceedings for the offences were statute barred was to be found in the Second Reading Speech of the Police Amendment (Miscellaneous) Bill in the Legislative Council on 14 November 2006 when the Hon. Eric Roozendaal, the Minister for Roads, and Minister assisting the Minister for Transport, said:  
     
      
       
        
        “The Bill proposes to remove the current two year statute of limitations on bribery offences under s 200 of the Police Act 1990.  
        
       
       
        
        Section 200 states that a member of NSW Police who receives or solicits any bribe is guilty of an offence. Further, a person (including a police officer) is guilty of an offence if that person gives or offers a bribe to a police officer, or for an improper purpose makes any collusive agreement with a police officer.  
        
       
       
        
        The section also provides that proceedings for an offence against the section may be taken within 2 years after the act or omission alleged to constitute the offence.  
        
       
       
        
        Prior to 1996 the offences were summary offences with a maximum penalty of 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months, or both.  
        
       
       
        
        However, in 1996 the Act was amended to provide a new maximum penalty of 200 penalty points or imprisonment for 7 years, or both, for offences under s 200. Offences under section 200 were also made indictable.  
        
       
       
        
        Normally an indictable offence does not have a restriction or limitation of time in which prosecution of that offence must be commenced. Such time limitations normally apply to summary offences. 
        
       
       
        
        As the offences under section 200 are now indictable offences, there is no justification for retaining the 2 year limitation on the commencement of prosecutions in relation to those offences. This Bill rectifies this situation.” (Hansard, Legislative Council, 14 November 2006 at 3720).  
        
       
      
    20 During oral submissions, the appellants accepted that s 200(3) of the Police Act had when enacted extended the time limitation for the prosecution of summary offences from six months to two years. The appellants submitted that when offences contrary to s 200 became indictable offences in 1996, there was no reason to have a two year limitation as there was no statute of limitations for indictable offences. Section 200(3) remained, it was said, because of legislative oversight. The effect, however, was to convert what was an extension of time to a limitation of time. As there was ambiguity, the Court was entitled to look at the interpretation that was placed upon the legislation and the reasons for the repeal of s 200(3) in the Second Reading Speech of 14 November 2006. 21 The Crown, on the other hand, contended that s 200(3) remained expansive rather than becoming restrictive, and did not apply as the offences were not being dealt with summarily. All of the offences had been prosecuted on indictment in the District Court. Although an offence contrary to s 200 had become an indictable offence after the 1996 amendments, the retention of subsection (3) enabled an election to be made pursuant to s 207(3) to have the offence dealt with in the Local Court within two years of its commission.  
     
      
    22 Before giving consideration to the competing arguments it is convenient to review the legislative history of section 200 of the Police Act.  
     
      
    The legislative history  
     
      
    23 The origin of s 200(2) of the Police Act is to be found in s 99 of the Police Service Act 1990. Section 99 stated:

        99(1) A member of the Police Service who receives or solicits any bribe, pecuniary or otherwise, is guilty of an offence. 
        
       
      
     (2) A person (including a member of the Police Service) who: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) gives, or offers or promises to give, any bribe (pecuniary or otherwise) or any other benefit to a member of the Police Service; or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) makes any collusive agreement with a member of the Police Service,  
           
          for the purpose of inducing the member to neglect his or her duty, of influencing the member in the exercise of his or her functions or of improperly taking advantage of the members position is guilty of an offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) Proceedings for an offence against this section may be taken within 2 years after the act or omission alleged to constitute the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        Maximum penalty: 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months, or both.” 
        
       
      
    24 Section 106(1) of the Police Service Act provided:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations may be dealt with summarily before a Local Court constituted by a Magistrate sitting alone.” 
        
       
      
    25 Under the Police Service Act, the offences of receiving a bribe or giving a bribe to a police officer were then summary offences the maximum punishment for which was 12 months imprisonment.  
     
      
    26 On 1 July 1993, ss 99-120 of the Police Service Act were re-numbered to ss 200-221 by the Police Service (Complaints, Discipline and Appeals) Amendment Act 1993. Sections 99 and 106 became ss 200 and 207 respectively.  
     
      
    27 Sections 200 and 207 were amended by the Police Legislation Amendment Act 1996 which commenced on 1 December 1996. Whilst subsection (3) of s 200 remained, subsection (4) was added which stated:  
     
      
       
       
       
       
       
        
        “(4) An offence under this section is an indictable offence.  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Maximum penalty: 200 penalty units or imprisonment for 7 years, or both.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    28 Subsection (1) of s 207 was amended by the addition of the words “Except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act” to the commencement of the subsection. Subsections (3) and (4) were added to the section. Section 207 was relevantly as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “( 
        1) Except where otherwise expressly provided by this Act, proceedings for an offence against this Act or the regulations may be dealt with summarily before a Local Court constituted by a Magistrate sitting alone. 
        
       
      
     … 
     
      
       
        
        (3) If an offence against this Act is an indictable offence, a Local Court may nevertheless hear and determine the proceedings in respect of such an offence if the court is satisfied that it is proper to do so and the defendant and prosecutor consent.  
        
       
       
        
        (4) If, in accordance with subsection (3), a Local Court convicts a person of such an offence, the maximum penalty that the court may impose is 50 penalty units or imprisonment for 2 years, or both.” 
        
       
      
    29 Section 207 was further amended on 7 July 2003 by the Justices Legislation Repeal and Amendment Act 2001. The words “constituted by a Magistrate sitting alone” were omitted from subsection (1). 
     
      
    30 The title to the Police Service Act 1990 was changed to the Police Act on 12 July 2002 by the Police Service Amendment (NSW Police) Act 2002.  
     
      
    31 As has been stated at [18], s 200(3) was repealed on 1 February 2007.  
     
      
       
      Dealing with the appeal  
       
      
    32 Section 56 of the Justices Act 1902 provided a time limit of six months within which proceedings for a summary offence were to be commenced unless some other time was “specially limited by the Act dealing with the matter”. It may be readily accepted that s 200(3) when originally enacted extended the time for commencing proceedings for the summary offences of receiving a bribe or giving a bribe to a police officer from six months to within two years after the act or omission alleged to constitute the offence. The critical question is whether when subsection (4) was added to s 200 by the Police Legislation Amendment Act in 1996 so that these offences became indictable, the terms of subsection (3) changed from providing an extension of the general time limit for summary proceedings (facultative) to providing a time limit for proceedings on indictment (restrictive). There is no time limit for the commencement of indictable offences unless otherwise limited by statute.  
     
      
    33 There are various principles of statutory construction which are relevant to the resolution of the question. First, there is the meaning of the word “may” in s 12 of the Interpretation Act 1987 that, if used to confer a power, indicates that the power may be exercised or not, at discretion. The second is the general principle contained in s 33 of the Interpretation Act that a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act shall be preferred to a construction that does not. The third which is found in s 34 of the Interpretation Act allows for the use of extrinsic material if the meaning of the provision to be construed is ambiguous or obscure or in its ordinary meaning leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.  
     
      
    34 The task then is to construe the relevant provisions of the Police Act in their context which includes the purpose or object underlying the Act. I begin with the word “may” which appears in s 200(3). Words of command such as “shall” or “must” are not used. The statute thereby indicates a discretion in the commencement of proceedings. I move on to consider the 1996 amendments. Subsection (4) when inserted into s 200 in 1996 promoted an offence contrary to s 200 from being summary to indictable. The maximum penalty was increased from 12 months imprisonment to 7 years imprisonment. Section 207(3) enabled a Local Court to determine the proceedings in respect of an offence against s 200 even though it was an indictable offence if the parties agreed and the Magistrate was satisfied that it was proper to do so. The maximum penalty upon summary conviction was two years imprisonment.  
     
      
    35 Extrinsic materials may be used to discover the purpose or mischief to which the legislation is directed: CIC Insurance Ltd v Bankstown Football Club Ltd (1997) 187 CLR 384; Harrison v Melhem [2008] NSWCA 67 per Spigelman CJ at [13]. The extrinsic material which is of assistance in ascertaining the purpose or mischief to which the 1996 amendments were directed is to be found in the Second Reading Speech of Mr Whelan, the Minister for Police, on 24 April 1996 when he introduced into the Legislative Assembly the Police Corruption Bill and the Police Legislation Amendment Bill. The Minister said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ongoing evidence at the royal commission demonstrates an even more serious problem in the New South Wales Police Service than was previously believed. Every available resource is need to combat corruption. The Government is committed to reducing corruption within the ranks of the Police Service as far as is humanly possible.” (Hansard, Legislative Assembly, 24 April 1996 at 444).  
        
       
      
    36 It is evident that the mischief to which these Bills were directed was serious corruption in the New South Wales Police Service which had been revealed by the Royal Commission conducted by Justice Wood. The purpose of the legislation was to introduce tough measures to reduce that corruption.  
     
      
    37 A construction of s 200(3) which embraces subsection (4) on its introduction in 1996, it seems to me, is inconsistent with the purpose of the amending legislation. How could serious corruption in the police force be said to be addressed if a time limit was imposed for offences which were made indictable when a time limit would not otherwise apply?  
     
      
    38 Upon a literal interpretation of ss 200(3) and (4), a two year time limit might be considered to apply to offences of bribery or corruption of police officers even though they had become indictable. Section 33 of the Interpretation Act allows a Court to consider the purposes of the Police Act in determining whether there is more than one possible construction: see Mills v Meeking (1990) 169 CLR 214. It is plain that the Police Act has purposes other than the establishment of the Police Service, the provision for its management and the employment of its members. As an Act usually has more than one purpose, the purpose of the particular provisions in question may appropriately be considered in their statutory context.  
     
      
    39 Section 200 is found within Part 10 which deals with offences relating to the Police Service. The section is directed at police corruption. A literal interpretation which would change subsection (3) from being facultative to restrictive does not promote the purpose of dealing with police corruption.  
     
      
    40 There is another interpretation of ss 200(3) and (4). The 1996 amendments introduced s 207(3) and (4) as well as s 200(4). Although offences contrary to s 200 became indictable, they could be dealt with summarily in accordance with s 207(3). Subsection (3) of s 200 enabled the summary disposal of an offence of bribery or corruption of a police officer if the proceedings for such an offence were commenced within two years after its commission. Considered in this way, s 200(3) remained facultative and not restrictive after the 1996 amendments. It did not operate to impose a time limit upon offences which were dealt with upon indictment. Such an interpretation promotes the purpose of the Act whereas a literal interpretation does not. Section 33 of the Interpretation Act requires that an interpretation which promotes the purpose of the Act is to be preferred to an interpretation which does not.  
     
      
    41 What then is to be made of the passage in the Second Reading Speech in 2006 which I have quoted at [19]? The limitations upon the use that can be made of the statements made by a minister in the course of a Second Reading Speech are well established. As was said by Mason P in Harrison v Melhem at [168]: 
     
      
       
        
        “On my understanding, the law is clear in Australia that a minister’s understanding of the effect of a statute or the state of the common law cannot give the Bill he or she is promoting an effect inconsistent with its terms as construed by the court.”  
        
       
      
    42 The statements made in 2006 by the Minister expressed a view of the effect of the amendments made almost a decade earlier. It appears that an assumption was made that the time limitation in s 200(3) applied to offences being prosecuted on indictment. In my view, such an assumption was erroneous as it did not take into account the purpose of the legislation. The statements made by the Minister which proceeded on an erroneous assumption do not prevail over the proper construction of the statute.  
     
      
    43 Section 200(3) was, in my opinion, unaffected by the Police Legislation Amendment Act 1996. What had been facultative did not become restrictive by the introduction of s 200(4). A time limit was not imposed upon offences contrary to s 200 which were prosecuted on indictment. As the charges the subject of the appeal were prosecuted on indictment a two year time limitation did not apply. The charges relating to the offences of 27 February 2003, 1 December 2003, 25 February 2004 and 11 October 2004 were not statute barred.  
     
      
    44 The Crown drew attention to Attorney General of The Commonwealth v Oates [1999] HCA 35; (1999) 198 CLR 162. Section 1316 of The Corporations Law, applying as part of the law of Western Australia, provided that “Despite anything in any other law, proceedings for an offence against this Law may be instituted within the period of five years after the act or omission alleged to constitute the offence …”. The respondent was charged with indictable offences against the Law, alleged to have been committed more than 5 years prior to the institution of the proceedings. It was held that s 1316 was facultative, operating to extend the twelve month period for the commencement of proceedings for offences punishable by summary conviction, and did not limit the commencement of proceedings for indictable offences. This construction of s 1316 was reached in the light of (i) the introductory words “Despite anything in any other law…” ; (ii) the word “may”; (iii) the perceived mischief that many summary offences could not be prosecuted if the twelve month period applied; and (iv) the legislative history whereby functional predecessors to s 1316 were enacted in order to deal with that mischief. Not all these matters are found in the present case, but the decision provides some support for the conclusion expressed in the preceding paragraph. 
     
      
    45 Accordingly I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Leave to appeal to Janice Seeto be granted, but the appeal  
         
        be dismissed. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Leave to appeal to Stephen Richard Evans be granted, but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The Crown presented an indictment against the applicant which pleaded two counts being: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: On 27 March 2004 at Malabar he murdered Craig Anthony Behr. 
       
       
      Count 2: On 15 March 2002 at Sydney being armed with a dangerous weapon robbed Concettino Auditore and James Rachelle of monies being the property of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. 
       
      
    2 The applicant pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. The Crown accepted the plea of guilty in full satisfaction of count 1 on the basis of “overwhelming medical evidence on both sides.” 
     
      
    3 Manslaughter is an offence contrary to s 18(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term of 25 years: s 24 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). 
     
      
    4 On 30 October 2006 the applicant pleaded guilty to count 2. That count is an offence contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term of 25 years. 
     
      
    5 The applicant was sentenced on both counts in the Supreme Court as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1: A term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 8 years commencing on 27 March 2008 and expiring on 26 March 2016 with a balance of term of 6 years commencing on 27 March 2016 and expiring on 26 March 2022. 
       
       
      Count 2: A fixed term of imprisonment for 4 years commencing 27 March 2004 and expiring on 26 March 2008. 
       
      
    6 The applicant seeks leave to raise five grounds of appeal as follows: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give sufficient regard to the sentencing principle of totality and the  
      Pearce 
       principle. 
       
       
      Ground 2: The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give sufficient regard to (a)  
      R v Henry 
      ; (b) the  
      Ellis  
      principle; and (c) delay in sentencing. 
       
       
      Ground 3: The learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give the same effect to his finding of special circumstances in relation to the accumulation of sentences and the manslaughter sentence. 
       
       
      Ground 4: The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      Ground 5: The learned sentencing judge erred in respect to the armed robbery offence, in: 
       
       
       (a) taking into account prior “criminal history”; 
       
       (b) failing to make proper allowance for the plea; 
       
        
        (c) finding that it was a “bad robbery with criminality at a significant level” and “a serious robbery that involved a high degree of criminality”; 
         
        (d) taking into account, as a matter of aggravation [at paragraph 20] that “the offence involved the threatened use of violence and the actual use of a dangerous weapon, namely a shortened 22-calibre rifle”; 
        
       
       (e) finding it was a planned offence; 
       
        
        (f) failing to take into account, pursuant to s 21A(3)(j)  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        (sic) as a matter of mitigation that the offender was not fully aware of his actions because of the offender’s mental disability. 
        
       
      
    7 As will emerge the sentencing task facing his Honour was complex and difficult. The applicant had escaped from custody when he committed the offence constituting count 2 and was in custody when he committed the offence constituting count 1. The applicant’s incarceration followed a finding of not guilty in relation to two previous armed robbery charges by reason of mental illness. The sentencing judge’s remarks were detailed. Because of the issues which his Honour was required to consider the sentence hearing occupied a number of days. His Honour both carefully analysed the relevant evidence and considered the detailed submissions made on the applicant’s behalf. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    8 The parties agreed the facts in relation to the armed robbery which his Honour summarised in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “About 9.30am on Friday the 15th of March 2002 the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, located on the corner of Liverpool and Castlereagh Streets, Sydney, opened for trading. Approximately 8 people were standing outside the building waiting for the bank to open. In that group was the offender.  
         
         
        When the doors were unlocked and opened by a staff member of the bank, the offender pushed past another customer and walked towards the middle of the counter area of the bank. He approached a bank employee, Nina Vukasinovic, whilst holding a shortened firearm and said “I  
        want all your money now 
        ”. The offender turned and faced the waiting customers and said to get back. The offender shouted “ 
        This is a fucking robbery 
        ”. Vukasinovic ran from the teller area towards the back of the bank. 
         
         
        The offender said “ 
        Hurry up 
        ” a number of times. Another employee of the bank, Concettino Auditore, walked over to where the offender was standing in an attempt to see what the offender wanted. At this stage Auditore was unaware of the situation. A clear dividing screen separated the two. As Auditore got closer to the offender, Auditore entered the teller slot in front of the offender and picked up a plastic bag that the offender had placed on the counter area of the bank. Auditore saw the offender holding and pointing a shortened sawn off firearm at him. The offender told Auditore to take the bag and said “ 
        Hurry up and get me some money 
        ”. 
         
         
        Auditore started to take money from the tellers’ drawer and place it in the plastic bag that the offender had placed on the counter. While doing this Auditore heard the offender say “ 
        Hurry up you have 30 seconds and don’t fuck me around 
        ”. While Auditore filled the bag the offender instructed the other customers to get along a sidewall while pointing the firearm in their direction. He then stated that if anyone did anything stupid, he would fire the gun. 
         
         
        Once Auditore had finished removing the money from the drawer, the offender demanded more money from underneath the counter. This was money that was on hand and was contained in the ‘Under Counter Unit’ or UCU, a lockable cabinet that contains a substantial amount of currency. Auditore attempted to open the UCU belonging to the teller slot he was standing in, however it failed to open. 
         
         
        Auditore walked over to his allocated teller slot and attempted to open that UCU, at which point the offender said “ 
        You’ve got 10 seconds 
        ” while pointing the firearm at Auditore. 
         
         
        Auditore requested someone to help him load money into the plastic bag. Another Bank employee, James Rachelle, loaded money in the bag and during this process the accused said: “ 
        Hurry up, you’ve got 20 seconds, if you don’t fucken move, I’ll jump the counter and turn this place into a hostage situation, I am not kidding 
        ”. Rachelle and Auditore finished loading money into the plastic bag. The offender reached through the screen and took the plastic bag full on money and said “ 
        Thank you 
        ”. 
         
         
        The offender left the bank and walked west along Liverpool Street. Numerous Police attended the surrounding area, but failed to locate the accused. 
         
         
        During the robbery the Banks’ security alarm had been activated together with a number of security cameras. These photographs captured a number of images. These images clearly depict the offender in possession of a shortened firearm and holding a plastic bag during the robbery. 
         
         
        A detailed check of money stolen from the Commonwealth Bank totalled, as I have said, $18,705 in Australian currency. 
         
         
        On Wednesday 16 July 2003 Detective Inspector Jacob of the State Crime Command Homicide Squad met with the offender and during that conversation the offender disclosed to Detective Inspector Jacob that he was responsible for the robbery at the Commonwealth Bank on the 15 March 2002. 
         
         
        On Wednesday 21 January 2004 the offender was formally interviewed by Robbery and Serious Crime Squad Detectives. During that interview the offender made full admissions to the robbery at the Commonwealth Bank. The offender also adopted the conversation he had with Detective Inspector Jacob on the 16 July 2003. The offender stated that he used the money to live. He stated that he went on a trip to Victoria and Queensland and purchased clothing. He added that the money lasted about 9 days and he did not use it to purchase drugs or alcohol. 
         
         
        During the commission of the offence a number of bank employees and members of the public suffered from shock and consequently have been traumatised by that fact that a firearm was pointed at them. 
        
       
      
    9 The facts with respect to the death of Craig Behr were agreed in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “About 10.30am on Saturday 27 March 2004 the deceased, was moved to cell 20 of Long Bay Prison Hospital to be in the company of another inmate. The deceased was placed in cell 20 with the offender. 
         
          
         
        The deceased and the offender had previously shared a cell together with no problems. 
         
         
        About 11.45am the lunchtime ‘lockdown’ occurred and all inmates were returned to their cells. The deceased was locked into cell 20 with the offender. There were no other inmates in the cell. 
         
         
        The adjoining cell, containing inmate Johannes Schmidt, was separated by an interconnecting door. There is a space under this door, which allowed Schmidt to see into cell 20 containing the offender and the deceased. 
         
         
        About 12.15pm a number of inmates heard screaming coming from cell 20. Schmidt heard what he believed sounded like a body hitting the floor of the cell and the sound of a bed banging. Schmidt attempted to raise the alarm on the Emergency Cell Call System at about 12.15pm. At about 12.21pm Schmidt attempted to raise the alarm for a second time. There was no response to either call.  
         
         
        At about 12.28pm Schmidt heard what he believed to be the sound of a body being moved.  
         
         
        At 12.35pm Corrective Services Officers Keith Smith and Brian Corlis received a call regarding an emergency in cell 20. Smith and Corlis immediately attended cell 20 and opened the door. The Officers observed the offender standing in front of the deceased.  
         
         
        The offender said “Get me out, get me out. I’ve got to get out of here.” 
         
         
        The offender attempted to push past the two officers. The officers saw the deceased lying on the floor of the cell with blood and vomit around his head. 
         
         
        The offender was removed from cell 20 and placed in an adjoining cell. The Officers attempted to revive the deceased but were unsuccessful. 
         
         
        Police were contacted and attended the Long Bay Prison Hospital a short time later. 
         
         
        The offender had blood on his hands, legs, clothing and shoes. 
         
         
        The offender was conveyed to Maroubra Police Station where he was interviewed but declined to say anything. After the interview the offender was returned to the dock where he said to Detective Sergeant Davies “ 
        Sorry about the interview but I didn’t want to say anything in front of him 
        .” When asked who he meant the offender said “ 
        The guard 
        .”  
         
         
        He then said: - 
         
         
          
          ‘I didn’t want to kill him man, I didn’t even know him. I’m not schizo but I do have a mental problem. I’m homicidal, I’ve told them that for days. Then they tell me this morning that they’re putting this guy with me and I begged them not to but they said they were going to. I told them I’ll kill him but they just said ‘you’re full of shit’. So about 11.30 they put us together and by 12.30 he’s dead. I didn’t want to do it, I know he’s got a mum and dad and his mum is probably crying now. I know what it’s like to lose someone, I lost my dad.’  
          
         
         
        The offender was asked what the deceased had done to provoke him and he replied “ 
        Nothing 
        .” He was then asked how he had killed the deceased and the offender responded “ 
        I kicked him to death 
        .” 
         
         
        On Sunday 28 March 2004 Dr Paul Botterill performed a post mortem on the deceased. Dr Botterill found that the deceased could have died from a blow to the head or from asphyxiation caused by vomit in his airways. 
         
         
        On Thursday 1 April 2004 the offender was interviewed at Maroubra Police Station. He stated that after he and the deceased had lunch he punched and kicked the deceased and then stood at the back of the cell. The offender said that he saw the deceased lying on the floor with blood and vomit on his face. He said that he activated the emergency alarm so that he could get out of the cell. 
         
         
        During the interview the offender adopted the conversation with Detective Sergeant Davies in the dock at Maroubra Police Station on the 27 March 2004.” 
         
        
       
       
      Some remarks of the sentencing judge 
       
      
    10 His Honour described the robbery as a “bad robbery”. Because of the threatened use of violence and the actual use of a dangerous weapon his Honour concluded that the criminality was at a significant level. His Honour said that there were aggravating features: “the victims, as bank tellers going about their daily task, were in a vulnerable position. The offence involved more than one victim and was, to a degree, a planned offence. As the agreed facts indicate, a number of bank employees and members of the public suffered from shock as a consequence.” 
     
      
    11 With respect to the manslaughter offence his Honour identified that it was necessary to determine the offender’s mental state at the time of the death of Mr Behr. His Honour also believed it necessary to assess the current and future dangerousness of the applicant. There was a suggestion in the applicant’s evidence on sentence that he had been subjected to a sexual threat from Mr Behr. His Honour believed it necessary to make findings in relation to that matter. 
     
      
    12 The evidence in relation to the applicant’s mental state was complex. Although there was evidence which may have justified a diagnosis of schizophrenia, the psychiatrists, Dr Allnutt and Dr Westmore rejected this diagnosis and agreed that at the time of the killing the applicant was affected by a substantial impairment of his ability to control his urges and actions. His Honour found that both doctors accepted that the applicant had some ability to understand the nature and quality of his actions and, in particular, that they were wrong. His Honour concluded that the applicant is a very disturbed young man with complex medical problems and displays the characteristics of a “paranoid and persecuted man.” 
     
      
    13 Although the applicant asserted that Mr Behr had made a sexual advance to him and may have sexually assaulted him his Honour rejected that suggestion. His Honour’s careful analysis of the evidence clearly supports that finding. 
     
      
    14 His Honour recognised the difficulties involved in the sentencing task. In his remarks he firstly gave detailed consideration to the robbery offence. Although the applicant pleaded guilty this did not occur until 30 October 2006. Although the applicant had admitted his involvement in the offence at a much earlier time his Honour concluded that the delay in entering a plea was due to consideration by his advisers as to whether the robbery charge would be resisted having regard to a potential claim of mental illness. For these reasons his Honour concluded that although the applicant was entitled to a discount for his plea it should be at the low end of the available range. 
     
      
    15 The applicant voluntarily disclosed that he had committed the robbery. Accordingly he was entitled to a further discount for his voluntary disclosure (see R v Ellis (1986) 6 NSWLR 603). His Honour concluded that this discount should be reasonably generous. He ultimately determined to allow a discount of 25% in recognition of both the plea and the disclosure of the offence to the authorities.  
     
      
    16 His Honour considered the applicant’s criminal history. Of concern were the two previous charges of robbery with a dangerous weapon. His Honour said (at [21]-[22]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender has a reasonably extensive criminal history although the only matters that are particularly relevant for this offence relate to earlier charges he faced in January 2001 and November 2002. On 29 January 2001, the offender, facing a charge of robbery with a dangerous weapon, was found not guilty at trial by reason of mental illness by Shillington DCJ. The offender was referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. On 12 November 2002, the offender, again charged with robbery with a dangerous weapon, was, once again found not guilty at trial by reason of mental illness. The Judge in this trial was Tupman DCJ. It is the fact, of course, that these findings are not, strictly speaking, part of the offender’s criminal record. They do however, have a limited relevance. 
         
         
        I should, at the outset, make it clear that while I have regard to the offender’s criminal antecedents, I do not do so to impose punishment upon the offender in relation to any of those earlier matters. I take them into account, but only for the limited purpose of noting that the instant offence is not an uncharacteristic aberration. Rather it shows in this area, an attitude of continuing disobedience of the law. The mental illness findings, on the two occasions in the District Court, have some impact, however, on the present sentencing process. I shall of course, have more to say about the offender’s mental status when I come to consider the manslaughter charge. As will become apparent, the offender has suffered from an underlying chronic psychotic disorder for many years and, although this did not appear to impact on the commission of the Commonwealth Bank robbery on 15 March 2002, there is a possibility that the offender’s persistent mental condition was, in general terms, operative at the time.” 
        
       
      
    17 His Honour recognised that the applicant’s mental illness reduced the suitability of his sentence as a vehicle for general deterrence. However, he found that there was a need to impose a sentence which reflected an element of personal deterrence. His Honour found that the applicant had expressed remorse although he appears to have been sceptical about the extent to which there was a genuine recognition of his offending conduct. 
     
      
    18 His Honour concluded that because the applicant was to be sentenced for the armed robbery and for the more serious charge of manslaughter which raised questions of accumulation, it was appropriate to impose a fixed term of imprisonment for the robbery offence. His Honour determined that term as being the equivalent of the non-parole period that would have been appropriate if other than a fixed term had been imposed. The parties agreed that the sentence should be backdated to 27 March 2004, being the time at which, although a forensic patient, was the date he should be regarded as being held in custody in relation to the manslaughter charge. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “From a practical point of view, it is, in my opinion, a more satisfactory method of structuring the sentence by placing the fixed term sentence below or beneath the sentence for manslaughter and then later to consider questions of accumulation or concurrence. In addition, the manslaughter sentence is for a more serious crime and will involve the selection of a non-parole period and a balance of term. It is for those reasons that I will first impose the fixed term sentence and backdate it to the agreed date for commencement of the overall sentence, namely 27 March 2004.” 
        
       
      
    19 In relation to the offence of manslaughter his Honour recognised the wide variety of sentences which have been imposed for such an offence. His Honour was mindful of the remarks of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Carlson (unreported, NSWSC, 16 October 1995) where his Honour said that where a conviction for manslaughter is based upon the partial defence of substantial impairment a sentence at the higher end of the range will normally be appropriate. However, his Honour emphasised that the sentence for any particular manslaughter must depend upon the facts of the particular case. 
     
      
    20 With respect to the applicant’s medical condition the sentencing judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        107 Secondly, the Crown argued that the offender’s capacity to understand events, and his ability to judge whether his actions were right or wrong were not impaired by his mental illness. The Crown submitted that the impairment impinged upon his capacity to control his homicidal urges. For that reason, it was submitted that the impairment, although substantial, was not as serious, for the purposes of gauging the level of culpability, as other types of impairment.  
         
         
        108 In general terms, I accept this submission. It is necessary to add that the substantial impairment suffered by the offender has already been taken into account in relation to reducing the offence from murder to manslaughter. It is not inappropriate, however, to have regard to the nature of that impairment when assessing the criminality of the manslaughter offence itself. It is necessary to take special care not to “double count” the impact of the substantial impairment. But, as I have said, it is not inappropriate in a particular case, to examine the mental illness or disorder for the further purpose I have mentioned. 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour identified the principles relevant when an offender who is suffering from mental illness is sentenced (see R v Engert (1996) 84 A Crim R 67 at [68], R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228, R v Pham [2005] NSWCCA 314). 
     
      
    22 His Honour then said at ([112]): 
     
      
       
        
        “There are three ways in which mental illness may be relevant in sentencing so as to moderate the sentence otherwise to be imposed. First, where mental illness contributes to the commission of the offence in a material way, the offender’s moral culpability may be reduced. Secondly, mental illness may render the offender an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration which would otherwise be of significance. Thirdly, a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person.” 
         
        
       
      
    23 His Honour also recognised that in cases involving mental illness there was a need to evaluate the danger which an offender presents to the community. His Honour said (at [113]-[114]): 
     
      
       
        
        “On the other hand, there is a countervailing consideration, namely the need in cases involving mental illness, to evaluate the danger which the offender presents to the community. This entails consideration of the need for special deterrence. As the majority said in  
        Veen (No 2) 
         at 476: - 
         
         
          
          “A mental abnormality which makes an offender a danger to society when he is at large but which diminishes his moral culpability for a particular crime is a factor which has two countervailing effects: one which tends towards a longer custodial sentence, the other towards a shorter.” 
          
         
         
        As Gleeson CJ said in  
        R v Engert 
         at 68: - 
         
         
          
          “In the case of a particular offender, an aspect of the case which might mean the deterrence of others is of lesser importance, might, at the same time, mean that the protection of society is of greater importance. …In a particular case, a feature which lessens what might otherwise be the importance of general deterrence might, at the same time, increase the importance of deterrence of the offender.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    24 His Honour concluded that these principles had particular significance in the case of the applicant. His Honour recognised that it was because of his psychotic disorder and personality difficulties that the applicant found it difficult to control his “homicidal urges”. His Honour said (at [115]-[116]):  
     
      
       
        
        “The recognition of this aspect requires the moderation of the level of criminal culpability in the present case. That moderation is, however, offset to a degree by the fact that the offender recognised the wrongfulness of his actions and, indeed, recognised a dangerousness of the urge to kill.  
        
       
       
        
        At the same time, the very condition that diminished the offender’s capacity for self control plainly increases the need for protection of the public, including those persons with whom the offender is likely to come into contact during his time in custody or perhaps, on release.” 
        
       
      
    25 His Honour accepted that the applicant was entitled to a discount for the utilitarian value of his plea. That plea was only entered at the outset of the trial for murder. Accordingly, it could not justify a discount greater than 10%. His Honour detected very little remorse or contrition on the part of the applicant for his killing and concluded that the applicant had little insight into his actions. 
     
      
       
      Ground One: 
       
      
    26 The applicant submitted that his Honour had failed to have appropriate regard to principles of totality. Consideration of his Honour’s remarks confirm that this submission should be rejected. His Honour said (at [102]-[104]): 
     
      
       
        
        “I have decided that, because the offender comes for sentence in relation to the more serious charge of manslaughter as well, and because questions of accumulation will and do inevitably arise, a fixed term of imprisonment should be imposed for the present offence. I propose to impose, after discount, a sentence of four years fixed term of imprisonment for this offence and to backdate it to 27 March 2004. The term is intended to be the equivalent of the appropriate non-parole period that would have been applicable if other than a fixed term had been imposed. 
         
         
        Strictly speaking, this back dating process is brought about by the situation, as is agreed between the parties, that the offender, although remaining a forensic patient at the time, might notionally be regarded as having been held in custody in relation to the manslaughter charge from that day onwards. By contrast, although the offender was formally interviewed in relation to the robbery in January 2004, it does not appear that the offender was held in custody (or even in notional custody) as from that date in connection with the robbery offence.  
         
         
        From a practical point of view, it is, in my opinion, a more satisfactory method of structuring the sentence by placing the fixed term sentence below or beneath the sentence for manslaughter and then later to consider questions of accumulation or concurrence. In addition, the manslaughter sentence is for a more serious crime and will involve the selection of a non-parole period and a balance of term. It is for those reasons that I will first impose the fixed term sentence and backdate it to the agreed date for commencement of the overall sentence, namely 27 March 2004.” 
        
       
      
    27 It is apparent that his Honour was conscious of the fact that he was sentencing the applicant for two offences. His Honour expressly acknowledged the need to consider questions of accumulation or concurrence. By ultimately structuring the sentences as he did his Honour endeavoured to ensure that the overall sentence adequately reflected the total criminality involved.  
     
      
    28 The applicant further submitted that his Honour had not followed the sentencing process required by the High Court in Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 160 at [45]. I reject this submission. His Honour was clear in his discussion of the matters relevant to the sentence for each offence. Furthermore, he identified the sentence appropriate for each offence and then dealt with the issue of totality by structuring the sentences to be cumulative and providing a fixed term for the armed robbery offence. 
     
      
    29 To my mind his Honour appropriately addressed the principles in Pearce. 
     
      
    30 I reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two 
       
      
    31 The applicant submitted that his Honour had failed to appropriately consider the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and the judgment in Ellis [17] and did not sufficiently recognise the delay in the sentencing of the applicant. 
     
      
    32 In my judgment the submissions must be rejected.  
     
      
    33 The guideline judgment in Henry was concerned with an offence of armed robbery contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act which carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. Count 2 was an offence of aggravated armed robbery in contravention of s 97(2) which carries a maximum penalty of 25 years. The present robbery offence was more serious than the offence contemplated in Henry. The applicant threatened a high level of violence brandishing a weapon and threatening to shoot persons in the bank and to turn “this place into a hostage situation.” There were multiple victims and the amount of money taken was not small. 
     
      
    34 His Honour concluded that the plea entered in relation to the armed robbery count was entered at a relatively late stage. He concluded that a discount toward the bottom of the range was appropriate. With respect to the Ellis discount his Honour was satisfied that a reasonably significant discount was appropriate. For both the plea and Ellis considerations his Honour provided a total discount of 25%. Although a greater discount could have been provided I am not persuaded that the discount his Honour determined was erroneous. If, as would seem appropriate his Honour allowed only 10% for the utilitarian value of the plea a discount of 15% for brining the robbery to the attention of the authorities was not beyond the available range: (Ryan v The Queen (2001) 206 CLR 287; R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349; O’Keefe v R (1992) 60 A Crim R 201; Irwin v R [2008] NSWCCA 7). 
     
      
    35 The Crown does not dispute that there was a significant delay between the time of the commission of the robbery offence and when the applicant was sentenced. The applicant committed the offence on 15 March 2002 but did not disclose the matter until 16 July 2003. It was not until 21 January 2004 that the applicant was interviewed and charged. He did not immediately plead guilty and was committed to the District Court for trial. It was not until shortly before 30 October 2006 that the applicant communicated an intention to plead guilty to this count. Accordingly there was a period between July 2003 and January 2004 where there was a delay which was not attributable to the applicant. During that period the applicant was being held in custody. In these circumstances the Crown submitted that considerations of delay were not material to the appropriate sentence. Most of the delay was occasioned by the fact that the applicant did not acknowledge his guilt. There was a period of six months when no action was taken although he had acknowledged his guilt. However, during this time he was being held in custody for other offences and I am not persuaded that a lesser sentence was required by reason of this delay. 
     
      
       
      Ground three 
       
      
    36 When considering the appropriate sentence for the manslaughter offence the sentencing judge found that there were special circumstances. Having determined that a fixed term was the appropriate sentence for the armed robbery offence no question of special circumstances could arise for that matter. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        129 The offender, however, is entitled to the recognition of special circumstances. There are two reasons for this. The first is the cumulative structure of the two sentences. The second relates to his mental illness. In my opinion, the offender should be encouraged to co-operate with his clinicians and medical specialists. He should be encouraged to be frank and truthful in his dealings with them, and to take medication and other treatment, if prescribed. A principal reason for the finding of special circumstances is the need for the offender to be encouraged to realise that his co-operation, in the process of medical rehabilitation, may yield him the prospect of earlier conditional release than would otherwise have been the case. 
        
       
      
    37 The portion of the non-parole period of the total term for the manslaughter offence was 57%, clearly a recognition of the finding of special circumstances. However, the applicant complains that when considered as a proportion of the total effective non-parole period the proportion is 66%. 
     
      
    38 It is apparent from his Honour’s careful consideration of the length of the individual sentences and the overall term that he intended by his finding of special circumstances to adjust the ratio between the parole and non-parole periods in relation to the sentence for the manslaughter offence. His Honour was concerned to ensure that, if released, the applicant would serve an appropriate period under supervision. However, to achieve this result a finding of special circumstances for the manslaughter offence was necessary. But this does not mean that the ratio between the periods of non-parole and parole required further adjustment. His Honour’s concern was to impose an appropriate period of supervised release which the total sentence provided.  
     
      
       
      Ground four 
       
      
    39 I will consider this ground after considering ground five. 
     
      
       
      Ground five 
       
      
    40 Under this ground the applicant raises a number of discrete issues. 
     
      
    41 The sentencing judge described the applicant as having a reasonably extensive criminal history. Amongst other matters his Honour was referring to two previous offences of armed robbery in respect of which there had been special verdicts of not guilty by reason of mental illness. Although a conviction is not recorded a special verdict involves a finding that the offender has carried out the actus reus of the relevant offence. The sentencing judge recognised that the findings were not strictly part of the applicant’s criminal record. However, he indicated that he would have regard to them although he said they “had limited relevance” (see [16] above). 
     
      
    42 The error of which the applicant complains is the finding by his Honour that the armed robbery offence was not an uncharacteristic aberration and showed an attitude of disobedience to the law. It was submitted that because the finding assumed that not only did the applicant commit the actus reus of a particular offence but the necessary mens rea was present. Because a special verdict involves a finding of mental illness it was submitted that his Honour’s conclusion was not open. 
     
      
    43 In my judgment this submission should be accepted. As would be the case in respect of a child lacking legal capacity to commit a crime an act committed by a person whilst lacking the mental capacity to commit a crime should not be considered part of his criminal history or reflective of his or her attitude toward obedience to the law. Only offences of which a person has been convicted are relevant to a later sentencing task. The decision in R v Price [2005] NSWCCA 285 is instructive. In that case although the offender was found guilty a conviction was not entered the offender being given the benefit of s 10 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. This Court held that prior offending was not relevant to a later sentencing process. The present case is analogous. 
     
      
    44 The applicant submitted that the sentencing judge had not made proper allowance for the plea of guilty. It was submitted that the applicant’s mental problems which were responsible for the delay in the plea should have been taken into account. A discount for a plea is provided in recognition of its utilitarian value: R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383; R v Stambolis [2006] NSWCCA 56; (2006) 160 A Crim R 510. Attention should be focused on the real utilitarian value of the plea. If, as happened in the present case, that value is lessened because of the actions of an offender and/or his advisors the discount will usually be reduced. There will be many reasons why a plea is delayed. There may be a legitimate need to consider the offender’s position and give him or her appropriate advice before the plea is entered. This was one such circumstance. However, that circumstance does not justify a greater discount. The applicant’s mental condition was of course relevant to the need for the sentence to provide for general deterrence (see [54] below). 
     
      
    45 The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in finding that it was “a bad robbery” and a robbery with “criminality at a significant level” or one that “involved a high degree of criminality.” It was submitted that the appropriate finding was that this was “almost a standard type” of robbery. 
     
      
    46 I reject this submission. The words chosen to describe the criminality of a particular offence may vary. Consistency of language may not always be possible. However, in this case the applicant carried a gun, repeatedly threatened to use it, put a number of persons in fear and stole a significant amount of money. His Honour’s description that the robbery involved a high degree of criminality was not inappropriate. Having regard to the maximum penalty for the offence (25 years imprisonment) the sentence which his Honour imposed could not be criticised as being beyond the available range. 
     
      
    47 A further criticism of the sentencing judge was that he had regard to the threatened use of violence and the actual use of a dangerous weapon as matters of aggravation. It was submitted these are common incidents of an armed robbery and could not be further taken into account under s 21 of the Crimes (Sentencing) Act (see s 21A(2); R v Williams [2005] NSWCCA 99; R v Johnson [2005] NSWCCA 186; R v Ibrahimi [2005] NSWCCA 43; R v House [2005] NSWCCA 88; R v Elyard [2006] NSWCCA 43. 
     
      
    48 There is no substance in this submission. His Honour found that the offence itself involved the threatened use of violence and the actual use of a dangerous weapon. He then proceeded to separately determine the aggravating features. He did not repeat a reference to violence or the use of a dangerous weapon. 
     
      
    49 It was submitted that his Honour erred in finding that the armed robbery was a planned offence. This submission must also be rejected. There was evidence before the sentencing judge from the applicant’s ERISP. When interviewed he admitted that he had gone to the bank on the preceding Wednesday to examine it and had determined upon the robbery after establishing that there were no significant security screens. He received the firearm from a relative at whose behest he committed the robbery. He carried the firearm in a backpack and drove his own motorbike to the scene. He parked the bike some distance away to enable his escape to go unchecked. These circumstances justified a finding that the offence was “to a degree a planned offence”. It was certainly not spontaneous.  
     
      
    50 The applicant complained that this Honour failed to take into account as a matter of mitigation that the applicant was not fully aware of his actions because of mental instability (s 21A(3)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). 
     
      
    51 It is apparent both from the planning of the robbery and his actions during it that the applicant was well aware of his actions. No doubt his mental instability is related to his preparedness to break the law and at the same time threaten violence to others. However, there was no question that he appreciated that what he was doing was wrong and a breach of the law. 
     
      
    52 In his remarks on sentence his Honour commented upon the applicant’s underlying chronic psychotic disorder and said that although this did not appear to impact on the commission of the Commonwealth Bank robbery on 15 March 2002 there is a possibility that the offender’s persistent mental condition was, in general terms, operative at the time. 
     
      
    53 Later, in his remarks his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the other hand, it is impossible to put to one side altogether the history of the offender’s mental illness. This matter must diminish or at least reduce, the suitability of the offender as a vehicle for general deterrence. There is a need, however, to insist upon a sentence which reflects an element of personal deterrence in the area of armed robbery.” 
        
       
      
    54 The applicant pleaded guilty to the robbery offence and thereby acknowledged that he had the requisite mens rea. His Honour’s identification of the applicant’s mental illness and its impact upon the sentencing process was entirely appropriate. The applicant emphasised that the robbery was committed when the offender had escaped from Kenmore Hospital where he had been an inmate pending a determination of the Mental Health Tribunal. When captured he was initially diagnosed as suffering from schizophrenia. Accepting that this diagnosis was at that time appropriate his Honour nevertheless had regard to the evidence before him as to the applicant’s mental condition at the time of the offence and had appropriate regard to its significance when determining the ultimate sentence. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 
       
      
    55 The applicant has identified only one problem in an otherwise complex sentencing task carried out by his Honour with great care. That issue, the matter of prior offending was, to his Honour, of only “limited relevance”. Having regard to the objective seriousness of both offences and the various aggravating and mitigating matters to which his Honour had regard and, in particular, allowing appropriate weight for the applicant’s mental health problems, I am not persuaded that the sentences imposed were inappropriate. I am not satisfied that some other less severe sentence (whether as to the full term or the non-parole period) was warranted in law and should have been passed: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912; R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704.  
     
      
    56 Although I would grant leave to appeal the appeal should be dismissed.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: The offender was employed as a loss prevention officer. On 5 December 2006 he was working in the Coles Supermarket at Merrylands. He was interested in the store manager, JF. When he had previously worked in the store he had made comments to her such as, “You’ve got a pretty face. You’ve got a beautiful smile,” and things of that nature. JF did not encourage him but the offender would not take the hint. 2 On 5 December his attentions persisted. They became more explicit. He said to her that he just wanted to spend ten minutes with her and that he really liked her. JF still did not encourage him. She tried to brush him off. She was embarrassed by his intentions. 3 Part of her job involved faxing some papers prepared by the offender. Together they walked up to the manager’s office and as they did so the offender again said, “I just want to spend ten minutes with you.” JF replied bluntly, “no, it’s not going to happen.” Once they got to the manager’s office, JF turned her attention to the computer. 4 She needed to record some price changes which had been made in order to ensure that customers were not charged more than they should have been. While she was doing this, the offender closed the door. He began to ask JF why she would not go out with him. He said, “I just want to kiss you” and before JF knew what was happening, he had forced himself onto her and begun kissing her. She pushed him off but he kissed her a second time. He then began to put his hand down her shirt and grabbed her breast. He began to suck it. That action formed the basis of the first count on the indictment, an offence of indecent assault. JF was trying to resist but she was seated and he was standing up over her. He was also much stronger than she was. He then grabbed her hand and placed it on his penis on the outside of his pants. She could feel that he had an erection. That action of the offender forms the basis of the second count on the indictment, also an offence of indecent assault. 5 He then said, “This won’t take long.” He had previously exposed his penis. He then grabbed JF’s head and forced her mouth onto his exposed penis and forced her to give him oral sex. After a short time when he said that he was about to ejaculate, JF managed to push him away so that his penis came out of her mouth. He then said, “Watch. Watch,” and masturbated in front of her before ejaculating onto the floor of the manager’s office. This was the basis of the third count on the indictment, an offence of sexual intercourse without consent. It is an offence which carries with it a standard non-parole period of seven years.6 JF said that after these three offences she was in a state of shock. She went into a different office where the fax machine was and faxed off the papers that the offender had asked her to. Closed-circuit television footage showed what she did in the room. I should say there was no closed-circuit television footage in the manger’s office. In the fax room she is seen to place her head in her hands, clearly exhibiting distress at what had just happened to her. She later attempted to contact her friend before contacting her superiors at Coles and eventually the police. 7 The offender pleaded not guilty to the three counts on the indictment but a jury found him guilty after a relatively short trial. He did not deny that the sexual activity occurred but said that it was all consensual. Indeed, it was his version as told to police in the electronically recorded interview that JF has effectively seduced him. He said that he was only interested in having his documents faxed off, but that once JF started to seduce him, he became excited and did what JF wanted him to. The jury clearly rejected that version of events, finding beyond reasonable doubt that the circumstances in which the sexual activity took place were as the complainant described. 8 These were serious offences. The offender was given not the slightest reason to think that the complainant might either be romantically or sexually interested in him, but he seems not to have cared, deciding to indecently touch JF, then forcing her to perform oral sex upon him despite her making it clear that she did not want that to happen.9 The offender was born in Iraq in July 1972. His father died when he was five years of age. Most of Mr Alseedi’s family remain back in Iraq. His mother lives with one of his brothers. He also has a sister and another brother living in Iraq. Their situation was the subject of some evidence before me. The offender was educated in Iraq but decided to leave the country once the Iraq-Kuwaiti war started. He was deeply frightened, not unnaturally, of the prospect of being killed in that war and so he ran away.10 He went to Iran for a number of years where he worked selling fruit. He then decided to come to Australia. He had wanted to do this for some time. He went to Malaysia and then to Indonesia before eventually arriving in Western Australia in 1999. He worked in Derby and then Perth before moving to Sydney where he worked firstly as a waterproofer and then as a security guard. It was his work as a security guard which led to him committing the offences for which I must sentence him.11 The offender has a relatively minor criminal history. He was dealt with for common assault in 2002 and placed on a s 9 bond for twelve months. Also appearing on his criminal history is an offence of escaping lawful immigration detention. As is well known, escapes can vary in their objective gravity. The fact that the sentence imposed on the offender was a relatively small one suggests that his version of the offence was likely to be true. He said that, he and other refugees simply walked out of their detention centre and sat down waiting for reporters to arrive so that they could protest against their treatment; technically an escape but one which is not of great moment in the circumstances that now present themselves in relation to the sentencing of the offender for these offences.12 The offender has a fiancée, Ms Khoury, who gave evidence to me today. They have been engaged since 2006. The offender also is supported by a number of people in the community. A number of references were tendered before me attesting to his qualities and many people have attended court today to support him. He is fortunate that he receives visits from a number of these people whilst in custody.13 The offender is doing his time in custody particularly hard. He is significantly depressed and anxious about spending time in custody. He was regularly in tears in the witness box when giving evidence before me today. I am satisfied that he is affected by his conditions of custody much more so than most other prisoners. He is currently on protection. It cannot be assumed, however, that that will continue or that, if it does, the conditions of custody will be worse than in the general prison population. Indeed the evidence is that his present conditions of custody are no worse than those of the general prison population. There is no evidence that he will continue to remain in protection if his conditions of custody do become harder than in the general prison population.14 I mentioned before that the circumstances of the offender’s family in Iraq received some attention during the sentencing submissions today. His mother has recently suffered a heart attack I am told and has lost her sight in one eye. The offender was also for many years regularly sending money back to Iraq, comparatively small amounts in Australia but these were significant amounts in Iraq and able to benefit his many family members. 15 It was submitted by Mr Trevallion that the hardship which would be occasioned to the offender’s family through him being unable to send money back to Iraq was exceptional. I do not accept that that is the case. It is unfortunately commonplace for breadwinners to go to gaol and their dependents to therefore suffer. It is perhaps unusual that these dependents are in Iraq and that there is no formal system of social security available to assist in their welfare but that does not mean that they will suffer significantly. 16 Indeed, to their great credit Mr Alseedi’s community have clubbed together to provide a significant amount of money to provide to the offender’s mother so that she can have an operation. It is true, as Mr Trevallion says that it is much more likely that a relative will send money to a person in need in Iraq than strangers, but when I have to assess whether the hardship to be suffered by those left in Iraq is exceptional I must of course necessarily take into account that others appear to have stepped into the breach somewhat, to ensure that the family back in Iraq do not suffer unduly. In any case I do note that some members of the family are working. I note also that there was no real evidence as to any concrete hardship that would be suffered by any member of the family in the absence of the regular payments which had been made by the offender.17 A victim impact statement was tendered to me. It revealed the significant effects that had been felt by JF as a result of the sexual assaults on her. Those effects are long lasting and significant. They are precisely what can be expected from serious offences such as this. The effects that are felt by victims of sexual assault are one of the reasons that the court treats very seriously those who sexually violate others. I do not regard the hardship felt by JF as an aggravating feature because it appears to me to be exactly what can be expected from serious misconduct such as this. 18 There are many circumstances of this offence which are neutral in terms of whether they are mitigating or aggravating features. For example, it is not an aggravating feature that the offence was planned but nor has it been established that it was a mitigating feature that it was planned. There appears to have been some level of planning but not sufficient to justify the aggravating feature. The offender does not have a significant record of previous convictions; that is a mitigating factor. The fact that he does have previous convictions does not aggravate the matter at all. As I have indicated they were for relatively minor offences.19 It is difficult to find that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and, in fact, I cannot make that finding. The most obvious impediment to that finding being made is that the offender continues to maintain his innocence. His failure to admit his guilt suggests that nothing, apart of course from the sentence I must impose upon him, will prevent him from in future doing something similar to what he has done in the past.20 I did mention that the offence of sexual intercourse without consent carries a standard non-parole period of seven years. On occasions courts have attempted to categorise various forms of sexual intercourse with suggestions occasionally being made that some forms of sexual intercourse are necessarily less serious than other forms of sexual intercourse. However those remarks do not appear to have been followed in other cases. 21 I am satisfied that the appropriate way of looking at the various forms of sexual intercourse is not to apply blanket determinations that one form is always more serious than another, but to look at all the circumstances in which the particular form of intercourse occurs. Thus for example whilst it may be thought that digital penetration will usually be less serious than other forms of sexual intercourse, that would not automatically be the case. In order to decide the seriousness of a particular act of intercourse much more needs to be looked at than the form the intercourse takes. 22 In this case, as I mentioned, the form of intercourse was fellatio. I take into account that the penetration of JF’s mouth by the accused’s penis was relatively quick and that he did not ejaculate in her mouth. He did however physically force JF to perform the fellatio upon him when he grabbed her head and forced it towards his penis. Primarily because of the relatively short period of time that the offence took, I will find that it is slightly below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 23 There are special circumstances in this case. This is the first real period of custody to be served by the offender and as I have mentioned he is significantly depressed and anxious, much more so than is generally the case and he will benefit from an extended period of parole upon his release from custody in order to re-establish himself back in the community.24 I will not impose sentences on the first two counts on the indictment which are accumulated upon any other sentence. They will be wholly concurrent with the sentence for the more serious offence. The offender went into custody on 11 August 2008 and so the sentences I will impose will commence from that day. 25 On counts 1 and 2 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a fixed term of three years to date from 11 August 2008.26 On count 3 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of five years and a head sentence of eight years to date from 11 August 2008 which means that the offender will be eligible to be released to parole on 10 August 2013. I recommend that the offender be considered for acceptance into the CUBIT program.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: On the 17 June 2008, the offender, Paul Raymond Evans, was arraigned upon an indictment containing four counts of indecently assaulting a person who was under sixteen and under his authority, one count of committing a gross act of indecency with a male under the age of eighteen, one count of committing an act of indecency towards a person under sixteen, seven counts of homosexual intercourse by a teacher with a male pupil under the age of eighteen, and three counts of homosexual intercourse with a male under the age of eighteen. He pleaded not guilty to each of those charges whereupon he was tried before a jury. On 25 July 2008 the jury returned verdicts of guilty on eighteen counts and not guilty on two counts. The acquittals were for one of the offences of homosexual intercourse by a teacher and for one of the offences of indecently assaulting a person under sixteen under his authority. The matter was then stood over to 19 September when I heard and received evidence and submissions on sentence, before standing the matter over until today.FACTS2 It is appropriate to commence a recitation of the facts of the case with some background and first I quote a portion of the Crown’s written submissions which is uncontroversial. 
     
      
      ”All of the victims came into contact with the offender when they were at Boys’ Town at Engadine. Boys’ Town was and is a residential and educational facility operated by the Salesians, an order of priests and brothers within the Catholic church. The primary focus of the Salesian order is to work with disadvantaged and marginalised youth. Each of the victims was at Boys’ Town because of behavioural or learning problems often caused by a dysfunctional family background.” 
      
      
    3 The offender was born in 1951. During his formative years at school he came under the influence of the Catholic church in that he was educated by brothers of a religious order. His years in primary school and high school have been described in generally uneventful terms. He was competent academically and he developed a keen interest in outdoor activities through scouting and other groups. He said in his evidence that he had a lot of girlfriends. After completing his Higher School Certificate in 1969 he had taken the decision to enter the priesthood and so he commenced studies at a seminary at Springwood. As part of pastoral work experience he and some other students attended the Dharruk Juvenile Detention Centre near Windsor. This, he said, helped to crystallise his thoughts of combining his future role as a priest with helping less advantaged young people. 4 In the latter part of his third year at the seminary, which was in 1972, he came into contact with Boys' Town at Engadine. He then took the decision to defer the remainder of his studies as a seminarian. He moved back home to live with his family in Cronulla and took employment as a wardsman at Sutherland District Hospital. He worked as a volunteer at Boys' Town on a part time basis. After a year of being back in the community he said he was then faced with the choice between a celibate and a non-celibate life. Having had the opportunity to work with disadvantaged boys at Boys' Town, and the prospect of continuing with that work as well as becoming a priest, he decided upon the former of those choices. He applied to join the Salesian order and he was accepted into its college at Lysterfield in Victoria in January 1974. 5 He remained at that college for the next three years. At the end of 1974, after living what he described as a life of poverty, chastity and obedience, he took his first vows. At the end of 1976 he took his final vows and became permanently devoted to such a life. In his time at Lysterfield he had also completed his teaching degree. In 1977 he was posted to a regional college of the Salesian order at Chadstone where he taught high school students. 6 In the year the offender worked at the college at Chadstone he also worked weekends at a youth centre on Brunswick Road in Melbourne where he assisted with underprivileged children. This year was part of a practical training exercise. At the end of that year he was then appointed to a position at Boys' Town where he commenced in January 1978. The offender described the situation at Boys' Town at that time as involving interaction with, and supervision of, 160 or so boys, twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week. It was still school holiday time when he took up his appointment. Most of the boys were away either living with their families or with volunteer host families. When the school year started the offender was allocated to dormitory duties in which he assisted two other Salesians to generally supervise the boys in what was then the senior dormitory from early in the morning until late at night.7 Boys came to be sent to Boys' Town by being referred by local priests in their community if it was identified that they would benefit from being at Boys' Town, or they would be referred from the Juvenile Justice system and the courts. Others would come because their families simply could not cope for economic reasons, and some were there as orphans. 8 I do not think it is necessary to go into great detail about the infrastructure at Boys' Town except to say that the facilities included dormitories, initially just a senior and junior dormitory, but later a middle dormitory was added, a chapel, schoolrooms, and various recreational areas such as a swimming pool, tennis courts and the like. 9 The boys’ recreational pursuits comprised activities within the Boys' Town campus as well as a variety of off-site activities. Bush walking, camping, canoeing, abseiling, surfing, as well as organised sporting activities, were amongst those available for the boys to engage in. Often there were overnight and weekend trips away. Boys' Town owned a house at Bundeena which was used in the context of these off-campus activities. 10 So much for background. I come now to the offences that occurred in the 1970s for which the offender was found guilty. 11 WC was born in April 1963. His parents separated when he was about seven. He and his older brothers ended up being placed at Boys' Town. He was there from 29 March 1971 until 8 February 1978. He had no contact with either his mother or father in the first two years. He then left and lived with his mother for a few weeks in February 1975 but that did not work out and he was returned to Boys' Town. He tried living with family again for three months in 1976 but he got into trouble with the police and was again returned. He did not realise it at the time but he later learned that he had been made a State ward. 12 WC was asked what his time was like at Boys' Town and he said it was bad. He spoke of a lot nights spent crying and a lot of days being lonely. He said he was scared. He was there a long time and he was only a little boy. Over time it got worse. He was subjected to bullying by other boys and to sexual molestation by priests, first by Father Fleming, the then rector of Boys' Town, now deceased, and then by the offender. 13 The first specific occasion he could recall in relation to the offender is the offence that comprises count 1, an offence of indecent assault upon a male person between 1 December 1977 and 8 February 1978 (an offence against s 81 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for five years). WC said that it was at night and he was returning to the dormitory from an aero-modelling class when he came across the offender near the theatre or TV room. He was told to come inside. WC said he was scared. Once inside the room the offender took each of their pants off, said, “Everything’s all right, it’s natural, you’ve done this before.” This may have been a reference to earlier molestation by Father Fleming. The offender then lay WC down, lay on top of him, and rubbed his erect penis up and down on him until he ejaculated. Semen was over WC’s body, primarily on his leg. The offender then told him not to say anything because no-one would believe him. WC wiped the semen off and said he had to go to bed without having a shower. He said he could still smell the semen. It must have haunted him because he later burnt his leg with molten plastic to try and rid himself of the taint. Some time later when he realised that did not get rid of the memory he tried to get rid of his leg by tying a tourniquet around it. This caused blood clots and subsequent complications. He still bears the scars. 14 Count 2, also an offence of indecent assault upon a male person between 1 December 1977 and 8 February 1978, involved similar behaviour by the offender but on this occasion it occurred in the dormitory. It was during holiday time and most of the other boys were away. He said it was late at night and he was either alone or there were few other boys around. The offender came and woke him from his sleep. He lay on his bed, removed his pyjamas and his own clothes, lay on top of him and rubbed up and down until he ejaculated. 15 WC said that after this happened he just had to get out of Boys' Town. He ran away and sought out his father and lived with him for a short time. He told his father that he had been touched by a priest at Boys' Town and his father laughed at him. In response, WC burnt the house down and thereafter lived on the streets. 16 There was an issue at the trial as to whether these events could have occurred, given that the offender did not come to Boys' Town until mid-January 1978, and there was a record that indicated that WC left on 9 December 1977. WC said that the record was wrong and that he was definitely still at Boys' Town in early 1978. it is unnecessary to refer to the evidence in detail but in short, I am satisfied that it was open to the jury to doubt the accuracy of the record and accept the evidence of WC. WC impressed as a most credible witness. 17 JT was born in May 1965. He was at Boys' Town from September 1976 until December 1979. He was the eldest of three children in a single parent family which he described as being very poor. His father had left the home when he was aged about five. When he was about nine or ten he started to get into trouble in that he was truanting from primary school, and he engaged in shoplifting. His mother spoke to the Department of Youth and Community Services and as a result a decision was taken to place him at Boys' Town. In the three years that he was at Boys' Town he said he saw his family between two and four times a year. He said there was an opportunity for parents to come to visit at Boys' Town on Sundays but that rarely happened for him. He did, however, have an opportunity to go home during holidays. 18 The offender became involved with JT in the context of outdoor recreational activities and in working on hobbies such as model building. He recalled going away from Boys' Town to go fishing, surfing and bush walking. There were overnight camping trips or retreats. JT remembered one particular camping trip that was somewhere near Bundeena. He recalled that this was after he had been at Boys' Town for about two and a half years. There were somewhere between twelve and twenty boys involved in the trip.19 After the evening meal at the campsite the boys were sitting around the campfire with the offender when the offender asked who wanted to sleep in his tent. The offender motioned towards one boy who declined and so JT put up his hand and said he wanted to. He thought it would be a treat. A short time after this the offender suggested that JT go to bed as it was getting late. JT went to the offender’s tent and got into his sleeping bag. The offender came in when he was half asleep. He suggested that JT would be cooler if he opened up his sleeping bag. He did that and went back to sleep. Some time later he awoke to find the offender’s hand on his shorts, fondling his penis. JT was scared and confused and did not know what to do. After a few minutes the offender stopped doing that but took JT’s hand and placed it on his own penis and had JT’s hand rubbing his penis. He recalled the offender’s breathing was heavy. This went on for a few minutes until JT pretended to wake up and told the offender that he had to go to the toilet. He joined a few other boys who were still sitting around the campfire. He was in a state of shock and was scared and confused. He remembered telling one of his friends but he was not sure whether he was believed. He spent the rest of the night sleeping by the campfire. 20 Those two acts are the offences in counts 3 and 4 which are each offences of indecently assaulting a male person between 1 January and 31 December 1979 (s 81 - five years). 21 After the camp was over and the boys had returned to Boys' Town, JT mentioned being touched by the offender to a number of other boys. This came to the attention of Brother Mason who spoke to him about it. He recalled being taken to speak with Father Fleming. On his recollection Father Fleming told him that some things happen, that men get urges, and that it did not mean anything. JT said that he was left feeling very confused. He said that he had grown up without a father, that he felt vulnerable and frightened and did not have any adult person he could talk to. Thereafter the matter was not spoken of again. JT kept recalling Father Fleming’s advice, that it was just one of those things that happened and that he should not worry about it. JT also remembered that he received more favourable attention thereafter from the offender in relation to model car building and that made him feel special.22 Up until this incident occurred on the camping trip, JT said that he had loved being at Boys' Town. He had come from a broken home and he said he had been off the rails, but at Boys' Town he had been provided with many new opportunities. He was doing well at school and getting to go to places that his mother could never have taken him. After the incident, notwithstanding the favourable treatment he was receiving from the offender, he had the impression that everyone else, including the brothers and priests at Boys' Town, knew about what had occurred. He was the subject of teasing from some of the other boys. He begged his mother to allow him to come home and at the end of the year he did leave Boys' Town and went home to live with his mother.23 JT said that initially he did not tell his mother about what had happened because he was too ashamed. At some later stage he did start to try and tell her but said that she did not want to hear about it and could not deal with it and never wanted him to speak about it again. 24 Those are the facts relating to the offences that were committed in the 1970s comprising counts 1 to 4 on the indictment. 25 The offender left Boys' Town in the summer of 1979/1980. For the next four years he undertook theological studies at a college owned by the Salesians at Oakleigh in Melbourne. Whilst engaged there in full-time studies, the offender also involved himself with the local youth centre. 26 In June of 1983 the offender was ordained as a priest in the Salesian order. 27 Having completed his studies at the end of 1983 he was posted to the St John’s Boys’ Home in South Australia for the first half of 1984. The balance of 1984 he spent teaching at a boarding school called Rupertswood in Sunbury near Melbourne. At the end of 1984 he was advised that his next posting was a return to Boys' Town and he arrived back there in the middle of January 1985. There had been some quite significant changes in the time of his absence. The number of boys had been reduced to about forty, whilst the religious staff number had remained at eight. There were now three dormitories rather than two. He was allocated the duty of supervising the middle dormitory. 28 DT was born in February 1971. He was at Boys' Town from the age of fourteen until seventeen, that is from July 1985 until November 1988. He was in the middle dormitory for all of that time. 29 DT was born in New Zealand but was adopted and lived in Sydney until he was sent to Boys' Town. I take it the reason he was sent to Boys' Town was because of some conflict within his family. He said he enjoyed his time at Boys' Town as it provided a relief from his home life. He said there were options for sport and options for making friends. He said however that his time at Boys' Town was tainted by the offender’s behaviour towards him. 30 DT said that, generally speaking, he got on quite well with the offender. He described him as authoritative yet approachable. He looked upon the offender as a father figure. 31 He developed a friendship with the offender and found it easy to communicate with him. DT said that in the dormitory after lights out the offender would come to his bed and talk to him and rub or scratch his back. He found this quite comforting. This became quite a regular occurrence. He said that there were times when he would fall asleep and then wake up later and find that the offender was still there. 32 As part of his role as dormitory master, the offender used to sleep in a curtained off cubicle at one end of the dormitory. At one point at night after lights out, he asked DT to leave his bed and come to his cubicle. DT complied. They lay in the offender’s bed and initially the offender scratched his back which DT said he enjoyed. The offender then asked DT whether he would like to experience a ‘new feeling.’ He did not explain what it was. However he proceeded to remove DT’s pants and masturbated DT to the point of ejaculation. The offender then proceeded to masturbate himself in DT’s presence, also to the point of ejaculation. DT said that it became a regular occurrence for the offender to take him to his cubicle and for the offender to masturbate him. The offender masturbating himself, however, occurred only on the first occasion that he was in his cubicle. DT said that he could not remember how many times this happened except that it happened regularly, right up until not long before he left Boys' Town.33 The first occasion of the offender masturbating DT comprised the offence in count 5 of committing an act of gross indecency with a male under the age of eighteen (s 78Q(1) - 2 years). The accused masturbating himself on that occasion comprised the offence in count 6 of committing an act of indecency towards a person under sixteen (s 61E(2) - 2 years).34 SV was born in April 1972. In his youth he preferred to be known as S because people had difficulty pronouncing his first name. He was at Boys' Town from May 1986 until November 1988. Accordingly, he was there from the age of fourteen until sixteen. His parents separated when he was around the age of seven. His parents moved around quite a lot and he lived either with his mother or in foster homes. He had no contact with his father at all after the separation. He described his relationship with his mother as ‘troubled.’ He was not coping at school, nor at home, and was getting into trouble to the point where a decision was made for him to go to Boys' Town. SV seems to have settled in to Boys' Town rather well in that, whereas in the past, he said he never really had friends, here he was able to mix with other boys and also engage in activities that appealed to him like surfing, diving, fishing. SV said that he related well with the offender, not only in his capacity as dormitory master, but also as the person who took the boys on outdoor activities. He described the offender as being ’really affectionate towards me’ and also as a ‘pretty hands-on sort of person.’ 35 SV said that of a night after lights out in the dormitory the offender used to come to his bed and whisper to him and also touch and rub him. He said this escalated over time and it developed to the stage where there was a lot of fondling and petting going on. He said on occasions he would be either half asleep or asleep and would awake to find the offender doing this. 36 Count 7 is an offence of homosexual intercourse by a teacher with a male pupil under the age of eighteen (s 78N - 14 years). SV said the fondling and petting escalated to the offender ‘putting his head under the covers and putting his mouth on and around my penis.’ SV said that the sexual touching and fondling continued up until about February 1988 but the event that the Crown relied on for count 7 was the first occasion of the offender engaging in oral sex with SV.37 SD was born in February 1972 and was at Boys' Town from July 1985 until November 1988, that is from the age of thirteen until sixteen. He was in the middle dormitory that the offender was in charge of in 1986 and 1987. SD had been sent to Boys' Town by a Children’s Court Magistrate. He described himself as a very hyperactive young person who was getting into trouble doing “silly things”. 38 SD said that he really enjoyed life at Boys' Town, particularly the social life and sporting and outdoor activities. However, after a few weeks or perhaps after a month after starting to live in the middle dormitory SD said that the offender started coming to his bed at night, fondling and groping him. He said he would touch him on the penis and around the groin. The Crown relied upon the first of these occasions as comprising the offence in count 8, an offence of indecent assault upon a person under sixteen by a person in authority (s 61E(1A) - 6 years).39 Count 9 is an offence of homosexual intercourse by a teacher with a male pupil under eighteen (s 78N - 14 years). In relation to this, SD gave evidence that the offender took him to what SD referred to as the ‘priests’ quarters’, meaning the private living area available to the priests that were adjacent to the middle dormitory, and made him take the offender’s penis into his mouth. He said the offender ‘made me put my mouth around his penis and go down on it.’ He said that he did not want to do it but the offender gave him alcohol on this occasion and ‘manipulated me into doing it.’ By reference to other evidence this event occurred in about June or July 1986. 40 Count 10 is also an offence of homosexual intercourse by a teacher with a male pupil under eighteen (s 78N -14 years). SD gave evidence of an incident of oral sex in the showers. He said there was an occasion when there was some sport or after school activities and the offender did not allow him to go. He said the two went in to the shower area where the offender fondled him and then put SD’s penis into his mouth. This occurred some time between June 1986 and June 1987. 41 Count 11 is another offence of homosexual intercourse by a teacher with a male pupil under eighteen (s 78N -14 years). In relation to this, SD gave evidence of an occasion when there was an afternoon excursion to a place that he thought was Garie Beach. He said the offender, himself and some other boys were there. Whilst the other boys were swimming or otherwise engaged in beach activities, the offender took him to the Kombi van they had travelled in. The offender first told him to sit in the front seat so that they could be sure that no nearby residents were watching, and then told him to get into the back of the van. Once there the offender began to fondle him, pulled his pants down, and then took SD’s penis into his mouth. He said he ‘started sucking it, going down on it.’ SD added that the offender knew that he was not keen on this so the offender ‘did it quickly and then shooed him off.’ This event occurred some time between June 1986 and the end of 1987. 42 Count 12 is an offence for which the jury returned the verdict of not guilty. The acquittal is explicable for the reasons discussed in the proceedings on sentence. 43 AK was born in May 1972. He was at Boys' Town when he was aged fourteen and fifteen from September 1986 until December 1987. He was the middle of three brothers. He said he was diagnosed with ADHD at some time when he was in primary school. He said his behaviour at school was disruptive and being sent to Boys' Town was a last resort. Initially he was in the middle dormitory where the offender was the dormitory master and he spent the latter part of his time at Boys' Town in Dunlea which was the senior dormitory.44 AK said that initially he had difficulty sleeping and the offender used to come to his bed and comfort him which included massaging him. He said this progressed to the point where the offender started to fondle his genital area. He said this and other sexual activity occurred on subsequent occasions but in relation to count 13, an offence of indecent assault upon a person under sixteen by a person in authority (s 61E(1A) - 6 years), the Crown relied upon the first occasion of the offender fondling AK’s genitals in AK’s bed. 45 AK left Boys' Town after attaining his school certificate at the end of 1987. He and the offender kept in contact. In early 1988 the offender was charged in relation to an allegation of molesting a boy at Boys' Town. That matter went to court and the charge or charges were subsequently dismissed. However at some stage whilst that charge, or those charges, were pending, the offender made contact with AK and told him that he had been accused of molesting a boy and suggested to AK that if anyone was to ask AK about the offender he should speak favourably of him. In this context the offender asked AK if there was anything he could do for him and AK said something about wanting to go flying. The offender agreed to arrange this as by this stage the offender had obtained a light aircraft pilot’s licence. AK’s perception was that this was some sort of bribe for him to keep his mouth shut. AK gave evidence of the offender coming to AK’s home one night and having dinner with the family, in the course of which permission was given for the offender to take AK and his younger brother flying. The arrangement was for the offender to take the two boys flying and also to take them on the same weekend to the Boys' Town house at Bundeena to spend the night. The offender was living at that house because he had been suspended from duties at Boys' Town. This evidence of AK’s was supported generally by his mother and his younger brother. 46 AK said that when they were at the Bundeena house that weekend he slept in one bedroom and the offender had his younger brother sleep in another room. AK said that during the night the offender came to him and ‘he touched me, he got me aroused, then he performed oral sex and made me perform oral sex and then he performed anal sex.’ These three forms of intercourse comprise the offences of homosexual intercourse with a male under eighteen which are counts 14, 15 and 16 (s 78K - 10 years).47 DP was born in March 1973 and was at Boys' Town from February 1986 until August 1988, that is, from when he was aged twelve to fifteen. He said he was the fifth youngest of six siblings. His father was away from home a lot in the course of his work. His mother was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis when he was very young. He described his home life as difficult for these reasons. His elder siblings had left home by which time DP was left to do a lot of the domestic chores around the house. He found school difficult and by the time he got into Year 7 he was truanting. He said the reason for this was that he had been sexually molested by the school principal. It apparently reached the point where he was going to be expelled from school and the decision was taken to send him to Boys' Town. 48 DP was first placed in the junior dormitory but he was in the offender’s dormitory in 1987 and for at least the first term of 1988. Like a number of the other complainants, DP found considerable enjoyment at Boys' Town in that he too enjoyed the sporting and outdoor activities. He spoke of the offender taking himself and other boys away on camping and fishing trips. DP said that the offender had favourites among the boys and they included not only himself but also XV and SD. These boys received preferential treatment in terms of outdoor activities and weekend trips away. In fact, there was a considerable body of evidence in the Crown case of the offender providing such preferential treatment to certain boys but it is unnecessary to go into the detail of it now. 49 Count 17 was an offence which was alleged to have been committed on one of those trips. However, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty in respect of that matter and, as in the case of count 12, that acquittal is explicable for the reasons that were discussed at the proceedings on sentence. 50 Count 18 is an offence of homosexual intercourse by a teacher with a male pupil under eighteen (s 78N - 14 years). In relation to this the evidence was that the offender came to DP’s bed in the dormitory where there was some touching and fondling and then the offender led DP to his own curtained off sleeping area where he again touched DP’s penis and fondled it until it was erect and then put his mouth on it. 51 Count 19 is an offence of indecent assault upon a person under sixteen under authority (s 61E(1A) - 6 years). This relates to an incident in which the offender took DP to his curtained off sleeping area, undressed him and told him to lie on the bed. The offender then went and got some butter and returned and rubbed it on DP’s groin. The offender then lay on top of DP and pressed his erect penis against him and ‘did the motion like I was a woman and did his business’ until he ejaculated. DP gave evidence of this happening on more than one occasion but the Crown relied upon the first occasion of that happening to comprise count 19.52 Count 20 is also an offence of homosexual intercourse by a teacher with a male pupil under eighteen (s 78N - 14 years). In relation to this matter the evidence was that the offender took DP into his cubicle where he asked DP to suck his penis. DP told him he did not want to but the offender kept saying, ‘it is all right.’ DP eventually agreed to do so if the offender put a condom on. He said that the offender did so and DP then complied but he said that it made him feel disgusted and sick and so he only did it for about ten seconds before stopping.UNCHARGED ACTS 53 There was evidence in the trial of other sexual activity that the offender engaged in with the complainants who were DT, SV, SD, AK and DP. There was no such evidence in relation to the complainants WC and JT. There was evidence of sexual misconduct by the offender with MO, whose name also should not be published, but those incidents occurred in Victoria and so, of course, could not be the subject of proceedings in this jurisdiction. At the trial the Crown relied upon this evidence of uncharged sexual acts as establishing a tendency by the offender to sexually assault pubescent boys. As those acts are not the subject of charges for which the offender has been found guilty he is not to be punished for them. The relevance of those other acts at this stage is simply to deny to the offender any leniency that might have been extended to him if the charged offences for which he was found guilty by the jury were isolated incidents. However, because there are eighteen offences, none of them could really be regarded as isolated aberrations in the offender’s conduct.OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCES54 There are a number of features to be considered in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences. One is the nature of the activity that comprised the assaults. Where the offences involved penetration, some forms of penetration can be regarded as more serious than others: see Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447.55 Mr McGrath, counsel for the offender, has submitted that I should regard the act of anal intercourse with AK as being more serious than the incidents where the offender penetrated the mouths of a complainant which, in turn, should be regarded as more serious than the incidents where the offender committed acts of oral sex upon a complainant. I am prepared to accept that the act of anal intercourse is the more serious but when I have regard to all matters relevant to the assessment of the seriousness of the oral sex offences, I do not think consideration of whose penis was in whose mouth is of any great significance. The Crown accepts that fellatio is less seriously criminal than anal intercourse.56 An important matter to recognise in making this assessment of the seriousness of the offences in relation to the complainants WC and JT is that the law in relation to sexual assaults was dramatically overhauled and updated in 1981 and again in 1984. Prior to that, sexual intercourse was restricted in meaning to penile/vaginal intercourse and homosexual intercourse, then referred to as buggery, was restricted to meaning penile/anal intercourse. That meant that all other forms of sexual assault were classified as indecent assaults or acts of indecency. For example, an act of digital penetration or oral sex would have been prosecuted as an indecent assault whereas after the reforms of the early 1980s it could be prosecuted as sexual intercourse or homosexual intercourse. As a consequence, something that might be held now to be, say, in the middle of the range of seriousness would in the 1970s have been regarded as being lower down the range.57 Another matter to take into to take into account is that each of the offender’s crimes were committed in a gross breach of the trust that reposed in him as a teacher, either priest or brother, and dormitory supervisor or master. He was in a position of power and authority. He was entrusted with the care of boys, generally speaking, who were at Boys’ Town because of a variety of personal difficulties they had experienced in their short lives. These boys were particularly vulnerable. With the exception of JT, in respect of whom the offences were committed on an opportunistic single occasion, and WC, in respect of whom there were no uncharged acts, the offender cultivated the complainant’s compliance with his unbridled sexual urges.58 The offences in counts 14 to 16 occurred after AK had left Boys’ Town. However, the breach of trust element was still there in that the offender was playing on the trust that he had developed in his relationship with AK at Boys’ Town and, moreover, he had obtained the permission of AK’s mother to take away and, implicitly, care for AK and his younger brother for that weekend.59 I am satisfied that the offender knew that he was protected from discovery because of his manipulation of the boys’ wills and because they did not have the psychological wherewithal to complain. I am also satisfied that he realised that even if a boy was to complain to another of the priests or brothers at Boys’ Town there was a fair chance that nothing would come of it. As was said more than once during the trial, who would believe that a priest would do such things to a boy in his care? Moreover, the offender would not have forgotten that nothing happened when questions were raised as to what had gone on at the camp near Bundeena when JT was assaulted. He knew what he had done on that occasion and must have thought he had got away with it, thereby adding to his confidence that his offending behaviour was almost immune from discovery. 60 In relation to this issue of breach of trust, I am conscious that this is inherent in the offences of a teacher having homosexual intercourse with a pupil and indecent assault upon a person under sixteen who was under his authority. However, the relationship between the offender and the complainant in respect of those charges went beyond one of mere teacher/pupil or having authority over the complainants. As it is something that is present to a degree that exceeds the threshold to make out that relationship it remains a matter of aggravation. Nevertheless, in respect of those offences, the breach of trust aspect must be discounted in its significance to an appropriate degree in order not to double count.61 The Crown’s analysis of this aspect is most apt so I will quote that portion of the Crown’s submissions: 
     
      
      “Overall, the prisoner was in a unique position of authority in relation to the victims. He was responsible for their physical, emotional, educational and spiritual welfare. At the time of the earlier offences (1978 and 1979) he was not the primary authority figure in the boys’ lives at Boys’ Town but he did share responsibility for their wellbeing with other Salesians. Those offences could be regarded as more opportunistic than the latter ones, in that he took advantage of his temporary proximity to the particular boy (WC and JT) to seek sexual gratification.  
       
       
      The latter offences (1985 – 1988) involved a more sinister and calculated breach of trust. They occurred in an environment where the prisoner had virtually total responsibility for the boys - the middle dormitory. He cultivated the boys’ affection by engaging with them in outdoor activities and by rewarding selected boys with special treats or privileges, such as weekend camping trips. Within the dormitory he exploited their genuine affection towards him by molesting them in their beds and later in his own bed. For some of the victims he was the only adult male presence” - I would add, of significance - “in their lives. He exploited their emotional vulnerability for his personal sexual gratification. He was highly regarded by the parents of some of the boys who, in good faith, entrusted their sons to his care, especially outside normal school hours. He breached the trust of the boys, their parents, and the community” - and I would add, and of his church - “in a most egregious way.” 
      
      
    62 Another matter of significance is the psychological and emotional trauma occasioned to each of the complainants. I am satisfied that the memory of what the offender did has haunted each of the complainants ever since and it has had a negative effect on their lives in a variety of ways. The extent of this trauma has quite obviously been substantial but beyond saying that, it is difficult to assess it with any precision because, as was submitted, the complainants already had experienced emotional and social disadvantage before coming to Boys’ Town. Two of them had already been sexually abused by another adult. However, the offender played a significant role in the pastoral care of each of the boys. He was well aware of the difficulties they had experienced in their lives before they came to Boys’ Town. If I am to be cautious about attributing their subsequent life difficulties to the offender’s criminal activity, then I should also take into account that he offended against boys whom he knew were more vulnerable than most.63 Mr McGrath has submitted that I should be “wary about making a finding under s 21A(2)(g) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act that the emotional harm caused was in any case substantial for the purpose of aggravating the offence because the court would presume that offences of this description occasion emotional and psychological harm to the victim”. I think that is right because these are offences specifically directed at sexual abuse of children and the heavy penalties that are provided are, in part, in recognition of the substantial harm that such activity occasions to the victims. In saying this I should not be taken to be saying that I do not accept that substantial harm was caused. Clearly it was. I have the evidence of each of the complainants in the trial as well as the Victim Impact Statement of DT that establishes this. What I am saying here is that it would be double counting for me to have regard to the maximum penalties for the offences which has inbuilt recognition of the harm such offences cause and then to also find that the severity of the offences is aggravated because substantial harm was caused. 64 Mr McGrath has submitted that in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences I should take into account that “for the large part the offences were low on the scale of actual violence with no evidence of physical injury”. I accept that submission. None of the offences involved any allegation of physical violence beyond the sexual act itself.65 Having regard to all of the circumstances, including the ages of the complainants relative to the age element that is specified in most of the offences, but particularly the various matters I have just been discussing I assess the objective seriousness of the offences as follows. The offences concerning WC, DT, XV, counts 9, 10 and 11 in relation to SD, counts 14 and 15 in relation to AK, and counts 18 and 20 concerning DP are in the middle of the range for offences of their respective types. The offences concerning JT, count 8 relating to SD and count 13 in relation to AK are below the middle of the range. The offence in count 16 concerning AK, and that in count 19 concerning DP, are above the middle of the range. They are not in the worst case category but they are, nevertheless, very serious examples of those types of offences.DELAY IN PROSECUTION66 The complainants gave various reasons why they either did not complain about the offender’s conduct at the time, or, if they did, why they did not persist with the complaint. I will not go into the reasons they gave - that evidence is available in the trial transcript - but suffice to say that the reasons they each gave were credible. The question of whether there was any collaboration between any of the complainants before they had made their complaints to the authorities was thoroughly explored at the trial and it was quite clear that there had not been.67 The fact of the matter remains, however, that there has been an extensive period of time that has elapsed between the commission of the offences and now. This is relevant to my sentencing task in two ways. The Court of Criminal Appeal held in R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368 that in a situation such as this case presents the sentencing court is to take into account the sentencing practice as at the date of the commission of an offence. Identification of that sentencing practice is not without difficulty. It has been the subject of discussion in a number of recent cases including Bradbury v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 93, and AJB v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 51.68 The regime of sentencing in the 1970s and 1980s was governed by the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966, and then the Probation and Parole Act 1983. Remissions of either one-third or one-quarter were applied to the head sentence under the former Act and to the non-parole period as well under the latter. This regime was in place until the Sentencing Act 1989 was proclaimed to commence in September 1989 and so it applied throughout the period of the offences in the present case. No allowance was made for the remission system when sentences were imposed. It has recently been held that when a court now sentences for offences committed when the earlier regime applied no regard should be had for the fact that sentences in those days were reduced by operation of the remission system: see Bradbury v Regina and AJB v Regina.69 For most of the time under the earlier regime, there was no statutory regulation of the proportion of the head sentence that was made up by the non-parole period. It was not until 1 January 1988 that provision was made by the Probation and Parole (Serious Offences) Amended Act 1987 for non-parole periods to be three-quarters of the total sentence for certain “serious offences” unless the circumstances justified a shorter period and 25 September 1989, that such a requirement applied to all offences unless there were special circumstances. Some of the offences that I am concerned with in this case were committed in the period in which the 1987 Amendment Act applied. However, none of the offences meet the classification of “serious offences” that the Amendment Act provided.70 In AJB it was noted that in 1982, non-parole periods were in the order of one-third to one-half of the total term of the sentence. In Bradbury, no material was placed before the court as to the pattern of non-parole periods in the 1970s but Matthews AJ, with whom the President and Latham J agreed, felt it was reasonable to assume that it was in the same order as that which applied in 1982, that is, somewhere between one-third and one-half of the total sentence. I have reviewed a large number of New South Wales sentencing cases for a period from the early 1970s to mid 1985 that are collected in Ross W Carter, “Australian Sentencing Digest”, 1985. The Law Book Company Limited, and in the 1985 supplement to that work, and it confirms the reasonableness of that assumption for that period. That is not to say that there were not exceptions. Some cases involved non-parole periods greater than one-half and, indeed, in some cases there was no non-parole period set at all. What I make of this is that I should have regard to the usual one-third to one-half proportion that applied under that earlier sentencing regime but I should not feel constrained to impose non-parole periods in the present case of that proportion if there is good reason to do otherwise. 71 Having regard to the regime of sentencing that prevailed at the time of the offences has been accepted as a special circumstance under the present legislation justifying a departure from the now mandated usual expectation that non-parole periods will be three-quarters of the total sentence. Other matters that Mr McGrath has submitted that I should consider in this context of special circumstances are the age of the offender and that this will be his first experience of imprisonment. I do not believe that those matters warrant an expansion of the parole period at the expense of the non-parole period because the parole period that will be allowed is more than adequate for assistance to be provided to the offender by the Probation and Parole Service to re-establish his life in the community following release. The accumulation of sentences, which it has been conceded I must order at least partially, is another matter that I will take into account. I must also, however, take into account what the majority in the High Court said in Power v The Queen (1973) 131 CLR 623 at 627 that the non-parole period should represent “the minimum period of imprisonment to be served because the sentencing judge considers that the crime committed calls for such detention”. In the same case, at 628, it was held that general deterrence is amongst the objectives in relation to setting the non-parole period. I record here that I have set the non-parole component of the total effective sentence with what was said in Power v The Queen firmly in mind. It is for that reason that the non-parole period I am to impose will be greater than the one-third to one-half proportion that usually obtained.72 Another matter relevant to the principle that I must sentence in accordance with the sentencing regime that applied at the time of the offences is to determine whether any particular range of sentencing is identifiable. That poses a difficulty. There is, to my knowledge, no statistical material available to indicate what range of penalties were imposed for these kinds of offences in the 1970s and 1980s. Absent that, and there being no other available means of identifying any sentencing range, for the correct approach I draw from the following in the judgment of Howie J in R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 at 511 [70] – [71], case citations omitted, which was referred to and applied by Sully J in MJR: 
     
      
      “70. The nature of the criminal conduct proscribed by an offence and the maximum penalty applicable to the offence are crucially important factors in the synthesis which leads to the determination of the sentence to be imposed upon a particular offender for the particular crime committed. Even after taking into account the subjective features of the offender and all the other matters relevant to sentencing, such as individual and general deterrence, the sentence imposed should reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, and be proportional to the criminality involved in the offence committed. Whether the sentence to be imposed meets these criteria will be determined principally by a consideration of the nature of the criminal conduct as viewed against the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence.  
       
       
      71. When sentencing an offender for offences committed many years earlier and where no sentencing range current at the time of offending can be established, the court will by approaching the sentencing task in this way effectively sentence the offender in accordance with the policy of the legislature current at the time of the offending and consistently with the approach adopted by sentencing courts at that time.” 
      
    73 The other way in which the delay is relevant is that in the intervening period there is no suggestion that the offender has committed any further offences. The fact that he offended on a persistent basis with a number of boys in the 1970s and 1980s and then has not continued to do so in the ensuing twenty years or so can be taken as an indication that he has gained some control over his impulses. Of course, the opportunity for him to commit offences of this nature in this type of cloistered environment was taken away from him when he was stood down from Boys’ Town and required to live elsewhere in February 1988. On the question of his likelihood or unlikelihood of re-offending, it is pertinent to bear in mind the lack of any further offences, as well as the fact that his access to children will be subject to restrictions when he is released from custody. So, should I find in his favour the statutory mitigating features in s 21A(3)(g) and (h) that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend? One matter of concern in this respect is that he has not acknowledged his offences - he continues to deny them - and therefore cannot be said to have any insight into his offending behaviour. Another matter of concern is that there is no psychological or psychiatric material before me that would indicate what drove the offender to offend as he did. Often in cases such as this an offender claims to have been depressed at the time, to having had a problem with alcohol abuse, that there was an isolated aberrant yielding to temptation, or there is some other explanation. Here there is nothing. The only report I have is the Pre Sentence Report and the Probation and Parole Officer there indicates nothing by way of possible explanation. All I can conclude is that the offender was driven by impulses that he would not, or could not, control to derive some base sexual gratification from vulnerable boys who were readily available to him and in respect of whom he was in a position of power and authority. Having regard to all of these matters, I am prepared to find the offender has reasonable, but not good, prospects of rehabilitation. Is he likely to re-offend? I am afraid I just do not know.GOOD CHARACTER 74 Aside from his commission of the offences for which of he has been found guilty the offender was otherwise a person of good character. A large number of testimonials before me speak of a variety of very positive personal attributes he has and of the many and varied forms of assistance he has provided to people in the community. I will take this into account but it is something that has less significance in a case such as this than it might in other types of cases.PROTECTIVE CUSTODY75 A submission was made that I should take into account that the offender will serve his sentence in protective custody. I am prepared to accept that it is quite likely that he will do so because of the nature of his crimes. However, there was no evidence placed before me as to what this will entail if it should occur. It is well known now that arrangements are made for the housing of prisoners serving sentences for such offences. In the ordinary course they are not subject to any particular or unusual deprivations in terms of the time they spend each day in their cells or in their access to facilities and programs. I am mindful of what the Court of Criminal Appeal has said in recent years on this subject: see, for example, R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [176] – [177]. Accordingly I do not propose to make any allowance for this topic in the assessment of the appropriate sentences to impose.DETERRENCE76 In the passage I have quoted earlier from Moon it is clear that general and personal deterrence is a matter to be considered. In the present case, personal deterrence is a consideration, but not to a major extent, because the offender is unlikely to be in a position ever again like he was in at the time of the offences. His access to children will be limited. Nevertheless it is not completely irrelevant, particularly in view of my finding that I cannot determine whether he is unlikely to re-offend. General deterrence also has some significance in sentencing for offences of this type. Mr McGrath has conceded in his written submissions - correctly, if I may respectfully say so - that “any sentences imposed must embrace a substantial element of general deterrence”. It cannot lead to a sentence that is out of proportion to the objective gravity of the offences but it must be given weight. So too must I give weight to denouncing the offender’s conduct and making him accountable for what he did, and the harm he caused, to each of his victims.COMPARATIVE CASES77 There were quite a number of other cases to which I was referred by Mr McGrath and the Crown Prosecutor which involved sentencing of paedophile offenders for multiple offences. No two cases are exactly alike of course. I have derived some guidance as to the approach I should take in this case from a review of those cases. Some of them are more useful than others. They each involve quite different factual circumstances as well as personal circumstances of the offenders, so the assistance is limited for those reasons.STRUCTURING THE SENTENCES78 In structuring the overall sentence I must, in accordance with what the High Court has said in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and Johnson v The Queen (2004) 205 ALR 346, determine sentences that are appropriate for the individual offences and then consider questions of accumulation or concurrence in the light of the principle of totality. There is a measure of flexibility with which I can do this. In a case such as this where there are multiple complainants against whom multiple offences were committed it is appropriate to adopt a practical approach rather than one of rigid technicality. Mr McGrath has submitted on this topic as follows: 
     
      
      “The most obvious method of “grouping” the offences is by reference to offences committed against each victim. Concurrency, or part concurrency, could be ordered in respect of offences committed against a particular victim; that group of offences could then be partially accumulated on the group of offences in respect of the next victim. The principal of totality could be achieved by setting lower individual sentences or directing greater concurrence of sentences; a finding of special circumstances could achieve the appropriate proportion between effective non-parole period and head sentence relative to the sentencing pattern at the time of offending.” 
      
    79 I am going to partially adopt that submission. The most practical approach, it seems to me, is to order the sentences in relation to each victim be served concurrently and then to order partial accumulation upon sentences for offences in relation to other victims. Ordering a greater level of accumulation, which at least theoretically is justifiable, would result in a total sentence that would be beyond that which is appropriate to meet the totality of criminality. I will impose fixed term sentences where there is no utility in setting a non-parole period. In relation to count 19 the non-parole period I am going to set has been determined without regard to the length of the head sentence for that count but solely as to coincide with the date upon which the offender will become eligible for release on parole.80 The offender has been in custody since the date of the jury’s verdict – 25 July 2008 - and so the first of the sentences should be backdated until then.SENTENCES81 For each of the offences for which the jury returned verdicts of guilty you are convicted. 82 In respect of counts 1 and 2 of indecently assaulting a male you are sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years commencing from 25 July 2008 and expiring on 24 July 2010. 83 For the offences in counts 3 and 4 of indecently assaulting a male you are sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of eighteen months commencing on 25 January 2010 and expiring on 24 July 2011. 84 For the offence in count 5 of committing an act of gross indecency with a male under eighteen and the offence in count 6 of committing an act of indecency towards a male under sixteen you are sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of nine months commencing 25 July 2011 and expiring on 24 April 2012. 85 For the offence in count 7 of homosexual intercourse by a teacher with a pupil under eighteen you are sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of five years and six months commencing on 25 January 2012 and expiring on 24 July 2017.86 For the offence in count 8 of indecently assaulting a person under sixteen by a person in authority you are sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of two years commencing on 25 July 2013 and expiring on 24 July 2015.87 For the offences in counts 9, 10 and 11 of homosexual intercourse by a teacher with a pupil under eighteen you are sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of five years and six months commencing on 25 July 2013 and expiring on 24 January 2019. There will be a non-parole period of four years and six months expiring on 24 January 2018. 88 For the offence in count 13 of indecently assaulting a person under sixteen by a person in authority you are sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of eighteen months commencing on 25 July 2016 and expiring on 24 January 2018. 89 For the offence in counts 14 and 15 of homosexual intercourse with a male under eighteen you are sentenced to imprisonment for four years commencing on 25 July 2016 and expiring on 24 July 2020. There will be a non-parole period of eighteen months expiring on 24 January 2018.90 For the offence in count 16 of homosexual intercourse with a male under eighteen you are sentenced to imprisonment for seven years commencing on 25 July 2016 and expiring on 24 July 2023. There will be a non-parole period of eighteen months expiring on 24 January 2018.91 For the offence in count 19 of indecently assaulting a person under sixteen by a person in authority you are sentenced to imprisonment for a fixed term of three years and six months commencing on 25 January 2015 and expiring on 24 July 2018. There will be a non-parole period of three years expiring on 24 January 2018. 92 For the offences in counts 18 and 20 of homosexual intercourse by a teacher with a pupil under eighteen you are sentenced to imprisonment for five years and six months commencing on 25 January 2015 and expiring on 24 July 2020. There will be a non-parole period of three years expiring on 24 January 2018.93 You will be eligible for release on parole on the expiration of non-parole periods on 24 January 2018. 94 The total effective sentence I have imposed upon you is one of fifteen years with a non-parole component of nine and a half years.95 I will just amend what I said earlier about the reasons for setting the non-parole period in relation to count 19 to indicate that that reason also applies in relation to the non-parole periods of counts 9, 10 and 11.

                WEDNESDAY 8 OCTOBER 2008 
                
               
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
     Regina v DK 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: This is an application for leave to appeal from a refusal by Toner DCJ to sever count three from an indictment under which the applicant is charged on three counts. The first two counts charge the applicant with the offences of obtaining a financial advantage by deception, contrary to s 134.2.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995. The third count charges the applicant with dealing with the proceeds of crime where the amount exceeds $100,000, contrary to s 400.4.1 of the Criminal Code Act 1995.  
     
      
    2 The complaint of the applicant goes essentially to two matters. Firstly, whether the different counts can appropriately be included in the one indictment, on the basis that according to the applicant they cannot be said to arise out of the same set of circumstances. Secondly, it is said that evidence admissible in relation to count three might be improperly used by the jury in relation to counts one and two. There is a further complaint that the combination of these counts might unfairly deprive the applicant of lines of defence that he might otherwise follow.  
     
      
    3 In my opinion, on all of these matters there is no reasonable possibility shown of error in the decision of the primary judge. In the circumstances of the case as set out inter alia in the outline of submissions for the Crown, I see no reason for disagreeing with the primary judge’s view that the alleged offences do arise out of the same set of circumstances. I think there is good reason for considering that evidence relevant to each of the three counts will be relevant and admissible in relation to other counts. If there is any particular evidence in relation to some of the counts that is not admissible in relation to other counts, then I do not think there is any reason to think that that cannot be dealt with by appropriate directions.  
     
      
    4 In the circumstances where the claim in relation to unfair deprivation of lines of defence is not supported by any evidence, I see no reason to disagree with the primary judge’s view on that matter either.  
     
      
    5 For those reasons, in my opinion this is not a case in which leave to appeal should be granted, and I would refuse the application for leave to appeal.  
     
      
    6 KIRBY J: I agree.  
     
      
    7 HISLOP J: I also agree.  
     
      
    8 HODGSON JA: That will be the order of the court: the application for leave to appeal is refused.

      The appellant was convicted by a jury of one count of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 (maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment). The appellant was sentenced to a total of 3 years imprisonment, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years. 
       
       
      The appellant alleged there had been a miscarriage of justice, based on the failure of his solicitor to object to irrelevant and prejudicial evidence, tendency or coincidence evidence, and evidence of bad character, or seek directions from the trial judge in respect of this evidence. Further, the appellant alleged that the trial judge had failed to apply the mandatory provisions of the Evidence Act, s 137. He also alleged that his conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory. 
       
       
      In allowing the appeal:  
       
       
      Held per Beazley JA (Hislop and Price JJ agreeing) 
       
       
      1. 
        
      The incompetence of counsel at trial, of itself, will not attract appellate intervention. The question is whether there has been a miscarriage of justice: [39]-[58]. 
       
       
        
        R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677; TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; (2002) 212 CLR 124; Ali v R [2005] HCA 8; (2005) 214 ALR 1; Nudd v R [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614; 162 A Crim R 301 (all applied); Seymour v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 206; 162 A Crim R 576; Mouroufas v R [2007] NSWCCA 58; Rolfe v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 155; (2007) 173 A Crim R 168 (all referred to). 
        
       
       
      2. The failure of counsel to object to irrelevant and prejudicial evidence, leaving the jury with evidence before them that the appellant was violent, sexually predatory and a child molester, amounted to a miscarriage of justice: [60]-[62], [64]-[69], [81]-[83]. 
       
       
        
        TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; (2002) 212 CLR 124; Ali v R [2005] HCA 8; (2005) 214 ALR 1; Nudd v R [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 (all applied). 
        
       
       
      3. The provisions of the Evidence Act, s 137 are mandatory. The trial judge had an obligation not to admit the evidence in respect of which there was a danger of unfair prejudice to the to the appellant, which outweighed its probative value: [60]-[62], [66]-[69], [82]. 
       
       
      R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 186; (2002) 130 A Crim R 44 (applied). 
       
       
      4. The trial judge’s wrongful admission of irrelevant and prejudicial evidence, and the failure to give appropriate directions to the jury, constituted a miscarriage of justice: [60]-[62], [66]-[69], [82], [83]. 
       
       
        
        TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; (2002) 212 CLR 124; Ali v R [2005] HCA 8; (2005) 214 ALR 1; Nudd v R [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 (all applied). 
        
       
       
      5. Due to the admission of prejudicial evidence, the accused lost a reasonable chance of acquittal. The verdict was thus unsafe and unsatisfactory: [86], [87]. 
       
       
      6. The conviction was quashed and a new trial ordered: [87].

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: The appellant was convicted by a jury of one count of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for that offence is 14 years imprisonment. The appellant was sentenced to a total of 3 years imprisonment, comprising a non-parole period of 2 years, commencing 5 February 2007, the date the jury returned its verdict of guilty, and expiring on 4 February 2009. 
     
      
    2 The appellant appeals against his conviction on the basis that the trial miscarried and that the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory. These grounds were complementary and raised the following essential issues:  
     
      
       
      (A) 
       Whether the trial miscarried, due to: 
       
       
        
        1. the incompetence of the appellant’s legal representative at trial, in regards to his failure (i) to object to evidence that was irrelevant to the charge and prejudicial to the accused; (ii) to pursue an objection to the evidence of Senior Constable Harper; and (iii) to seek directions from the trial judge in respect of parts of this evidence, or alternatively, a discharge of the jury; 
        
       
       
        
        2. the failure of the trial judge to direct the jury to ignore evidence that was irrelevant to the charge and prejudicial to the accused; 
        
       
       
        
        3. the failure of the trial judge to give the jury an appropriate direction as to the use to which it could put evidence that, shortly after the incident, the appellant said he was going to Western Australia; 
        
       
       
        
        4. the wrongful admission by the trial judge of the evidence of Senior Constable Harper;  
        
       
       
        
        5. the failure of the trial judge to give proper directions to the jury in respect of parts of the transcript of the ERISP that should not have been given to them; and 
        
       
       
      (B) 
       whether the conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory, because irrelevant and prejudicial material had been admitted into evidence in circumstances where this was not a strong Crown case. 
       
       
      Brief summary of the facts 
       
      
    3 The complainant alleged she was sexually assaulted by the appellant in an apartment to which she had gone with the appellant and the appellant’s friend, Steve Pettiona. The apartment was Mr Pettiona’s residence. The three persons had a drink together in the lounge room. The complainant’s evidence was that at one stage, she excused herself to go to the bathroom, but as she went to do so, the appellant forced her into a small bedroom, pushed her onto the bed and sexually assaulted her.  
     
      
    4 The complainant said she was able to remove herself from the incident by telling the appellant that she needed to go to the toilet. She said she left the bedroom and immediately left the apartment. She said the appellant chased her and grabbed her. She then saw a car coming along the street, which was being driven by the appellant’s wife, and in which the complainant’s daughter was a passenger. They stopped and the complainant’s daughter encouraged her to get into the car with them. The complainant said that in response to a suggestion by the appellant’s wife that the appellant had “put the hard word on her”, she complained that the appellant had “done more than that”, but did not otherwise specify the details of what had happened.  
     
      
    5 The appellant’s wife then drove the complainant and her daughter to the home of another friend, Darlene Robertson. Contact was made with the complainant’s brother, who came to Ms Robertson’s and telephoned the police.  
     
      
    6 The appellant and his wife were friends of the complainant, as was Ms Robertson. The complainant had not previously met Mr Pettiona.  
     
      
    7 The appellant complains that irrelevant and prejudicial evidence was admitted at the trial due to the incompetence of his solicitor in failing to object to the admission of the evidence. He further complains that the trial judge then failed to give directions to the jury to ignore that evidence. He contends that he was thereby denied a fair trial. It followed, on his submission that there was a miscarriage of justice and the verdict was unsafe and unsatisfactory: see Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s 6.  
     
      
       
      Irrelevant and prejudicial evidence 
       
      
    8 The appellant identified the following evidence (being the emphasised portions of the material below) as being irrelevant and prejudicial.  
     
      
       
      (a)(i) 
       
      
    9 The complainant said that after she had left Mr Pettiona’s unit, she had run about half a block, when the appellant had caught up with her and started walking her back towards the unit. At this point, the complainant saw a car which she noticed was being driven by the appellant’s wife, Gail, in which the complainant’s daughter was a passenger. The complainant said that her daughter got out of the car and said, “Mum are you alright?”, to which the complainant said, “No I’m not”. Counsel for the Crown asked the complainant whether Gail said anything to her. The complainant replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “Gail looked over the back to, to me, and goes,  
        ‘He’s put the hard word on you, hasn’t he? 
        ’ And I said, ‘He’s done more than that Gail’. And she – I started crying and she started crying. And she said,  
        ‘It’s okay, he’s done it before’ 
        .”  
        
       
       
      In cross-examination, the complainant said that the appellant’s wife had stated, “ 
      Oh, he’s done it before … he said he’ll never do it again 
      ”.  
       
      
    10 (It should be noted that the Crown, in the opening address to the jury, referred to the appellant’s wife’s proposed evidence that the appellant had “put the hard word on” the complainant.) 
     
      
    11 The appellant’s solicitor did not object to this evidence.  
     
      
    12 The appellant complains that this evidence was tendency or propensity evidence. No tendency notice was served on the accused as required by s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995. It was also submitted that this evidence raised bad character and that the appellant’s solicitor should have sought that the trial judge direct the jury to ignore this evidence, or give an appropriate direction to prevent its misuse.  
     
      
       
      (a)(ii) 
       
      
    13 Having given the expanded evidence in cross-examination set out at [9] above, the complainant continued:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        And with that [Gail’s] out of the car and they’re fighting. He’s, she’s hitting him and he’s hitting her and he pushed her to the ground and then he’s over the top of, he was actually on top of her 
        --"" 
        
       
      
    14 The appellant’s solicitor intervened in the complainant’s answer, saying, “I’ll just stop you there”, and moved to question the complainant as to whether she had given her daughter and the appellant’s wife a detailed account of what had happened in the bedroom.  
     
      
    15 The appellant contends that the evidence of the fight between the appellant and his wife was irrelevant to the proof of the charge and had no probative value. It was submitted it had substantial prejudicial value, in that it portrayed the appellant as being a person of violent disposition and thus of bad character.  
     
      
    16 Apart from the intervention to which I have referred, the appellant’s solicitor did not object to this evidence, or ask that it be struck from the record as being non-responsive to his question. Nor did he ask the trial judge for a direction to be given to the jury to ignore the evidence. 
     
      
       
      (b) 
       
      
    17 The complainant’s daughter, in her examination in chief, also gave evidence of an altercation between the appellant and his wife. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…  
        Gail and [the appellant] ended up having, they were pushing each other around and saying, he, she was swearing at him. He was saying to her, ‘I’m finished with you, you’re nothing but’ – I’m sorry about my language – ‘a slut’ 
        ”.  
        
       
       
      The daughter’s evidence continued:  
       
       
        
        “And [the appellant’s wife] was saying,  
        ‘I don’t have my grandkids anymore because you’re a child molester’ 
        .”  
        
       
      
    18 The appellant complains this evidence was irrelevant and highly prejudicial; that it was evidence of tendency or propensity; that no notice had been given under s 97 of the Evidence Act; and that it was evidence of extreme bad character. He further contends that a direction should have been given by the trial judge to ignore the evidence.  
     
      
       
      (c) 
       
      
    19 A friend of the complainant, Ms Robertson, gave evidence that very late in the evening of 29 December 2003, the appellant’s wife, Gail, and the complainant came to her door. She had been with each earlier in the evening. Ms Robertson said the complainant was crying and told her what had happened between her and the appellant, namely, that the appellant had pushed her into the bedroom and tried to get on top of her. The Crown Prosecutor then asked whether the appellant’s wife had given Ms Robertson any more of an explanation as to what had been going on. Ms Robertson said “no”, because Gail was “really angry and upset”. Ms Robertson was asked what made her think that, to which she replied, “Well [the appellant’s wife] was yelling and screaming and they’d just had a fight”. (This was a reference to the fight between the appellant and his wife.)  
     
      
    20 The Crown Prosecutor asked, “What sort of things was she screaming, what was she saying?” to which Ms Robertson answered, “That he’s nothing – dirty, you know, mongrel and all that”. 
     
      
    21 Senior counsel for the appellant said that had complaint been in dispute in this matter, this evidence may have been admissible, as tending to support the evidence of complaint having been made to the appellant’s wife. That is the way the trial judge referred to it in his summing up. In this regard, although complaint was not at issue, the appellant’s solicitor had suggested to the jury that a complaint had not been made at the earliest opportunity, because the complainant had not given any detail to her daughter or to the appellant’s wife when she had met them in the street within minutes of the incident. The trial judge dealt with this in his summing up by asking the jury, rhetorically, whether it would be expected that the complainant would have given full details to the appellant’s wife. He then said:  
     
      
       
        
        “In any case, things developed quickly. It appears Mrs Steve gained some understanding of an event that had happened  
        because she immediately attacked her husband 
        .”  
        
       
      
    22 The appellant contends, however, that the question of complaint was not in dispute. The matter in dispute was the extent of the complaint, which was a matter bearing upon the complainant’s credibility. It was submitted that this aspect of Ms Robertson’s evidence had little probative value, but was highly prejudicial, raised bad character and, therefore, should have been rejected by the trial judge. Alternatively, the appellant’s solicitor should have sought that a direction be given to the jury to ignore the evidence.  
     
      
       
      (d)(i) 
       
      
    23 The next complaint relates to evidence given by the complainant’s brother, David Garner. Mr Garner gave evidence that the complainant’s daughter telephoned him and said something to the effect that the complainant wanted him to go and see her as, “someone tried to rape her and they grabbed her by the throat”. After receiving this telephone call, Mr Garner went to Ms Robertson’s place, where he understood the complainant, the appellant’s wife and the complainant’s daughter to be. He said that whilst he was there, the complainant told him that the appellant tried to rape her and that the other person present in the unit (Mr Pettiona) had a hammer beside the bed with which he threatened her. The complainant told him that when she attempted to leave, “two other blokes tried to chase her to help catch her”.  
     
      
    24 The appellant submitted this evidence was both irrelevant and highly prejudicial. It should have been objected to. Alternatively, the appellant’s solicitor should have sought that a direction be given to the jury to ignore the evidence.  
     
      
       
      (d)(ii) 
       
      
    25 Mr Garner also gave evidence that about an hour and a half after he had returned home, the appellant arrived and told him that he was going to “WA” (Western Australia) and said, “Thanks for being my friend, catch you later”.  
     
      
    26 It was submitted that the comment by the appellant that he was going to Western Australia was irrelevant, as it was not relied upon by the Crown as evidence of flight or an intention to flee. It was submitted that in any event, that evidence would not have been properly admissible on that basis and the appellant’s solicitor should have sought that the trial judge direct the jury either to ignore the evidence, or as to the use to which the evidence could be put.  
     
      
       
      (e) 
       
      
    27 The Crown Prosecutor, in his opening to the jury, stated the complainant had seen a claw hammer in the bedroom where the assault took place. In her evidence, the complainant said that when she was in the room she was scared, knowing there was another person in the lounge room and not knowing whether they had planned to assault her. The complainant said she was “thinking there’s a hammer there sitting beside the bed”. She said she did not know whether to scream and she did not know why the hammer was there. She said that “just heaps of stuff was going through my head”.  
     
      
    28 Mr Pettiona gave evidence that the hammer was his and that it was either on the bedside table or on the bed. He said he had the hammer to do running repairs on the doors in the apartment. He explained that he used to have to tap all the “pins” down (by which I understand him to mean the pins within the hinges of the door), because they popped up frequently. He said he assumed the hammer was in the bedroom because that was the last room that he had used it in.  
     
      
    29 There was no evidence that the appellant was aware of the presence of the hammer. He contends this evidence was irrelevant and in any event, its prejudicial value exceeded any probative value, which, on the appellant’s argument was nil. The appellant contended that his solicitor should have sought that the trial judge give a direction to the jury that this evidence be ignored, or at the least that there be a direction so as to ensure that this evidence not be misused.  
     
      
       
      Crown’s response to the admission of the above evidence 
       
      
    30 Crown counsel on the appeal conceded that most of the above evidence was irrelevant. He also accepted that it was possibly prejudicial. He submitted, however, that it cannot be known what tactical decisions are ever taken at trial and it was possible that objection might not have been taken to the evidence for tactical reasons. He suggested the appellant’s solicitor may have decided it was preferable for all of the evidence referred to above, which on its face was prejudicial, to go before the jury, so as to establish a case that the complainant’s version of events that night was improbable.  
     
      
    31 It was submitted that this was the likely tactical approach that had been taken, when regard was had to the appellant’s solicitor’s final address to the jury. In that address, the appellant’s solicitor had drawn the jury’s attention to the significant differences between the evidence of the various witnesses. When Mr Garner, the complainant’s brother, was told of the assault, his attitude was that the complainant should sort it out herself.  
     
      
    32 The appellant’s solicitor stated to the jury that commonsense would dictate that if something of that nature had happened to one’s sister, that would not be the attitude a brother would take. On the contrary, he would do something about it, whereas Mr Garner “did nothing”. (That statement was not accurate, as Mr Garner rang the police). The appellant’s solicitor then referred to the evidence set out at (d)(ii) above, where Mr Garner said the appellant had called to see him, to say he was going to Western Australia. The solicitor said to the jury (continuing the error he had already made as to the brother doing “nothing”): 
     
      
       
        
        “So [the appellant] goes around and sees [Mr Garner] and once again what happens, nothing, doesn’t do anything, doesn’t ring the police, doesn’t confront him, nothing. I mean that – if we accept his evidence you’d have to have some concerns. Obviously he wasn’t there but the other important point is that if the [appellant’s] guilty, and if the [appellant] has done it, why is he going to go around and say goodbye to the brother of the alleged victim about an hour-and-a-half after it’s happened, very difficult to accept.”  
        
       
      
    33 Crown counsel suggested that, overall, the appellant’s solicitor might not have objected to the evidence of which complaint is made, because he was seeking to gain a sympathy vote from the jury in response to the somewhat vicious attacks on the appellant’s character in the evidence. In this regard, the appellant was portrayed as a man who was unfaithful to his wife, had a history of “putting the hard word on” women, that is, that he was sexually predatory; that he was violent towards his wife; and was a paedophile. He submitted it was likely that the appellant’s solicitor had made such a tactical decision, given the reliance upon the evidence of the complainant’s brother that the appellant had told him he was going to Western Australia.  
     
      
    34 Crown counsel also pointed out that the only evidence of which complaint is now made, that was not contained in the brief of evidence, was the evidence of Ms Robertson that the appellant’s wife had called the appellant a “dirty … mongrel”. It was likely, therefore, that as the appellant’s solicitor had advance notice of the remainder of the evidence, he was not taken by surprise. It could be inferred, therefore, that he had taken a decision not to object to it. In short, this could be seen as part of the appellant’s solicitor’s tactical approach to the conduct of the case.  
     
      
       
      Principles governing a fair trial in the context of the competency of an accused person’s legal representation 
       
      
    35 Appeals against conviction are provided for by s 5 of the Criminal Appeal Act. Section 6(1) provides that on an appeal against conviction under s 5(1), the court shall allow the appeal “if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside … on any … ground whatsoever [where] there was a miscarriage of justice”. Section 6(1) is subject to the proviso that even if the points raised by the appeal are decided in favour of the appellant, the court may dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. This is commonly referred to as ‘the proviso’.  
     
      
    36 The precepts that only relevant evidence is admissible; that tendency evidence is inadmissible unless notice is given; that evidence of bad character is only admissible in well recognised circumstances; and that the court must refuse to admit evidence where the danger of unfair prejudice outweighs its probative value, are fundamental to a fair trial. The appellant’s overall contention on the appeal is that he was deprived of that fundamental right.  
     
      
    37 This contention raised two principal challenges to the sustainability of the verdict against him. First, the appellant’s complains that his legal representative at trial should have objected to the material set out in (a)-(e) above, or should have sought directions from the trial judge in respect of this evidence, that the jury ignore the evidence and/or seek directions to prevent the evidence being misused. It was submitted that his failure to do so demonstrated a high level of incompetence, such that the trial miscarried.  
     
      
    38 Secondly, the appellant contends that the trial judge failed to properly deal with the evidence in the trial, either by rejecting the evidence or, alternatively, by failing to give the jury appropriate directions to disregard the evidence of which complaint is made. 
     
      
    39 A cardinal principle of the adversary system of the legal process under which criminal trials are conducted is that, as a general rule, parties are bound by the manner in which they conduct those proceedings. This principle includes the manner in which the proceedings are conducted by a party’s legal representative. In R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677, Gleeson CJ pointed out, at 683:  
     
      
       
        
        “As a general rule, a party is bound by the conduct of his or her counsel, and counsel have a wide discretion as to the manner in which proceedings are conducted … The authorities concerning the rights and duties of counsel are replete with emphatic statements which stress both the independent role of the barrister and the binding consequences for the client of decisions taken by a barrister in the course of running a case.” 
        
       
      
    40 Importantly for present purposes, his Honour observed, at 684, that it was well settled that the incompetence of counsel at trial, of itself, will not attract appellate intervention. Nonetheless, the courts had always acknowledged the existence of a power and duty to quash a conviction in some cases. His Honour stated, at 685, that the relevant principles that applied where it was established that the accused person’s legal representation at trial was incompetent were: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. A Court of Criminal Appeal has a power and a duty to intervene in the case of a miscarriage of justice, but what amounts to a miscarriage of justice is something that has to be considered in the light of the way in which the system of criminal justice operates. 
         
         
        2. As a general rule an accused person is bound by the way the trial is conducted by counsel, regardless of whether that was in accordance with the wishes of the client, and it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. 
         
         
        3. However, there may arise cases where something has occurred in the running of a trial, perhaps as the result of ‘flagrant incompetence’ of counsel, or perhaps from some other cause, which will be recognised as involving, or causing, a miscarriage of justice. It is impossible, and undesirable, to attempt to define such cases with precision. When they arise they will attract appellate intervention.” 
        
       
      
    41 Senior counsel submitted that these principles have been consistently applied, save that, there is no necessity for an accused person to establish that his legal representative’s incompetence was properly characterised as “flagrant”. However, as will become apparent, the question is not whether conduct is ‘”flagrant”. Rather, the question is whether there has been a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    42 In TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; (2002) 212 CLR 124 Gaudron J, at [31], stated that the question is whether some act or omission in the trial resulted in a miscarriage of justice. McHugh J, at [74] ff, examined the circumstances in which it could be said there was a miscarriage of justice by reason of counsel’s conduct and, in particular, the standard for determining whether counsel’s conduct constituted a material irregularity. His Honour stated that whatever description is given to counsel’s conduct, the question was whether the act or omission of counsel has resulted in an unfair trial.  
     
      
    43 McHugh J stated, at [76], that if an accused person has been deprived of a fair trial according to law, that constitutes a miscarriage of justice. His Honour concluded in this regard that where a trial had been unfair, the accused should not have to show that counsel’s conduct might have affected the result, because no matter how strong the prosecution case appears to be, “an accused person is entitled to the trial that the law requires”. His Honour explained however, at [77], that in probably the majority of cases, even if the conduct of counsel is irregular, that will not necessarily deprive the accused person of a fair trial: “Not every error makes the trial unfair”. However, he noted that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a miscarriage of justice always occurs when there is a  
        significant possibility  
        that a material irregularity at the trial has resulted in the conviction of an accused person: see  
        Ratten v The Queen  
        [1974] HCA 35; (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 516.” (Emphasis added)  
        
       
      
    44 In discussing what standard was to be applied in determining whether counsel’s conduct was a material irregularity, McHugh J said, at [79]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The critical issue in an appeal like the present is not whether counsel erred in some way but whether a miscarriage of justice has occurred. However, ‘whether counsel has been negligent or otherwise remiss ... remains relevant as an intermediate or subsidiary issue’:  
        R v Scott 
         (1996) 137 ALR 347 at 362. That is because the issue of miscarriage of justice in such cases ordinarily subsumes two issues. First, did counsel's conduct result in a material irregularity in the trial? Second, is there a significant possibility that the irregularity affected the outcome? Whether a material irregularity occurred must be considered in light of the wide discretion that counsel has to conduct the trial as he or she thinks best and the fact that ordinarily the client is bound by the decisions of counsel. Accordingly, ‘it is not a ground for setting aside a conviction that decisions made by counsel were made without, or contrary to, instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence’:  
        R v Birks 
         (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 at 685. The appellant must show that the failing or error of counsel was a material irregularity and that there is a significant possibility that it affected the outcome of the trial.” 
        
       
      
    45 At [80], his Honour posed the question as to the circumstances in which an appellant would be able to discharge what his Honour described as “the heavy burden of establishing that counsel's conduct constituted a material irregularity amounting to a miscarriage of justice”. McHugh J considered that “flagrant incompetence” was a likely circumstance in establishing a material irregularity such as to provide the stepping stone to a finding of a miscarriage of justice. It will not be sufficient to show that forensic decisions were made in respect of which competent counsel would have differing views as to their suitability: see [81].  
     
      
    46 In Ali v R [2005] HCA 8; (2005) 214 ALR 1 the appellant appealed against his conviction on the basis that there had been a miscarriage of justice in that he was not tried fairly because of the incompetence of trial counsel. Callinan and Heydon JJ (with whose reasons Gleeson CJ agreed in a separate judgment) noted, at [99], that many decisions made in the course of a trial, including tactical decisions, are often made hurriedly or intuitively. Other difficult decisions often needed to be made as a trial unfolded. Their Honours stated that it was in the light of such matters that an evaluation had to be made as to whether: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the conduct [of trial counsel] produced a miscarriage of justice, that is, whether it deprived the accused of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open. As Gaudron J in  
        TKWJ v The Queen 
         said:  
         
         
          
          ‘[W]hether there has been a miscarriage of justice is usually answered by asking whether the act or omission in question 'deprived the accused of a chance of acquittal that was fairly open'. The word 'fairly' should not be overlooked. A decision to take or refrain from taking a particular course which is explicable on the basis that it has or could have led to a forensic advantage may well have the consequence that a chance of acquittal that might otherwise have been open was not, in the circumstances, fairly open.  
          
         
         
          
          One matter should be noted with respect to the question whether counsel's conduct is explicable on the basis that it resulted or could have resulted in a forensic advantage. That is an objective test.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    47 Their Honours concluded, at [100], that it had not been demonstrated that any conduct on the part of counsel had deprived the accused of a fair chance of acquittal. 
     
      
    48 Hayne J (with whom McHugh J agreed) stated, at [23], that the fact that counsel could have taken an objection to evidence does not demonstrate either that counsel was incompetent or that there had been a miscarriage of justice. Rather, the question was whether counsel should have objected. His Honour adverted, at [110], to his conclusion in TKWJ that the question of miscarriage does not depend upon a factual inquiry as to why counsel acted in a particular way. He explained, at [25]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Rather, the question is whether there  
        could 
         be a reasonable explanation for the course that was adopted at trial. If there could be such an explanation, it follows from the fundamental nature of a criminal trial as an adversarial and accusatorial process that no miscarriage of justice is shown to have occurred.” (Citations omitted) 
        
       
       
      Then, importantly, his Honour stated, at [26]: 
       
       
        
        “… when considering whether a failure to object to evidence has brought about a miscarriage, it is necessary to consider the effect of the evidence which it is said trial counsel could have had adduced in a different form or could have prevented being led.” 
        
       
      
    49 In Nudd v R [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614; 162 A Crim R 301, Gleeson CJ, at [7], explained the concept of miscarriage of justice in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The concept of miscarriage of justice is as wide as the potential for error. Indeed, it is wider; for not all miscarriages involve error. Process is related to outcome, in that the object of due process is to secure a just result. Justice, however, means justice according to law, and the observance of the requirements of law according to which a criminal trial is to be conducted has a public as well as a private purpose. An unjust conviction is one form of miscarriage. Another is a failure of process of such a kind that it is impossible for an appellate court to decide whether a conviction is just.  
        Another is a failure of process which departs from the essential requirements of a fair trial.”  
        (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    50 His Honour observed, at [8], that where it is claimed that an appellant has not had a fair trial, then the court is primarily concerned with “what happened at, or in relation to, the trial”, rather than why it happened. Thus: 
     
      
       
        
        “… where the conduct of counsel, as a participant in the trial process, is said to give rise to, or to be involved in, a miscarriage of justice, ordinarily it was what was done or omitted that is of significance, rather than why that occurred.” 
        
       
       
      In other words, it is the “ 
      fairness of the process that is in question, not the wisdom of counsel 
      ”: [9]. Gleeson CJ reiterated the general rule that counsel’s decisions bind the client. His Honour stressed the nature of the adversarial system and observed that the fairness of the process was to be judged in that light. Accordingly, a complaint that counsel’s conduct resulted in an unfair trial, is considered, at least in most cases, by reference to “ 
      an objective standard 
      ”.  
       
      
    51 In Nudd, it was accepted that there could be rare cases in which counsel’s misbehaviour or ineptitude was so extreme as to constitute a denial of due process. Gleeson CJ adopted the two examples given by McHugh J in TKWJ, namely, where for no valid reason, counsel failed to cross-examine a material witness, or did not address the jury. Gleeson CJ noted that he understood McHugh J to be referring to cases where there was no rational explanation for counsel’s decision, not merely to a case where an appellate court might consider it had been unwise for counsel to adopt a particular course. 
     
      
    52 Gleeson CJ considered the case against the appellant in Nudd to be so overwhelming, that there could not have been any real doubt as to the appellant’s guilt. His Honour concluded, at [20], that there was no failure of process that departed from the essential requirements of a fair trial.  
     
      
    53 Gummow and Hayne JJ also emphasised that the question was whether or not there had been a miscarriage of justice and said that it was important for a court not to be distracted by questions of whether or not trial counsel’s conduct was appropriately described as, for example, incompetent with or without some emphatic term such as “flagrantly”. Their Honours stated, at [24]: 
     
      
       
        
        Alleging that trial counsel was incompetent does not reveal what is said to be the miscarriage of justice. That requires consideration of what did or did not occur at the trial:  
        TKWJ v The Queen  
        [2002] HCA 46; (2002) 212 CLR 124 at 134 [31] per Gaudron J, of whether there was a material irregularity in the trial: at 149-150 [79] per McHugh J, and whether there was a significant possibility that the acts or omissions of which complaint is made affected the outcome of the trial: at 135 [33] per Gaudron J, 149 [79] per McHugh J, 157 [101] per Gummow J, 157 [104] per Hayne J.” 
        
       
      
    54 Kirby J considered there were cases where it was not necessary to prove that the outcome would have been different, but for the incompetence of counsel. His Honour concluded, at [100], that there were rare cases where legal representation may have been of such a quality, either because there may have been misbehaviour, errors or incompetence in the legal representation of an accused at trial that was so egregious, frequent or obvious as to amount to a miscarriage of justice. His Honour observed that 
     
      
       
        
        “The ‘proviso’ postulates upholding the verdict at the conclusion of a trial that has met the minimum standards required for a fair trial. It does not envisage the affront to the appearance of justice of upholding orders that have followed a proceeding that did not amount, in law, to a proper trial at all …” 
        
       
      
    55 Callinan and Heydon JJ were of the opinion that on any assessment, whether subjective or objective, counsel’s conduct in that case was incompetent to a serious degree. Nonetheless, their Honours concluded, at [162], that the appellant was not deprived of a chance of acquittal, because the Crown case against him was, effectively, unanswerable. 
     
      
    56 There are numerous other cases dealing with the incompetence of legal representation. I will refer only to Seymour v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 206; 162 A Crim R 576 where Hunt AJA (Simpson and Rothman JJ agreeing) said:  
     
      
       
        
        “[20] It is, however, important to note that such a ground of appeal neither requires nor permits an inquiry into the competence of the counsel in question; what must be established is the objective fact that there was a miscarriage of justice as a result of counsel’s conduct, in the sense that there has been a loss of a chance of acquittal which was fairly open to the accused:

        [21] Relevant to the existence of a miscarriage of justice in the particular trial are the issues of whether the conduct of counsel represented a legitimate choice a competent counsel could fairly make in the circumstances of that trial and whether, viewed objectively, it was a rational tactical decision in the particular forensic situation in which it was made. When that situation is examined, issues such as the forensic advantage which may have been sought and possible prejudice which may have been caused by counsel’s conduct are relevant but not necessarily decisive considerations:

    57 This summary was adopted by this Court in Mouroufas v R [2007] NSWCCA 58; Rolfe v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 155; (2007) 173 A Crim R 168. 
     
      
       
      Was the evidence admissible and/or prejudicial? 
       
      
    58 There will be no miscarriage of justice if evidence is properly admitted. In this case it was conceded that the evidence of which complaint is made was not relevant. Accordingly, it was not admissible. However, as is apparent from the foregoing that is not the test for determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. Rather, it is necessary to consider what effect the wrongly admitted evidence, (or other error at trial) had on the outcome of the trial.  
     
      
    59 In this case, the appellant contends that the evidence of which he complains falls into one or more of the following categories: evidence that was irrelevant; evidence that was prejudicial; tendency or coincidence evidence; and evidence of bad character.  
     
      
    60 As to (a)(i): The evidence that the appellant’s wife, Gail, said to the complainant, “He’s put the hard word on you, hasn’t he?” and “It’s okay, he’s done it before” was prejudicial. Unless it was relied upon as tendency evidence, it was irrelevant and was therefore inadmissible: Evidence Act, s 55. Even if some basis of relevance could be found (other than as tendency or propensity evidence) the evidence was prejudicial. The trial judge was under an obligation to refuse to admit the evidence, if its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant: Evidence Act, s 137. Section 137 is mandatory in its terms and is not dependant upon objection being taken to the admission of the evidence. As Heydon JA (as his Honour then was), stated in R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 186; (2002) 130 A Crim R 44, at 47: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the terms of [s 137] are mandatory. They must be complied with whether or not a party who might gain from their invocation actually invokes them. It is notable that Pt 3.11 (in which s 137 appears) … [is] not listed as among the provisions which the court may, with the parties’ consent, dispense with: s 190.” 
        
       
      
    61 In my opinion, this evidence fell into that category of evidence that should have been excluded under s 137. It was evidence that characterised the appellant as a sexual predator. As such, it was evidence of bad character and was the type of evidence that could and most likely would have influenced the jury’s determination in circumstances where the case depended upon the credibility of the complainant, to more readily accept her evidence.  
     
      
    62 The only possible relevance of this evidence was as tendency or propensity evidence. However, notice had not been served on the accused of the intention to use the evidence as tendency or propensity evidence: Evidence Act, s 97; Evidence Regulation 2005, cl 5. Section 97 provides that such evidence is not admissible in the absence of notice, unless the court dispenses with the notice requirements: Evidence Act, s 100. There was no such dispensation.  
     
      
    63 I deal separately with the admission of evidence of bad character below. 
     
      
    64 As to (a)(ii) and (c): The evidence of the fight between the appellant and his wife was not relevant. It was not argued that it was part of the res gestae. It was evidence of bad character because it indicated that the appellant was prepared to be violent towards women and was thus prejudicial. The prejudicial value of this evidence became more apparent during the trial, when the complainant expanded upon the details of the assault, stating that the appellant “was just like an animal”; he “was pulling my face, my hair”; he was “pulling me by the hair”; and that he “pulled me down by the hair”.  
     
      
    65 No previous complaint had been made that the appellant had been pulling the complainant’s hair and the description of him being “like an animal” had not been given before the trial. It was possible, indeed likely, that the jury would use this evidence of bad character as support for the complainant’s evidence that the appellant had been violent towards her, which, on her account, occurred during the course of the sexual assault. The jury was likely, therefore, to have treated the evidence of bad character as directly supporting the complainant’s evidence of the sexual assault. 
     
      
    66 As to (b): The evidence given by the claimant’s daughter, in which she stated that the appellant’s wife had said to the accused, “I don’t have my grandkids anymore because you’re a child molester”, was highly prejudicial. It was not relevant. Even if arguably relevant, it had no or little probative value and the trial judge was required to reject it given its highly prejudicial nature: Evidence Act, s 137.  
     
      
    67 It was also evidence of extreme bad character. Stated in general terms, the evidence of the bad character of an accused person is not relevant to the guilt of the accused of the particular crime with which that person is charged. The prosecution may only raise the bad character of the accused to negate evidence that the accused person adduces of good character: Evidence Act, s 110.  
     
      
    68 In R v Stalder [1981] NSWLR 2, Street CJ (Begg and Yeldham JJ agreeing), considered the limitations on the admissibility of rebuttal evidence as to bad character by the Crown, in accordance with s 412 of the Crimes Act (see now s 110 of the Evidence Act). His Honour stated, at 15: 
     
      
       
        
        “These prescriptions of the effect and scope of character evidence do not override the deeply rooted common law principle precluding the Crown from calling evidence of bad character solely for the purpose of seeking to establish affirmatively as part of its case in chief that the accused is a person of bad character and hence could be regarded as more likely to have committed the crime with which he is charged.” 
        
       
       
      Later, at 18, his Honour stated:  
       
       
        
        “The section has … been from the inception of its precursor in 1876 construed with due regard to the common law principle denying to the Crown freedom to call evidence of bad character to establish the likelihood of guilt … This basic principle of the common law is also to be found in the restriction placed upon the legitimate use of evidence of bad character called in rebuttal of evidence of good character … The Crown is entitled to take up this issue and to attempt to negate it by evidence of bad character. The Crown is not, however, entitled to assert a counter proposition of likelihood of guilt. These considerations underlie significantly both the desirability of juries being carefully instructed upon the legitimate use which can be made of the rebutting evidence of bad character and the approach to be taken by a trial judge in ruling upon the discretionary objection based upon unduly prejudicial significance of evidence of bad character.” 
        
       
      
    69 As I have said, this was evidence of extreme bad character, the prejudicial value of which was immense. It had had no probative value. The trial judge was obliged to reject the evidence, regardless of the failure of the appellant’s solicitor to object to it.  
     
      
    70 As to (d)(i): The evidence of the complainant’s brother of the telephone call from the complainant’s daughter was also evidence of violence, although it should be noted that the complainant did not give evidence of being “grabbed by the throat”. Nor did the complainant’s daughter give evidence that she had made any such statement. The brother’s evidence was hearsay and was evidence of bad character. If it was intended to be relied upon as proof of complaint, then it was incumbent upon the trial judge to determine, pursuant to s 137, whether its probative value was outweighed by its prejudicial value. 
     
      
    71 It is possible that the appellant’s solicitor did not object to this evidence, preferring to take a tactical stance that this was another aspect of the evidence that was inconsistent and embellished, so as to support a submission to the jury that the Crown witnesses should not be believed. However, the solicitor made no reference to this evidence in his address to the jury, notwithstanding that he emphasised the inconsistencies in other parts of the evidence. 
     
      
    72 Although this was evidence of bad character, it would not, in my opinion, have been sufficient to establish a miscarriage of justice. Further, I am of the opinion that the failure to object to this evidence is not the makeweight that establishes that there was, overall, a miscarriage of justice. Accordingly, I would leave this particular complaint to one side in determining whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    73 As to (d)(ii): The evidence that the appellant went around to the complainant’s brother’s house some hours after the incident and said he was going to Western Australia was not relied upon by the Crown as evidence of flight or of an intention to flee. Rather, it was merely relied upon as evidence of what occurred later on some hours after the incident. In my opinion, unless it was relied upon as evidence of flight, it was irrelevant and inadmissible.  
     
      
    74 The Crown conceded as much in its submissions on the appeal. However, the appellant’s solicitor, in his address to the jury, relied upon the evidence to portray the complainant’s version of events as improbable. The Crown thus asserts that the appellant’s solicitor’s failure to object to this evidence should be seen as part of the tactical decisions made by him at trial.  
     
      
    75 In my opinion, this is not only a reasonable assumption, it is significantly supported by the manner in which the appellant’s solicitor referred to this evidence in his address to the jury. In any event, I am of the opinion that this was evidence about which different trial advocates could take differing positions. Accordingly, there was no miscarriage of justice in the admission of this evidence. Rather, it is one matter in respect of which the appellant is bound by the conduct of his solicitor, in accordance with the principles discussed above. 
     
      
    76 As to (e): The other evidence of which complaint is made is the evidence of the hammer in the room. The complaint made by the appellant, that his Honour failed to deal with the innocent explanation as to why there was a hammer in the bedroom, is not made out. His Honour summarised Mr Pettiona’s evidence on this matter. However, there is still a question whether the evidence should not have been admitted, pursuant to the operation of s 137. Given that Mr Pettiona’s evidence was before the jury, I would not have necessarily concluded that this evidence needed to be excluded under s 137.  
     
      
       
      Was there a miscarriage of justice? 
       
      
    77 Nothing is known about the appellant’s legal representative at trial other than that he was a country solicitor. Nor does the Court have any understanding as to why he did not object to the challenged evidence. There was no evidence before the Court from the solicitor or the appellant as to the running of the trial.  
     
      
    78 However, it is apparent from the solicitor’s address to the jury that he had made tactical decisions both during the course of his trial and in his address to the jury. One tactical decision that he made, that is obvious from the transcript of his address to the jury, was a decision not to cross-examine the complainant’s brother. The appellant’s solicitor referred to this in his address to the jury when, having given an overview of the evidence to that point, he said:  
     
      
       
        
        “Now so we’re now back at [Ms Robertson’s] and that I think of all the evidence that we’ve heard … and this was I think  
        that some of you looked somewhat aghast when [Mr Garner] being the brother of [the complainant] gave evidence and he wasn’t cross-examined by me 
         because the other witnesses had been cross-examined, he gave very short evidence and he wasn’t cross-examined by me at all.” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    79 The other tactical decision that is apparent from his address to the jury, was that the appellant’s solicitor relied upon the fact the complainant’s version of events had expanded, from the time the appellant’s wife and her own daughter stopped the car in the street, to the version of the complaint that she gave to the police. The appellant’s solicitor emphasised this to the jury, before dealing with the evidence of the complainant’s brother. Overall, the picture that emerges from the address to the jury is that the solicitor was implying that there was some hysteria on the part of the female witnesses.  
     
      
    80 It is also apparent from the manner in which the solicitor dealt with the brother’s evidence, that he relied on it to demonstrate that nothing criminal had happened between the appellant and the complainant. It is probable, therefore, as I have already indicated, that a tactical decision was made in relation to this evidence. The appellant should be bound by that decision because its admission did not result in any miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    81 However, the same cannot be said in respect of the evidence in (a)(i); (a)(ii); (b); and (c). This evidence was prejudicial, as I have explained. The consequence of the admission of that evidence was that the jury was left with evidence that the appellant was a person of a violent disposition towards women, with a history (albeit non-specific) of “putting the hard word on” women, and who was a “paedophile”, which meant his wife could not see her grandchildren. These aspects of the evidence should have been objected to by the appellant’s solicitor.  
     
      
    82 Further, the trial judge had an obligation not to admit the evidence that I have identified in respect of which there was a danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant, which outweighed its probative value, if any. The trial judge failed to undertake the mandatory task required by s 137 not to admit this evidence. As a result of that failure in the trial process, prejudicial evidence was before the jury and was likely to be used by them in determining the guilt of the appellant.  
     
      
    83 Accordingly, I consider that there was a miscarriage of justice in that evidence being adduced.  
     
      
       
      Was the verdict unsafe and unsatisfactory? 
       
      
    84 The appellant contends that the case against him was not so strong that it was likely he would have been convicted in any event. He contends, therefore, that he lost a reasonable chance of acquittal.  
     
      
    85 The Crown case required the acceptance of the complainant’s evidence. Her evidence was unsupported by the witness Steve Pettiona. Although there was evidence of immediate complaint, that complaint was responsive to a question asked by the appellant’s wife and the complaint was not made in any detail. The detail did not emerge until the complainant spoke to the police. Even then, the complainant expanded upon the extent of the violence used in her evidence.  
     
      
    86 There were significant inconsistencies in the evidence of the other witnesses. Some of these have been adverted to above. It is, of course, usual for evidence to vary from witness to witness. People observe and remember events and conversations in differing degrees of detail. Part of the dynamics of a trial is the working out of whether evidence is so different as to not be credible. In this case, however, the effect of the inadmissible evidence was that the jury were left with the portrayal of a man who had violent and sexually predatory tendencies and was a child molester. It is highly likely that this evidence would have influenced the jury’s determination as to whether they believed the complainant. It follows, in my opinion, there was a high likelihood that the inadmissible evidence affected the outcome of the trial.  
     
      
    87 Having regard to the prejudicial nature of the evidence that was admitted, the Court cannot be satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred. The appeal, therefore, should be allowed, the conviction quashed and a new trial ordered.  
     
      
       
      Other grounds of appeal 
       
      
    88 There were two other grounds of appeal with which I should deal briefly. The first was a complaint that Senior Constable Harper should not have been permitted to read from a statement that he had made on 7 January 2004. The Crown Prosecutor sought leave that Senior Constable Harper refresh his memory in accordance with s 32 of the Evidence Act in regards to what was in his statement. The statement had been prepared from the notes he had taken when he interviewed the complainant at Ms Robertson’s home in the early hours of the morning of 30 December 2003. He said he did not take down the exact conversation he had with the complainant at that time: “It was just a rough version of the incident”. His notebook was not available and the appellant’s solicitor indicated that in that circumstance, “it was a bit difficult”, as he could not compare the difference between what was in the notebook and what was in the statements.  
     
      
    89 The trial judge indicated that the statement was admissible under s 32 of the Evidence Act and granted leave pursuant to this section. This, in fact, was an error. The relevant section is s 33, which makes specific provision for evidence given by a police officer and provides that despite the constraints on a witness reviving a memory by the use of an earlier produced document pursuant to s 32, “a police officer may give evidence in chief for the prosecution by reading or being led through a written statement previously made by the police officer”. The evidence may only be given if the statement was made “at the time of or soon after the occurrence of the events to which it refers”: s 33(2)(a).  
     
      
    90 Senior counsel for the appellant did not contend that a statement made about eight days after the incident was not sufficiently contemporaneous so as to fall outside s 33(2)(a). The submission on this particular challenge was not clear. It seems that the way the matter was eventually put is that it was a hearsay statement. However, the evidence was admitted as evidence of complaint and no error has been demonstrated in allowing the police officer to read from the statement. It was within the trial judge’s discretion to allow Senior Constable Harper to read from the statement: see Chisari v R (No 2) [2006] NSWCCA 325 per Grove J (with whom Kirby J and Hislop J agreed), at [28]-[30]. 
     
      
    91 The second complaint related to an irregularity at trial, when a portion of a transcript of the appellant’s ERISP, which was irrelevant and in respect of which the taped version was not played to the jury, was provided to the jury. The jury had been given the transcript to enable them to follow the tape recording as it was being played, if they so wished. During the playing of the tape, a decision was made not to play it in its entirety. However, the jury already had the transcript of the whole tape. 
     
      
    92 The jury was asked to return the transcript so that the irrelevant material could be removed. The appellant submits that the appellant’s solicitor failed to seek a discharge of the jury or directions from the trial judge to the jury regarding material not before them. The appellant further submits the trial judge should have directed the jury to put out of their minds anything they may have read in the material that was removed. His Honour did not do so, but simply told the jury that the end of the transcript was missing and a decision had been made not to play the balance of the tape to them because it contained material that was irrelevant and did not take the matter any further.  
     
      
    93 It was submitted that as a consequence of the above matters, the accused lost a chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted. 
     
      
    94 In the portion of the ERISP that was not played to the jury, the appellant had been asked questions as to whether he had an argument with his wife and whether there had been a physical altercation; whether he had hit his wife the previous evening; whether he had ever hit his wife in the past; whether he had ever grabbed his wife in a physical manner during an argument; whether he had cheated on his wife over the past 13 years; and whether he had taken any illegal substance the previous evening.  
     
      
    95 In my opinion, some of this material was prejudicial and ought to have been the subject of a direction to the jury that should they have read further than the tape was played, it was not part of the evidence in the trial and they should ignore it. However, having regard to the conclusion I have reached as to the outcome of this appeal, it is not necessary to finally make a decision as to whether that failure of its own would have been sufficient to require a new trial. When it is added into the matters to which I have already referred, it is another aspect of the trial that was unfair and the appellant was deprived of a fair chance of an acquittal.  
     
      
    96 Accordingly, I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      2. Quash the jury’s verdict of conviction given on 5 February 2007; 
       
       
      3. Order that there be a new trial. 
       
      
    97 HISLOP J: I agree with Beazley JA. 
     
      
    98 PRICE J: I agree with Beazley JA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This is a Crown appeal against the inadequacy of sentences imposed on the respondent for a number of offences. The sentences were imposed in the District Court on 18 December 2007. The Director filed a Notice of Appeal dated 6 February 2008, which was served on the respondent on 7 February 2008. The Director had previously advised the respondent by letter that he was considering an appeal. That letter was dated 15 January 2008 and was apparently received by the respondent on 22 January 2008. 
     
      
    2 The respondent pleaded guilty to and was sentenced in respect of the following offences: 
     
      
       
      (i) Armed robbery (s 97(1)  
      Crimes Act  
      1900, maximum penalty 20 years). Sentence: fixed term 15 months imprisonment to date from 9 March 2006; 
       
       
      (ii) Armed robbery (s 97(1)  
      Crimes Act  
      1900, maximum penalty 20 years). Sentence: fixed term 15 months imprisonment to date from 9 June 2006; 
       
       
      (iii) Aggravated car-jacking (s 154C(2)  
      Crimes Act  
      1900, maximum penalty 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 5 years). Sentence: 5 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months to date from 9 December 2006; 
       
       
      (iv) Robbery armed with a dangerous weapon (s 97(2)  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 maximum penalty 25 years). Sentence: 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months to date from 9 December 2007; 
       
       
      (v) Specially aggravated break enter and steal (s 112(3)  
      Crimes Act  
      1900, maximum penalty 25 years standard non-parole period 7 years). Sentence: 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years to date from 9 December 2008. 
       
      
    3 The aggregate sentence imposed was 10 years and 9 months. The effective non-parole period was 6 years and 9 months. 
     
      
    4 The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 25% for the early plea of guilty. Because of the respondent’s relative youth, the fact that it was his first time in custody, the partial accumulation of the sentences, and his need for a longer non-parole period to enable him to deal with illicit substance issues, his Honour found special circumstances. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    5 The first two offences were both committed on 2 August 2005. The first offence occurred between 8.00 and 8.30 pm when the respondent robbed a pizza delivery person as he was returning to his vehicle after completing a delivery. The respondent approached the driver’s side door of the vehicle and said, “Give me the bag. Don’t yell.” At the same time the respondent held a silver bladed knife of about 15 cm length to his victim who handed him the money pouch containing $101. The respondent escaped from the scene in a motor vehicle driven by Rouni Al-Khalil.  
     
      
    6 The second offence occurred between 9.30 and 10.00 pm and was also a robbery of a pizza delivery person. The delivery person returned to his vehicle and the respondent and Al-Khalil approached his driver’s window. The respondent produced a knife. The victim tried to move the knife away with his left hand and sustained a small cut to a finger. Al-Khalil and the respondent held the victim’s right arm so he could not move and the respondent put the blade of the knife against the victim’s neck and said, “Hurry up, I don’t have time.” The victim handed over the sum of $70. 
     
      
    7 The respondent was arrested for these offences on 5 August 2005. Al-Khalil had previously been arrested and made full admissions. Al-Khalil accepted responsibility for organising the robberies and driving the get-away vehicle. 
     
      
    8 When first interviewed the respondent denied knowledge of either of the robberies. However, a short time later he completed an interview in which he made full admissions. 
     
      
    9 The third offence was committed on Sunday 9 April 2006. The victim had taken her vehicle to a car wash in South Strathfield. After it had been cleaned and she was waiting for her car to be reversed from the car wash the respondent and a co-offender, who was carrying a gun, approached the car and forcibly removed the car wash employee from it. The gun was pointed in the employee’s face. When the owner of the car protested the gun was pointed at her chest. The respondent and his co-offender then drove off in the car. The car was later recovered. The car key was found in the possession of the respondent. 
     
      
    10 The fourth offence occurred on 9 October 2006 when the respondent, armed with a long barrelled revolver, robbed a “cash in transit” security guard. The victim had just collected cash from the McDonalds at Enfield and had transferred it to his private vehicle. The respondent and a co-offender approached the victim’s car on a motorcycle. The respondent approached the driver’s door and pointed the gun whilst demanding money. The victim handed over $29,000 and the respondent and his co-offender fled on the motorcycle. 
     
      
    11 The fifth offence was committed on 29 September 2006. The respondent and a co-offender accessed a flat where the respondent produced a gun which he used to threaten the occupants. The respondent and his co-offender demanded access to the family safe. The 17 year old member of the family was grabbed by the respondent who held a gun to his head. He was forced to his knees and the respondent put the pistol to the back of his head before discharging a round in close proximity to the boy. During these events the co-offender was saying, “Pop him, pop him.” Not surprisingly there was evidence that the young man thought he was going to die. The bullet hit the ground nearby. The respondent continued to hold the gun to the head of the boy until they were given access to the safe. The respondent and his co-offender stole a .270 calibre rifle, a box containing approximately $20,000 in Australian currency, 3,000 in Euros and assorted jewellery. 
     
      
       
      Matters of history 
       
      
    12 The respondent was arrested late in the evening of 5 August 2005 in relation to counts 1 and 2 and granted conditional bail the following day. He was arrested on 4 November 2005, after he failed to appear at court, and his bail was continued with the same conditions. His bail was again breached on 19 January 2006 and he was returned to custody. On 1 February 2006, after being committed for sentence on counts 1 and 2, bail being refused, the respondent was incorrectly released from custody. It was during this time that he committed the third offence. He remained at large until 14 April 2006 when he was returned to custody and refused bail. 
     
      
    13 On 28 July 2006 he appeared before the sentencing judge and was given a bond pursuant to s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 in relation to counts 1 and 2. He was released from custody. It was while he was subject to this bond that the respondent committed counts 4 and 5. 
     
      
    14 The respondent was arrested on 12 October 2006 in relation to count 4 and has been in continuous custody since that date. He was charged in relation to counts 3 and 5 on 17 January 2007. 
     
      
       
      Subjective matters 
       
      
    15 The respondent was born on 2 July 1986. Following his release on 28 July 2006 he married. He now has a son by that union. The respondent is the youngest of 6 children. But for a brother, he was not close to his siblings. His parents were elderly when he was born and he received little guidance from them. 
     
      
    16 By 13 years of age the respondent regularly stayed away from home and engaged in anti-social behaviour with older friends. He found acceptance with his anti-social peers and fell into inappropriate conduct ultimately leading to criminal behaviour. 
     
      
    17 For a time he lived with his brother in Tasmania but found this boring and returned to live with his parents in Sydney. He struggled at school and dropped out in Year 9. He had been suspended from school at times for acts of violence and use of illicit substances. 
     
      
    18 At age 15 he began work as a panel beater. However he misbehaved at TAFE and was asked to leave within 1 month of the course starting. He was sacked from his employment for fighting with customers and has not been employed since. 
     
      
    19 The respondent commenced using cannabis at age 13, ecstasy at age 15 and was a heavy user of ‘Ice’ (crystal methamphetamine) by age 17. He turned to using cocaine and by age 19 frequently ingested large quantities of that drug. He also took to drinking alcohol to excess. 
     
      
    20 The respondent has had some health issues. In 2005 he was hospitalised for an extended period of time due to the collapse of both of his lungs. He has also experienced a number of drug induced psychoses and at times has behaved in a bizarre fashion. He reported to a psychologist that he was under the influence of illicit substances and alcohol at the time of committing these offences. His level of intellectual functioning is assessed as borderline with his skills being superior to only 3% of the population. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    21 The sentencing judge found that there were aggravating features in relation to counts 1 and 2. The offences were committed in company and the victims were vulnerable. However, his Honour was satisfied that the respondent had entered an early plea and was entitled to the full utilitarian discount of 25%. He also found that at the time of these two offences, the respondent was a person without prior criminal convictions. His Honour said that he would take into account the guideline judgments in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 in relation to robberies and R v Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435; (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 in relation to break, enter and steal offences. His Honour observed that the respondent had spent 633 days in custody at the time he was sentenced and accordingly back-dated the sentence to 9 March 2006.  
     
      
    22 In respect of the aggravated car-jacking offence his Honour noted that it was committed when the respondent was at large, having been incorrectly released from custody. His Honour found the respondent’s role to be less than his co-offender, the latter having presented the gun and made the direct threats. He found the offence to be just below the mid-range of objective seriousness. However, his Honour found, as an aggravating factor, that it was a planned enterprise and that the respondent was in company. His Honour did not refer to the threatened use of the gun as an aggravating factor. This may have been because he regarded it as an element of the aggravated offence and could not be taken into account twice.  
     
      
    23 In relation to the offence of specially aggravated break, enter and steal (home invasion) his Honour found that the offence fell within the mid-range of objective criminality. His Honour noted as aggravating features that the offence was planned and that the respondent was on bail, which had been granted shortly before the offence was committed. His Honour found that an element of the aggravated offence was that the respondent was armed with a dangerous weapon and accordingly his Honour did not refer to this aspect as a matter of aggravation. His Honour accepted that the impact on each of the three victims was substantial and took this into account as an aggravating factor under s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. His Honour had regard to the fact that there was a “small amount of violence and certainly a significant threat” and that there were multiple victims. In mitigation, his Honour had regard to the early plea of guilty.  
     
      
    24 In relation to the offence of armed robbery of the security guard, his Honour noted that it was committed shortly after the respondent had been released on bail to attend an anger management course. His Honour noted as the aggravating factors of the offence that it was committed in company, that there was clear planning, that the respondent was on bail and that a large amount of cash was taken. In mitigation his Honour was again mindful of the early plea of guilty. His Honour said that he had regard to the Henry guideline. However, his Honour could not conclude that the respondent was unlikely to re-offend or even that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      The Crown appeal 
       
      
    25 The Crown submitted that the sentences imposed by his Honour were manifestly inadequate and fail to reflect the objective criminality of each of the offences. It is further submitted that the resulting aggregate sentence, and non-parole period, do not adequately reflect the totality of the respondent’s criminality. 
     
      
    26 It is submitted that the following errors can be identified: 
     
      
       
      1. Misapplication of the guideline judgment in  
      Henry. 
       
      2. Failure to properly assess the objective seriousness of the offences of aggravated car-jacking and specially aggravated break, enter and steal for the purpose of consideration of the standard non-parole period as a guidepost. 
       
      3. Failure to comply with  
      Pearce v The Queen  
      [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610; 103 A Crim R 372, in setting individual sentences that were inappropriate to the objective seriousness of the offences before considering totality issues. 
       
       
      1. Misapplication of the guideline judgment in  
      Henry 
       
      
    27 The offences under s 97(1) (the first two offences) carry a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment. The offence under s 97(2) (the armed robbery of the security guard) carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. The guideline judgment of this Court in Henry provides a range of head sentence in respect of offences under s 97(1) between four to five years for offences characterised by the features identified in that judgment. Aggravating and mitigating factors may justify a sentence above or below the stated range, the range being intended as a starting point ([169]). 
     
      
    28 The category of case contemplated in Henry has the following features ([162]-[165]): 
     
      
       
      1. Young offender with no or little criminal history. 
       
      2. Weapon like a knife, capable of killing or inflicting serious injury. 
       
      3. Limited degree of planning. 
       
      4. Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof. 
       
      5. Victim in vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver. 
       
      6. Small amount taken. 
       
      7. Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case. 
       
      
    29 The Crown submitted that although his Honour referred to Henry and said he took it into account, his Honour appears to have paid no regard to the sentencing range to which it refers. The range of four to five years imprisonment was identified as appropriate to offences contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act where the maximum penalty is 20 years imprisonment. The offence under s 97(2) is a more serious offence and in the present case involved the use of a gun. The Crown submitted that although the Henry guideline should be acknowledged as a starting point for the offence under s 97(1), because s 97(2) provides for an aggravated form of the offence, with a higher maximum penalty, the penalty imposed by the court should be greater than the guideline may otherwise indicate: see R v Campbell [2000] NSWCCA 157 at [21]. 
     
      
    30 It was further submitted that his Honour appeared to have entirely disregarded the guideline range of four to five years in relation to the first two offences. A sentence of a fixed term of 15 months imprisonment in respect of each offence, the second being cumulative upon the first by 3 months with an effective overall sentence of only 18 months was submitted to be grossly inadequate.  
     
      
    31 With respect to the robbery of the security guard the Crown emphasised that a gun was used. It was submitted that a sentence greater than the Henry guideline was appropriate for that offence for the following reasons: 
     
      
       
      1. The offence was committed within a short time of the respondent having been granted bail in relation to the first two armed robbery offences. 
       
      2. The respondent used a gun to threaten and terrorise the victim. The gun was not merely presented but was pointed to the head of the security guard at the driver’s side window of the car in which he was seated. 
       
      3. His Honour found that the offence was planned, a finding that was demonstrated not only by the events themselves, but from evidence available from telephone intercept material. 
       
      4. The amount taken was extremely large - $29,000. 
       
      
    32 The sentence imposed was 6 years which, having regard to the 15% discount which his Honour allowed for the plea of guilty reflected a starting point of 7 years. It was submitted that the objective seriousness of this offence was considerably greater than the characteristic offence referred to in Henry and warranted a total sentence well above the range of 4 to 5 years. 
     
      
       
      2. Failure to properly assess objective seriousness and standard non-parole period as a guidepost 
       
      
    33 It was submitted that the sentencing judge failed to properly assess the objective seriousness of the aggravated car-jacking offence and the specially aggravated break, enter and steal offence, both of which carried standard non-parole periods. The first carried a standard non-parole period of 5 years and the second 7 years. The Crown was critical of the fact that his Honour identified the aggravated car-jacking offence as being “somewhere just below the mid-range.” 
     
      
    34 His Honour classified the home invasion as being “within the mid-range of offences of that type.” However, having found that it was within the mid-range his Honour did not articulate reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period. It may have been because of the early plea of guilty. The Crown submitted that given his Honour found that he could not positively conclude that the respondent is unlikely to re-offend or that he has good prospects of rehabilitation his Honour should not have departed from the standard non-parole period for this offence. 
     
      
    35 It was further submitted that the sentence which was imposed indicated that his Honour had ignored the standard non-parole period. This was said to be evident from the fact that the non-parole period imposed on the home invasion offence, four years, is just over half the standard non-parole period provided by the statute. The Crown submitted that the subjective features were not exceptional for cases of this type and did not warrant such a significant departure from the standard. The Crown also emphasised the fact that the respondent was on bail or conditional liberty in respect of all but the first two robbery offences when the offences were committed. It was submitted that this was a serious aggravating feature which his Honour had failed to adequately reflect in the sentences which he imposed (see R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [15]). 
     
      
    36 It was further submitted that his Honour erred in finding that the home invasion offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness. The offence contemplates an offender who is armed with a dangerous weapon. In the present case not only was the respondent armed with a gun but he used it to threaten the victims in a way that must have been terrifying for all concerned, especially the young man at whose head the gun was held whilst he was forced to his knees. The offence involved the taking of well over $20,000 including Euro currency and items of jewellery were also stolen. The offence was committed whilst the respondent was on bail in respect of armed robbery. Accordingly, it was submitted that the sentencing judge should have found the offence to be above the mid-range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    37 Finally, in relation to the car-jacking offence the Crown emphasised that an offensive weapon, a gun, was used to threaten both the owner of the car and the employee of the car wash. The motor vehicle was stolen and it was submitted that his Honour should have found the offence to be within the mid-range of objective seriousness and should have given serious consideration to the standard non-parole period of 5 years as a guidepost. In fact his Honour imposed a non-parole period that was only 50% of the standard period. In these circumstances it is submitted that the sentence imposed was excessively lenient. 
     
      
       
      3. Failure to comply with  
      Pearce 
       in setting individual sentences 
       
      
    38 It was submitted that although his Honour partially accumulated the sentences, the result, being a total sentence of 10 years and 9 months for five very serious offences, was excessively lenient. The non-parole period of 6 years and 9 months, even allowing for a finding of special circumstances, was submitted to be below any appropriate period of full time custody. It was submitted that the non-parole period did not appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the various offences (R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [22]). It was further submitted that having regard to both the term of the individual sentences and the overall term it would seem likely that the sentencing judge had not followed the sentencing process required by Pearce but had inappropriately considered the overall term when imposing the sentence for the individual offences. 
     
      
       
      The respondent’s submissions 
       
      
    39 In a carefully argued submission the respondent rejected the Crown’s criticism of both the individual sentences and the overall sentence. It was submitted that the sentences for the first two robberies should be seen “in the light of the history of the matter.” In this respect counsel drew attention to the fact that when deferring sentence for these matters on 28 July 2006 his Honour indicated that the appropriate sentence for a person of the respondent’s age and having regard to all other relevant factors for these offences may be “around the twelve to fifteen months on the bottom and that would be a pretty reasonable outcome. The Crown would probably say it’s a bit soft but that’s about the ball park probably, maybe up to eighteen months.” Although counsel recognised that the respondent did not take the opportunity given to him to receive counselling it was submitted that it was not appropriate for the sentencing judge to later increase the sentence beyond that which had been indicated to the respondent. It was accepted that the sentences were lenient but it was submitted that they were not so far below the guideline as to establish error. 
     
      
    40 In relation to the offence against s 97(2) it was submitted that although there was a threat of harm it was not so significant as to justify it being separately considered as an aggravating feature. The offence was “armed robbery with a dangerous weapon” and it was submitted that his Honour was correct in sentencing the respondent accordingly. It was submitted that “the sentence of 6 years reflects a starting point of 8 years before application of the discount for the plea of guilty [which] is well above the range in the guideline and is commensurate with the seriousness of the offence.” 
     
      
    41 In relation to the aggravated car-jacking offence the respondent submitted that this Court should not intervene with respect to the sentencing judge’s classification of the offence as falling “somewhere just below the mid-range” (see R v Deng [2007] NSWCCA 216; (2007) 176 A Crim R 1 at [69]). It was submitted that in the present circumstances given the discretion available to the sentencing judge the finding which he made was open. 
     
      
    42 It was submitted that by imposing a head sentence of 5 years his Honour must have had a notional starting point prior to the application of the discount for the plea of guilty of 6 years and 8 months. But for a finding of special circumstances that sentence would have carried a non-parole period of 5 years. Accordingly, it was submitted that despite his Honour’s finding that the offence was slightly below the mid-range, his Honour’s starting point was in fact a sentence with a notional non-parole period equivalent to the standard non-parole period. It was submitted that this appears to be an increment to reflect the fact that the respondent, while not on bail at the time was, in his Honour’s words “at large.”  
     
      
    43 In relation to the home invasion offence the respondent submitted that the court should not intervene with the sentencing judge’s finding that the offence fell within the mid-range. The respondent submitted that the 8 year head sentence must have had a notional starting point prior to the application of discount for the plea of guilty of 10 years, 8 months. Prior to an adjustment for special circumstances, this would have carried a non-parole period of 8 years. It was submitted that this reflected a sentence with a non-parole period of one year higher than the standard non-parole period. The respondent repeated the submission that this reflected the sentencing judge’s finding that the respondent was on bail at the time of the offence. 
     
      
    44 Given this, it was submitted that his Honour’s reasons for departing from the standard non-parole periods was quite transparent, being the plea of guilty and the finding of special circumstances. But for these matters it was submitted that the standard non-parole periods would have been applied and no error is established. 
     
      
       
      Discussion 
       
      
    45 The task faced by the sentencing judge in the present case was difficult. He was called upon to sentence a young person with no previous criminal history, but with a serious drug problem, who had committed a series of serious offences. His use of drugs and alcohol appear to have seriously compromised his thinking and at times resulted in bizarre and unpredictable behaviour. The evidence indicates that he was under the influence of illicit drugs and alcohol at the time of committing these offences. He is of low intelligence, and as the sentencing judge found, his prospects of retrieving his life from criminal activity and otherwise unacceptable behaviour were uncertain. 
     
      
    46 The crimes which the respondent committed, although varying, were all serious offences and he was required to be sentenced accordingly. They occurred during a period of a little more than 12 months and involved the use of a weapon, either a knife or a gun. They are offences which, both individually and together, indicate a preparedness to put others at risk of serious injury or to endanger their lives in pursuit of his own criminal intentions. 
     
      
    47 Although I accept the difficulty in framing appropriate sentences for each offence and providing a total sentence which is not crushing for the respondent I am satisfied that both the individual sentence and the total sentence are inadequate to such an extent that this Court must intervene. The principles which must be applied when there is a Crown appeal are set out in the well known remarks by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70] that have been repeated on many occasions. I shall not repeat them. 
     
      
    48 When sentencing the respondent his Honour paid appropriate regard to the guilty pleas, allowing a discount of 25%. His Honour was mindful of the respondent’s potential problems in rehabilitating himself. Whether a lengthy period of incarceration will bring positive results is uncertain. Although the respondent has now married and has a child, whether that relationship is capable of being re-established upon his ultimate release from prison in unknown. However, I am satisfied that the finding of special circumstances which his Honour made was appropriate. There will be an undoubted need for him to be assisted and supervised upon release if he is to become a worthwhile and law abiding member of the community.  
     
      
    49 The first two offences were both committed on 2 August 2005. Accordingly it was appropriate to provide a period of overlap of the individual sentences. In each case the respondent threatened his victim with a knife and a modest amount of money was taken. Each offence was committed in company. The respondent was aged 19 at the time. 
     
      
    50 The maximum penalty for each of these offences is twenty years imprisonment. This Court considered the range of penalties which have been imposed for similar offences in Henry. Although the court was not unanimous, its members joined in accepting that a range of sentencing information was available to underpin the adoption of appropriate guidelines for sentencing of offenders for those offences. The legitimacy of guidelines was criticised by the High Court in Wong & Leung v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 although following legislative amendment was again considered by this Court in R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252. The decision in Henry was affirmed, the Chief Justice stating that the guideline should be understood as an “indicator” and taken into account by a sentencing judge as a “check” or “sounding board.” Although in the present case the sentencing judge made reference to Henry and said he would take it into account it is difficult to understand how this has been reflected in his reasoning or in the penalties which his Honour imposed.  
     
      
    51 In proposing as a guide a sentence within the range of four to five years for the full term Spigelman CJ in Henry indicated that he had in mind a category of case with identified elements. I have referred to those elements in [28] above. 
     
      
    52 Each of these characteristics was present in the first two offences committed by the respondent. There is nothing in the circumstances of the offences or the circumstances of the respondent, and no matters were identified by his Honour, as justifying the very significant departure from the range in Henry reflected in the sentences imposed. It may be as the appellant suggests that his Honour imposed these sentences out of concern for matters of totality. If that was the case his Honour did not give any indication in his remarks that he was taking this approach. In any event, although I appreciate the circumstances of a sentencing judge with a heavy case load, the High Court’s decision in Pearce requires the appropriate sentence for each offence to first be identified before considering matters of totality ([45]). 
     
      
    53 In my judgment the serious nature of these offences required an individual sentence within the range accepted by this Court in Henry. I agree that having regard to the other offences for which he was required to be sentenced a fixed term was appropriate. That term should reflect the minimum period which the sentencing judge would have required to be served for each offence. Given that the offences occurred on the same day it is appropriate to provide a degree of overlap of the sentences. 
     
      
    54 The third offence, aggravated car-jacking, carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years but, of greater present relevance, it carries a standard non-parole period of five years. His Honour imposed a term of five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and six months. In his remarks on sentence his Honour described the offence as being “somewhere just below the mid range.” His Honour does not provide his reasons for this finding but presumably he was influenced by the fact that it was the co-offender rather than the respondent who brandished the gun. 
     
      
    55 Although this action by the co-offender justified a finding of greater criminality on his behalf I would not have been inclined to determine the respondent’s part in the offence as justifying a finding below the mid-range of objective seriousness. The relevant circumstance of aggravation was that the offence was committed in company. However, it was not irrelevant that his companion was carrying and brandishing a weapon. 
     
      
    56 It is correct as his Honour observed that the respondent pleaded guilty and was entitled to the full discount for that plea. However, a non-parole period of only 2 years and 6 months was, in my opinion, so far below the appropriate minimum term as to require intervention by this Court. There is nothing in the respondent’s subjective circumstances which would justify this sentence. It would seem likely that a “Pearce error” is responsible for the lenient sentence. 
     
      
    57 The fourth offence, robbery when armed with a dangerous weapon carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. To my mind this was a very serious offence. The respondent was on bail and used a gun which was not only produced but pointed at the head of the security guard at the driver’s side window of the car. The offence was planned and the amount taken, $29,000, was large. These matters collectively took the objective criminality significantly above that contemplated as the offence appropriate for the range in the guideline suggested in Henry. To my mind the sentence which his Honour imposed, a full term of 6 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, was inadequate. Because of the structure of the other sentences which his Honour provided the respondent would not be required to serve any penalty referable to this offence. 
     
      
    58 I have identified problems with each of the sentences for offences one to four. The sentence for the fifth offence carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 7 years. His Honour found that the offence fell within the mid-range of objective criminality – that finding was challenged by the Crown which submitted that it lies above the mid-range. 
     
      
    59 The offence to which the respondent pleaded guilty was the specially aggravated form of the offence of breaking into a house. The circumstances of special aggravation arose from the fact that the respondent was armed with a gun. However, it was the use of the gun, the holding of it to the head of the 17 year old and its discharge when the co-offender was saying “pop him” which made this offence extremely serious. The lad must have been severely traumatised as would have been the other occupants of the premises. A significant sum of cash, approximately $A25,000 and a rifle were stolen. 
     
      
    60 His Honour imposed a minimum term of 4 years with a full term of 8 years. Even allowing for the respondent’s guilty plea the sentence was sufficiently inadequate to require this Court to intervene. 
     
      
    61 The Crown submitted that when sentencing for this offence his Honour had failed to have regard to the guideline provided by this Court in R v Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435; (1999) 48 NSWLR 327. Ponfield was primarily concerned with the offence contrary to s 112(1) which carried a maximum term of 14 years imprisonment. In that case the court confined its discussion to matters relevant to a potential sentence without establishing a starting point or developing a sentencing range. With respect to the present offence the trauma suffered by the victims is of particular significance. His Honour found that impact to be substantial. That finding alone justified a sentence which reflected a finding that the offence fell above the mid-range of objective seriousness. When it is recognised that the respondent had been released on bail at the time he committed the offence a finding that the offence fell above the mid-range of objective seriousness was unavoidable. Of course, because the respondent had pleaded guilty the standard non-parole period was not directly relevant (see R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [68] but remains as a guide to the appropriate range R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 at [13]).  
     
      
    62 I have previously discussed the difficulties which have arisen in the application of Part 4 Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the disparity between standard non-parole periods and the sentences actually imposed. Those difficulties have not yet dissipated. In R v Knight & Biuvanua [2007] NSWCCA 283 I said at [5]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In many of the cases where this Court finds problems with the consideration of the standard non-parole period the sentence imposed by the primary judge differs markedly from the sentence which the relevant legislation contemplates as being appropriate, making intervention necessary notwithstanding the principles considered in  
        MD & Ors 
        . As this Court has previously acknowledged a successful Crown appeal imposes a greater burden on the offender: see  
        R v Witchard  
        [2007] NSWCCA 167 at [33]-[34]. Both this consideration, but more importantly considerations of the integrity of the sentencing process, require that sentencing judges continuously remind themselves of the principles provided by the relevant legislation and developed by this Court.” 
        
       
       
      The appropriate sentences 
       
      
    63 After consideration of the various matters to which I have referred I have concluded that this Court must intervene and impose new sentences in relation to each offence which are at the lowest end of the available range. Having identified the appropriate sentence for each offence I have adjusted the starting date to accommodate matters of totality. The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal upheld. 
       
       
      2. Sentences imposed in the District Court quashed and in lieu thereof the respondent is sentenced as follows: 
       
       
      First offence: a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 9 March 2006. 
       
       
      Second offence: a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years and 6 months commencing on 9 March 2007. 
       
       
      Third offence: fixed term of imprisonment of 5 years commencing on 9 March 2008. 
       
       
      Fourth offence: a non-parole period of 4 years with a balance of term of 3 years. The sentence to commence on 9 March 2009. 
       
       
      Fifth offence: a non-parole period of 5 years with a balance of term of 4 years. The sentence to commence on 9 March 2010. 
       
       
      The aggregate sentence is a term of 13 years. The effective non-parole period is 9 years. The respondent would be eligible for parole on 8 March 2015. 
       
      
    64 HULME J: I agree with the orders proposed by McClellan CJ at CL and, subject to the following, with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    65 Although, as his Honour correctly observes, Wood CJ at CL’s remarks in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42 at [70] have been repeated on many occasions in this Court, I do not regard those remarks as accurately stating the principles to be applied in Crown appeals. I have detailed in R v AA [2006] NSWCCA 55, reasons for that view and it is unnecessary to repeat here what I then said. It is sufficient for present purposes to observe that some of Wood CJ at CL’s remarks do not fully reflect prior authority that his Honour did not purport, and some of which he had no power, to overrule.  
     
      
    66 I accept, as I said in R v AA, that Wood CJ at CL’s remarks are a convenient summary. That summary is sufficient for most purposes and for this case. 
     
      
    67 I would add something on the topic of sentence. The effective sentence to be imposed on the Respondent is imprisonment for 13 years including a non-parole period of 9 years. The total of the 5 non-parole or fixed periods imposed for individual offences is 19 years. The very substantial reduction from this number to 9 years is justified by the combination of, (i) considerations of totality, (ii) the fact that the Respondent had no prior criminal record, (iii) his relative youth, and (iv) the fact that he would seem to have received rather less guidance and assistance from his parents than should have occurred.  
     
      
    68 Should the Respondent re-offend on his release, the second and third of the matters to which I have just referred will have no application and his punishment on this occasion should provide enough guidance to make it clear to him that society cannot tolerate the sort of conduct of which he has been convicted. While his punishment is severe, it is appreciably less so than he can expect if he offends in similar ways again. 
     
      
    69 HIDDEN J: I do not find it necessary to deal with the specific complaints made by the Crown about the sentencing judge’s approach. I agree with McClellan CJ at CL that the sentences, individually and in their combination, are manifestly inadequate and I agree with the orders which his Honour proposes.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: On 13, 14, 15, 16, 20, 21, 22 and 23 August 2007 the appellant, Dennis Arthur Bellchambers, stood his trial on a charge that on 25 May 2005 at Dunbogan he maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon Ms Julie Ann Barry with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s33. The jury returned a verdict of guilty. The trial judge sentenced the appellant to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 10 years commencing on 23 November 2007 and a balance of term of 3 years commencing on 23 November 2017. 
     
      
    2 The only ground of appeal argued was that the trial judge erred in his direction as to intoxication. For the reasons below I am of the view that the trial judge did err in his direction in this respect. Given that there was no complaint made at the trial by counsel for the appellant about the direction given a question of leave under the Criminal Appeal Rules, rule 4 arises. This, in turn, raises the operation of the proviso in the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s6(1). 
     
      
    3 Some background to the events of 25 May 2005 is necessary. The following is taken from the summary of trial prepared by the Crown and to which there was no demur by the appellant. The appellant and Ms Barry had begun some form of relationship in 2003. Both were heavy drinkers. The appellant drank scotch. Ms Barry’s drinking increased after the relationship with the appellant began. From Christmas 2003 it was noticed that Ms Barry had bruises and a black eye. Ms Barry’s daughter and son noticed bruises and wounds on their mother from time to time from 2003 to 2005. In early 2005 Ms Barry broke her collar bone. In April 2005 Ms Barry had a black eye. On one occasion she had a gash in her arm. On another a swollen face. 
     
      
    4 The appellant and Ms Barry would sometimes go to the appellant’s holiday home at Dunbogan (where the assault in question was said to have taken place). The neighbours would often hear the sound of arguments and fighting when the appellant and Ms Barry were at the Dunbogan house. 
     
      
    5 In mid-May 2005, the appellant and Ms Barry went to the Dunbogan house for a fortnight. Ms Barry would regularly go to the Dunbogan General Store to purchase alcohol, including scotch. On 22 May 2005 Ms Barry was seen by the neighbours with a black eye and a swollen face. She was seen at the general store on 23 and 24 May with a bruised and swollen eye. On 24 May, the neighbour observed that Ms Barry had two black eyes and a bruised upper right cheek. One of the neighbours had seen the appellant and Ms Barry arguing that afternoon. On the same day, 24 May, Ms Barry was seen at a liquor shop with a closed, bruised and swollen eye. She also had a bruised chest. Later in the afternoon she was seen at the local supermarket at 5pm and an employee there noticed that she had one or two black eyes and a bruised and swollen left jaw. 
     
      
    6 The relevant events of 25 May 2005 (the day of the alleged assault forming the basis of the indictment) began at about 1pm. The neighbour came home and saw Ms Barry on the verandah. She looked drunk and agitated. Her face was bruised. At about 1.40pm Ms Barry’s daughter rang the appellant’s mobile phone from Darwin. The appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        I’m sorry Sharni, she was going fucking nuts, I went whack, whack and I’ve given her two black eyes. It’s all I could do to shut her up. 
        
       
       
      He also said that Ms Barry was smashing up the house. When the appellant put Ms Barry on the phone, she was crying and somewhat incoherent. Ms Barry’s daughter then arranged for Ms Barry’s brother and sister-in-law (Mr and Mrs Howlett) to pick up Ms Barry when Mr Howlett returned from work. 
       
      
    7 Later in the afternoon, at around 3pm, a visitor to another neighbour had a conversation with Ms Barry who said that the appellant had hit her. That other neighbour later heard the appellant and Ms Barry fighting. 
     
      
    8 At about 4.30pm one of Ms Barry’s daughters rang the appellant and asked what was going on and what he was doing hitting her mother. The appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        Everything’s fine, it’s okay, you know I’ve got a broken hand, I didn’t hit her that hard 
        . 
        
       
       
        
       
      There was evidence that the appellant had injured his hand in the construction of a wooden deck at the house. Ms Barry’s daughter said that the appellant sounded affected by alcohol. Ms Barry also spoke to her daughter. The daughter said that he mother  
      “seemed a little bit pissed” 
      . 
       
      
    9 At 5.15pm one of the neighbours returned home and did not hear any fighting. 
     
      
    10 At 9.30pm Mr and Mrs Howlett arrived to collect Ms Barry. They knocked on the door for some minutes before the appellant answered. Mrs Howlett saw blood on the appellant’s shirt (on the front and the right arm). He came to the door holding a drink and a cigarette. His right hand was swollen. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        I’m glad you’re here, I’ve hit Julie. When you see her you’ll be shocked, I’m sorry I had to do it. 
        
       
       
      Mr and Mrs Howlett went to the main bedroom where they found Ms Barry lying on her back on the floor, close to the doorway. She was only wearing a t-shirt. Her face was swollen, bruised and bloody. Her eyes were swollen shut. The t-shirt and her legs had blood on them. Her breathing was wheezy and laboured. There was a spray of blood on the wall, blood on the mattress and the pillows. The fitted sheet was coated in blood and the doona was soaked in blood. Blood stained the carpet near where Ms Barry was lying. 
       
      
    11 Mrs Howlett wet a face washer to wipe some of the blood off Ms Barry. A lot of blood on her face was dry and caked. There was fresh blood near her right ear and a lot of dark blood in her mouth. There was dried blood on her upper chest, legs, hands and elbows. There were bruises over her whole body. 
     
      
    12 An exchange took place between one of the neighbours and the appellant. The neighbour said: “Mate, what the hell have you done?” The appellant replied: 
     
      
       
        
        I snapped. She drove me crazy and I snapped. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    13 Mr Howlett remembered the appellant saying in this conversation: 
     
      
       
        
        Julie hit me earlier today. … I’ve never hit another woman ever. It’s something about Julie that triggers anger in me … I’m sorry, but I had to do it … I just listened and listened for half an hour [but] hitting her was the only way I could shut her up. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    14 A conversation took place between Mrs Howlett and the appellant in which he said: 
     
      
       
        
        I don’t know what happened. I couldn’t have done that, look at my hand, everything was all right and then she just went off. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    15 The ambulance officers arrived. The appellant said to one of them that “she went crazy” and that he hit her at about 5pm. He said he hit her with his fists. 
     
      
    16 There were a number of empty scotch bottles lying around the house. No blood was noticed on any of them. 
     
      
    17 The police arrived. Det Snr Constable Buining was a forensic crime scene officer. Amongst other things he noticed was the blood splatter on the wall which appeared to have been of medium velocity and likely to have come from a wound caused by a blunt instrument. 
     
      
    18 A blood alcohol reading of Ms Barry’s blood was taken at 1.20am on 26 May at Port Macquarie Base Hospital. It gave a reading of 0.232g of alcohol per 100 ml of blood. A previous blood sample taken at 12.15am gave a reading of 0.323g per 100 ml. The variation could have been caused by the intravenous fluids or could have simply been sample variation. Dr Moynham gave evidence that if someone stopped drinking at 5pm these readings would have been equivalent to a reading at 5pm of about 0.53, a level of alcohol that might be fatal except to someone with a very high tolerance. 
     
      
    19 A neurosurgeon at Nepean Hospital (to where Ms Barry was transferred) gave evidence as to her injuries. Ms Barry had fractured ribs, multiple bruises (some recent, some not) and lacerations, a left collarbone fracture, a partially collapsed lung. There was also a superior sagittal sinus tear which required a localised and fairly severe blunt injury to the top of the head to be caused. It was unlikely to have occurred by a blow by a fist or through falling. The boggy mass of blood at the base of her skull would have taken a few hours to collect.20 On the morning of 26 May 2005 the appellant gave his version of what happened in an interview to police that was recorded and placed into evidence. I do not propose to set out verbatim all that the appellant said. The following is a sample of his explanation. 
     
      
       
        
        She was fine all the time up until a couple of days ago ... all of a sudden she just started goin’ crazy … she went over town to get some, to the co-op to get some fish for tea and everything was fine before she went and she come back and I was just sittin’ on the lounge and for some reason or other she just started beltin’ me and anyway I sort of, I didn’t hit her, I sat there and I talked to her for probably, I probably talked to her maybe three-quarters of an hour trying to calm her down and she was just going off and off and off and off … So I went to go to bed, next thing she’s ripped all the bloody, the bedclothes off and she’s into me again, beltin’ me. And I just couldn’t take it any longer. A lot of it is, like I did her, I’ll admit it, I’ll admit it, but she damaged herself as well in a tantrum. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        I only hit her twice and, ‘cause I just couldn’t handle it any longer and I couldn’t quiet her down, and I can’t believe the damage that’s got done from that bit that I hit her, ‘cause I only hit her twice. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        I just hit her in the right eye. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        And the next thing she just about crawled underneath the bed and she was just sobbin’ … I ended up goin’ to sleep … her daughter rang up … I said, look, your mother’s gone off, she’s gone crazy, and I said I didn’t want to do it, but I said, I have hit her. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Yeah, just with a fist, yeah, I broke it. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        But all the damage to her, I didn’t do that. I couldn’t believe it when I seen her face, of what it was, I couldn’t believe it, I honestly could not believe it. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        She was bloody runnin’ into the walls, the next thing she’s belted her head, that’s part of where she hit herself too. When she was goin’ off she got out of bed and belted herself on the, you know the wooden tables, them bedside tables. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        I really didn’t hit her that hard. She’s done the damage to herself, not all of it, but I would have done some, obviously, but she’s done a lot of the damage to herself. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        I had about six drinks from 3 o’clock to 5 o’clock. I was drinkin’ scotch and Coke. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        It would be a full nip or more. 
        
       
       
      (When asked whether that drinking affected him in any way the appellant answered “No”) 
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Before I went to sleep she had a black eye, but the rest of the injury she didn’t have.  
        
       
       
      (When asked on a number of occasions by the police at the interview whether he was affected by alcohol he said “No”.) 
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        I think she was just drunk, drunk and fell down the stairs, because she’s one of those people that can’t handle grog.  
        
       
       
      (On another occasion he said that she had struggled and hit her head on the little bedside table.) 
       
      
    21 The appellant did not give evidence. The electronic recorded interview and video was tendered.  
     
      
    22 The appellant’s case was that although he had hit Ms Barry twice that afternoon he did not cause the injury to her superior sagittal sinus which must have been caused by herself either in a tantrum or accidentally when affected by alcohol such as falling down the stairs or hitting her head on the wall or on the bedside table. 
     
      
    23 From the above factual background, the following can be stated, with some confidence, as matters apparent to the jury. First, the relationship between the appellant and Ms Barry was one characterised by the mutual consumption of significant amounts of alcohol and by violence. Secondly, Ms Barry suffered or was likely to have suffered a number of her injuries including the black eyes and swollen jaw before 25 May. In that regard, the stark photographs of her facial and bodily injuries that were in evidence do not necessarily reveal the damage caused to her on 25 May, being the day to which the indictment was directed. This explains why the Crown case was directed to the wound on the top of the head as the very serious injury to found the element of grievous bodily harm in the charge. Thirdly, despite the appellant’s denials to the police that he was intoxicated, the evidence of the drinking patterns of both him and Ms Barry, of the purchases of alcohol, of the observation of their affected state and the extremely high blood alcohol level of Ms Barry all point to the likelihood or at least real possibility of both the appellant and Ms Barry being significantly intoxicated during the afternoon and early evening of 25 May. 
     
      
       
      The direction 
       
      
    24 The trial judge in his summing up made clear the matters that were required to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. He also referred to the approach of the Crown, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown argues, and I will come to this in a little while, that one of the things that you can take into account in determining what the intention of the accused indeed was is what the outcome was. If I strike someone with a feather, you would not infer that I have any intention of bringing about some real harm to them. If on the other hand it is not a feather, it is a machete that I use, then you might infer from that there is an intention to cause some really significant damage to that person; and from the result you could see, so the argument runs, that must have been the intention because to believe otherwise, to not have the intention would just be contrary to your own human experience. If you deal somebody a very serious blow with a very serious object, then commonsense will tell you you must have meant to do them some real harm. That is part of the way in which the Crown argues its case. 
        
       
       
        
        But in any event, those are the elements which the Crown has to establish beyond reasonable doubt: that it was the accused who inflicted this serious injury, namely brain damage as the result of a blow to the head, the top of the head, that he did that deliberately, and that at the time he did it he had the intention that she should suffer some really serious physical harm, not necessarily the exact harm which in fact transpired. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    25 His Honour then proceeded to explain the statutory alternative and the absence of the need to prove the specific intent of intention to cause very serious physical harm: 
     
      
       
        
        It is convenient perhaps to deal now with the alternative, because as the Crown said to you in her address, and indeed as Mr Flynn dealt with in his address as well, if you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the first and second of those elements were established, namely that it was the accused who inflicted this serious physical harm on Ms Barry and that he did that deliberately, but you were not for some reason satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he had the intention of doing her real damage at the time that he inflicted the harm, then you would acquit him of the charge which it has brought, but you would then say not guilty as charged but guilty of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm; that is, perpetrated the harm deliberately but doing it without the intention to bring about such a serious, or indeed any really serious result. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    26 After discussion with counsel, the trial judge directed the jury on intoxication. The Crown had at first opposed such a direction upon the basis of what the appellant had said in his record of interview. The Crown Prosecutor, on reflection (and perfectly correctly) agreed that there should be such a direction. At the end of the afternoon of 22 August, the trial judge gave the following direction on intoxication: 
     
      
       
        
        There is one other thing that I should speak to you about this afternoon and that is the concept of intoxication. I am reminded of it by virtue of the fact that I have just been dealing with the very high blood alcohol content registered by Ms Barry. Now this charge which the Crown has brought is called in law a crime of specific intent and that is because it contains, as I have explained to you, the third element that he did this, caused a really serious harm, deliberately and that he intended to do her some really serious harm. So that is the specific intent. 
        
       
       
        
        Now if a person is intoxicated to the extent that they cannot form an intention, they are incapable of forming that sort of intention then they cannot be guilty of the crime which has the specific intent attached to it. What is the evidence of his level of intoxication and does it cause you any reasonable doubt about his ability to form the intention in this case? Well the evidence in his version to the police is that he poured himself five or six Scotches. That they were generous, bigger than a nip, although I do not think there is any further elucidation of just how big these drinks individually were. 
        
       
       
        
        So we know that he had taken, indeed the history of this pair over the preceding few weeks would tell you that each had something to drink on this day, so we know that he had had something to drink. How intoxicated was he? Well there is very little evidence of that other than his description of what he had taken. The police asked on a number of occasions and you will look at the recorded interview with this in mind as well as a number of other things. They asked him whether he was affected at various stages, whether he was affected when he was talking to them, whether he had been affected by alcohol in times earlier during the day and evening. And he said no. But you have got the way he looks to guide you as well. 
        
       
       
        
        It is a matter for you but in order to be incapable of forming the necessary intention you have got to be intoxicated to a pretty significant level but nonetheless I need to tell you that as a matter of law that if you were not satisfied that he had the capacity to form the necessary intent because of a level of intoxication based upon that evidence then you could not find him guilty because he did not have the ability to form the intention, consequently did not have the intention. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    27 The direction was as to capacity to form the specific intent. There was no direction as to the relevance or possible relevance of intoxication to whether the appellant did (as opposed to could) form the relevant specific intent. 
     
      
    28 On appeal the Crown accepted this as an error. The judge, however, returned to the topic next morning. What he said the next morning cured, so the Crown argued, any defect of the previous afternoon. The trial judge said the following to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        You will remember that I said in summary that here the Crown has charged an offence of specific intent, that is, that the accused maliciously deliberately inflicted grievous bodily harm with the intention at the time of doing that of causing grievous bodily harm. 
        
       
       
        
        Because the Crown needs to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had a particular mind set and intention, it is relevant to consider whether he had the capacity to form such an intention, and if somebody is so intoxicated they lose the capacity to form an intention, then of course they can’t have the intention. 
        
       
       
        
        So the Crown needs to negative the idea that the accused was so intoxicated that he just wasn’t able to form an intention. The Crown seeks to do that by pointing to the paucity of evidence about just how intoxicated he was. He himself says he poured five or six generous measures of scotch. I do not recall there being any detailed evidence at least over what period of time the number of drinks was consumed. In any event, the Crown says he repeats on a number of occasions during the course of his recorded interview the fact that he was not, in his own view at least, affected. 
        
       
       
        
        So the Crown says he certainly had the capacity to form the intention.  
        It remains, of course, a question of fact for you to determine whether the Crown has proven beyond reasonable doubt that he had the intention, and the Crown seeks to do that by a number of other methods which I rehearsed for you yesterday – the nature of the injuries, the circumstance, and so on. 
        
       
       
        
        That, of course, relates to an offence of specific intent. You will remember I was instructing you yesterday that there is available to you an alternative; that is, if you are satisfied of two things, namely that the accused inflicted grievous bodily harm and that he did this deliberately, non-accidentally, but you were not satisfied that he had the requisite intent that he intended that she should suffer some really serious harm at the time that he had attacked her, if I may put it in that short form, then you would come to the alternative of simply convicting him of assault inflicting grievous bodily harm without the intention. 
        
       
       
        
        Of course, if you drop the idea of the specific intention, of course the concept of intoxication by alcohol or any other means disappear. It has no longer any relevance because it is no longer an offence of specific intent. I hope I have not made that too obscure, and it leads me to put it this way to you; that when you return, assuming you have agreed upon the verdict, you will be asked this question by my associate. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    29 On appeal the Crown relied, in particular, upon the part of the direction emphasised in the above quotation. 
     
      
    30 In my view not only was the direction on intoxication given on the afternoon of 22 August flawed, but it was not cured by what was said on 23 August. 
     
      
    31 It was common ground on appeal (as it was at the trial) that intoxication was irrelevant, except as to the specific intent, that is, the intention to cause grievous bodily harm. Part 11A of the Crimes Act (ss428A-428I) deals with intoxication. Section 428B deals with specific intent, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
       428B 
         
       Offences of specific intent to which Part applies 
        
         
        (1) An  
        offence of specific intent 
         is an offence of which an intention to cause a specific result is an element. 
        (2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the offences referred to in the Table to this section are examples of offences of specific intent. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      Section 33 is one of the offences in the table under s428B. 
       
      
    32 Section 428C deals with intoxication in relation to offences of specific intent. It states: 
     
      
       
        
       428C 
         
       Intoxication in relation to offences of specific intent 
        
         
        (1) Evidence that a person was intoxicated (whether by reason of self-induced intoxication or otherwise) at the time of the relevant conduct may be taken into account in determining whether the person had the intention to cause the specific result necessary for an offence of specific intent. 
        (2) However, such evidence cannot be taken into account if the person:  
         
          
          (a) had resolved before becoming intoxicated to do the relevant conduct, or 
          (b) became intoxicated in order to strengthen his or her resolve to do the relevant conduct. 
          
         
        
       
      
    33 In Viro v The Queen (1978) 141 CLR 88 at 112, Gibbs J (as his Honour then was) said: 
     
      
       
        
        That in my respectful opinion is good sense as well as good law, and it applies equally to intoxication caused by drugs.  
         
        In a case where there is evidence fit to be considered by a jury that the accused was intoxicated as a result of the consumption of drink or drugs, it is not enough to tell the jury that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused had in fact formed the requisite special intent. They should also be told that the fact that the accused was intoxicated, whether by drink or drugs or by a combination of both, may be regarded for the purpose of ascertaining whether the special intent in fact existed. It should be explained that evidence that the accused was intoxicated will not in itself entitle him to an acquittal, because a person when intoxicated may form the necessary intent, and one who has formed the intent does not escape responsibility because his intoxication has diminished his power to resist the temptation to carry it out. However, the jury should be told that if, because of the evidence as to the effect of the intoxication or otherwise, they are not satisfied that the accused did in fact have the necessary intent, they must acquit of the crime which involves that intent.  
        
       
       
        
       
      
    34 The statement of principle, above, destroys the Crown’s argument on appeal that the further direction on 23 August cured the direction based on capacity to form the intention the afternoon before. As Gibbs J said, it is not enough to say that the Crown must prove intent, the jury should be told that the fact (if it be the case) that the accused was intoxicated may be regarded for the purpose of deciding whether the specific intent existed.  
     
      
    35 In Coleman (1990) 19 NSWLR 467; 47 A Crim R 306 at 323 and 325 Hunt J (with whom Finlay and Allen JJ agreed) reiterated what Gibbs J had said in Viro and made clear that the judge will likely fall into error by dealing with capacity to form intention, rather that the fact of intention. At 19 NSWLR 488; and 47 A Crim R 325 in a passage redolent of the circumstances here Hunt J said: 
     
      
       
        
        In the present case, it is clear from the various passages from the summing up which I have quoted or to which I have referred that the judge did on some occasions state that the issue which the jury had to decide was whether the appellant was capable of forming the various states of mind which were relevant to this charge. On other occasions the issue was correctly stated as being whether the appellant had in fact formed them. It may be that on the former occasions the judge was intending only to deal with the factual issues which arose in the case, but this unfortunately was not made clear and the jury may well have understood (or perhaps misunderstood) these directions as requiring them to decide simply whether the Crown had removed from their minds the reasonable possibility that, by reason of his intoxication, the appellant was incapable of forming the relevant states of mind. That would have been an erroneous direction. 
        
       
      
    36 Another case of some relevance here is Spencer (2003) 137 A Crim R 444. The Crown at the trial here and the judge in his summing up told the jury that they could be assisted in finding the specific intent by the seriousness of the wounds: see the extract of the summing up at [24] above. In Spencer at 451, Mildren J (with whom Bailey J and Priestley AJ agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        In the present case, there was evidence critical to the appellant's defence that the appellant was intoxicated and it would have been necessary for the jury to consider whether, in the circumstances, an inference could be drawn from the nature of the wound which caused the deceased's death, that the prosecution had proven an intent to kill or cause grievous harm, particularly as that wound was to the area of the thigh which I have previously described and required only mild force. In those circumstances, the learned trial judge was required not merely to draw to the jury's attention the evidence which bore on the extent of the appellant's intoxication, but to instruct the jury that an inference of an intent to kill or to cause grievous harm might not be as readily drawn from the nature of the injury or injuries inflicted if he were intoxicated as might be the case if he were sober and that the critical question was whether by reason of his intoxication, he might have inflicted that fatal wound without intending to kill or cause grievous harm: see R v Wingfield (1994) 156 LSJS 14 at 18; R v Williams (1999) 205 LSJS 472 at 472-473. 
        
       
       
      There was no discussion or warning by the trial judge that care was required in drawing inferences from the wound or wounds inflicted to conclude the existence of the specific intent if the jury were satisfied the accused was intoxicated. 
       
      
    37 Ultimately in argument on appeal, the Crown came close to accepting that the flaw in the direction given in the afternoon of 22 August was not cured the following morning. In my view there were two, arguably three errors. First, the clear direction as to capacity misled the jury into a false issue – the direction should have been as to whether the specific intent was held, not whether there was capacity to form it. Secondly, that was not overcome by reiterating that the Crown must prove intention. It was necessary to draw together the possibility of a lack of specific intent and intoxication. Thirdly, in particular, in the context of these errors, it was necessary to say something more about the care with which one might approach any inference about specific intent from the seriousness or nature of the injuries inflicted. 
     
      
    38 There was therefore, in my view, a misdirection. There being a misdirection it is necessary to consider whether leave should be given to permit the appellant to rely upon this matter. Leave should be given if the irregularity was of such a nature that the proviso to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act would not otherwise have been applied: Tripodina (1988) 35 A Crim R 183 at 191-195 and Coleman at 325-326. The question of rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules therefore collapses in one sense into the question whether or not the proviso applies. In argument the Crown accepted this as the essential question in the appeal. The Crown submitted that when one had regard to all the evidence a verdict of guilty was inevitable. Paragraph 39 of the Crown’s written submissions put the matter clearly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        39. Such a verdict would be inevitable having regard to all the relevant circumstances including: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          a. the repeated and very clear concessions by the Appellant that he had assaulted the victim in the bedroom at and about the relevant time; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          b. the location of the victim on the bed in that bedroom and with a pool of blood upon the mattress; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          c. (despite the continued denials by the Appellant that he had inflicted the relevant injury) the absence of any other possible means or agency by which that injury could have been inflicted upon the victim by the Appellant; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          d. the repeated and very clear assertions by the Appellant to the Police that he had not been intoxicated at the time of the assault that he was admitting; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          e. the repeated and very clear concessions by the Appellant that he had lost control at the time of the assault upon the victim that he was admitting; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          f. the tolerance of the Appellant for alcohol was obviously great and accordingly the six drinks he described having consumed could not have deprived him of the capacity to form the requisite specific intent; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          g. the inevitable inference that by whatever means he inflicted the injury, the Appellant must have done so using an object of some type, such as a liquor bottle, and with considerable force sufficient to leave the blood splatter pattern on the wall through the bed-head; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          h. the further inevitable inference that, despite any possible effects of alcohol intoxication, the Appellant must have been acting with the specific intent to inflict some really serious harm upon the victim when he caused the relevant injury to the victim. 
          
         
        
       
      
    39 Whilst there is considerable force in these submissions, ultimately, I am not persuaded that the issue of specific intent was not a legitimate one for the jury. It can be accepted that the injury to the top of the skull of Ms Barry was such that it would in all likelihood have to have been inflicted by a blunt object and in all probability one wielded by the appellant. However, if the jury were satisfied that the appellant was significantly intoxicated and if it was satisfied (as appears to have been the case) that Ms Barry was also significantly intoxicated the possibility of the wound being inflicted in a general drunken melee by a bottle or some other object in circumstances where the appellant did not specifically intend to cause the grievous bodily harm is a possibility. It was, legitimately, a question for the jury and not one which would be inevitably answered one way. This can be contrasted with the facts in Coleman where once the jury had decided as it appears to have that the accused committed the act (as the jury apparently decided the appellant did here) there could be no doubt at all that it was an act done with the specific intent. That conclusion arose from the nature and character of the act in question, being the insertion of a beer bottle with a cap still on it in the anus of the victim prior to sexual intercourse.  
     
      
    40 Here, although the medical evidence was such as to support the conclusion that the wound to the head was caused by a heavy blow which could well have been accompanied by the specific intent to cause grievous bodily harm, it was a wound that could also conceivably have occurred by the application of force in a confused drunken melee. That was, of course, not the case of the appellant in his record of interview. Nevertheless, it was a conclusion that was open to the jury in the facts that were before them being facts which were less than precise, and that were confused about both chronology and the state of intoxication of both parties, the victim, Ms Barry, and the appellant. 
     
      
    41 In all these circumstances in my opinion the proviso to s6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act does not apply and there being a misdirection of a nature which has a caused a miscarriage of justice I would grant leave to rely upon the ground of misdirection as to intoxication, allow the appeal, quash the conviction of the appellant and order that there be a new trial. 
     
      
    42 JOHNSON J: I agree. 
     
      
    43 PRICE J: I agree.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      THE COURT:  
       
      Introduction 
      
    1 This is an application under s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) for leave to appeal against the order of Mr Justice James dismissing an application to quash the first five counts in the indictment, which contains 9 counts. In his Notice of Motion the applicant also claimed an order adjourning his trial for a period of 12 months because of the intensity of the publicity that had surrounded the proceedings. His Honour dismissed the motion. He ordered that there be no publication of the application or of the proceedings on it.  
     
      
      The order prohibiting publication  
      
    2 On the hearing of the application, the Crown Prosecutor and Mr D Campbell SC, who with Ms Moisidis appeared on the applicant’s behalf, both submitted that this Court should make an order prohibiting the publication of the present application and the proceedings on it pending the conclusion of the trial. The Court made the order that the parties’ sought.  
     
      
    3 In John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd v District Court of New South Wales [2004] NSWCA 324; (2004) 61 NSWLR 344 Spigelman CJ discussed the tension between the principles of open justice and those that are concerned with securing a fair trial. The order that was the subject of appeal in that case was made by the District Court, which is not a court of general jurisdiction. However, much of the discussion was of general application. His Honour emphasised the fundamental nature of the principle of open justice to our system of justice and characterised as exceptional the occasions on which a court may order that an aspect or aspects of proceedings not be the subject of publication (at 352 [18] and 353 [21]). His Honour discussed the concern that is often expressed about the capacity of publicity to interfere with a fair trial. He said this (at 366, [103]): 
     
      
       
        
        “There are now a significant number of cases in which the issue has arisen as to whether or not an accused was able to have a fair trial in the light of substantial media publicity, indeed publicity much more sensational and sustained than anything that occurred here. Those cases have decisively rejected the previous tendency to regard jurors as exceptionally fragile and prone to prejudice. Trial judges of considerable experience have asserted, again and again, that jurors approach their task in accordance with the oath they take, that they listen to the directions that they are given and implement them. In particular that they listen to the direction that they are to determine guilt only on the evidence before them.” 
        
       
      
    4 The question of the necessity for a non-publication order should be reviewed in light of these principles. We will return to this.  
     
      
       
      Jurisdiction 
       
      
    5 The applicant was committed for trial on nine counts, six of which were for offences under s 319 of the Crimes Act of doing an act with intent to pervert the course of justice. The first five of these counts are relevant to the present application. The committal was to the District Court at Sydney.  
     
      
    6 The Chief Justice granted an exemption under s 128(2) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) (the CPA) to permit the presentation of the indictment in the Supreme Court. 
     
      
    7 Section 129 of the CPA makes provision with respect to the presentation of an indictment in the relevant court, being the Supreme Court or the District Court as the case may be, following an accused person’s committal for trial. By letter dated 9 January 2008, the Acting Manager of the Criminal Registry of the Supreme Court notified the Registrar of the District Court of New South Wales of the Chief Justice’s grant of the exemption. In a letter dated 17 January 2008, the applicant was advised that the matter was listed before the Supreme Court on 7 March 2008. 8 The Appeal Book contains a copy of an unsigned, undated indictment. (AB 60-62) The Court file does not record that the applicant has been arraigned on indictment. In these circumstances, the Court sought submissions from the parties concerning its jurisdiction to entertain an appeal under s 5F.  
     
      
    9 It appears that on 7 March 2008 the applicant appeared before Barr J, on which occasion the Crown Prosecutor presented an indictment dated 21 January 2008, signed by Mr Roser SC, Crown Prosecutor, charging the applicant in the terms that are set out in the copy indictment (AB 60-62). The applicant was not arraigned on the indictment. Mr Campbell SC, who appeared on the applicant’s behalf, informed the Court that it was proposed to “challenge a number of the counts in the indictment” (T’cpt 7/3/08 1.33-34). Justice Barr stood the proceedings over for directions before James J who was designated as the trial judge.  
     
      
    10 The proceedings came before James J on 20 March 2008 and his Honour gave directions with respect to the foreshadowed applications. The proceedings were before his Honour again on 31 March 2008. On this occasion, 28 July 2008 was fixed as the date for trial. The applicant’s attendance at court was excused on each of these occasions.  
     
      
    11 The applicant’s Notice of Motion was filed on 15 April 2008. It came on for hearing before James J on 8 May 2008. The orders claimed in the motion included:  
     
      
       
        
        “2. As to Counts 1 – 5 inclusive of the indictment:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the applicant demurs to the indictment, or alternatively 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the counts be quashed, or alternatively  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the counts be stayed as an abuse of process,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        on the grounds that they charge offences not known to the law, or alternatively on the ground that, taken at its highest, the evidence to be adduced by the Crown cannot make a prima facie case against the applicant.” 
        
       
      
    12 The Crimes Legislation Amendment (Procedure) Act 1997 (NSW) inserted s 130 into the CPA. That section relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        130 
        (1) In this section,  
        court 
          
        means the Supreme Court or District Court. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The court has jurisdiction with respect to the conduct of proceedings on indictment as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused person is arraigned, and any orders that may be made by the court for the purposes of the trial in the absence of a jury may be made before a jury is empanelled for the trial.” 
        
       
      
    13 Section 5F(1)(a) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) applies to proceedings for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court. Subsection (3) confers a right on an accused person in proceedings to which s 5F applies to appeal to this Court against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings, if the Court grants leave (or if the judge of the court of trial certifies that the judgment or order is a proper one for determination on appeal). Section 5F was introduced into the Criminal Appeal Act by the Criminal Appeal (Amendment) Act 1987, which commenced on 18 December 1987.  
     
      
    14 The Crown submitted that the Court had jurisdiction under s 5F to entertain the application for leave to appeal, since a signed indictment had been presented. Its submissions included the contention that the arraignment of an accused did not require that the accused make any indication to the court. In this respect, reference was made to the provisions of s 155 of the CPA, which deals with an accused who stands mute or will not answer directly to the indictment. This submission conflates the presentation of an indictment and arraignment. The applicant has not been arraigned on the indictment. No question of his standing mute arises.  
     
      
    15 Section 17(1) of the CPA (formerly s 362 of the Crimes Act 1900) provides that an objection to an indictment for a formal defect apparent on its face must be taken, by demurrer or motion to quash, before the jury is sworn. A demurrer admits, for the purpose of its determination, that all the statements in the count are true; and it maintains that, even admitting their truth, they are not sufficient in law to make the accused guilty of a crime and, therefore, he or she is not bound to answer them: R v Boston [1923] HCA 59; (1923) 33 CLR 386 per Isaacs and Rich JJ at 396. In Boston, counsel orally demurred on his clients’ behalf before they were required to plead to the information. In our opinion, the motion filed on the applicant’s behalf served as an effective demurrer and James J had jurisdiction to determine it.  
     
      
    16 The purpose of s 130 of the CPA is to confer power on the Court to make orders for the purposes of the trial before the jury is empanelled. To this end, it provides that the court has jurisdiction to make orders as soon as the indictment is presented and the accused person is arraigned.  
     
      
    17 Section 5F was introduced in order to confer jurisdiction on this Court to deal with appeals against the refusal to stay proceedings on indictment, which were being brought in the Court of Appeal: R v Edelsten (1989) 18 NSWLR 213. The reference in s 5F(1)(a) to the application of the section to “proceedings … for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court” is not limited to interlocutory judgments or orders made for the purposes of the trial within s 130 of the CPA. In our opinion, it includes an order such as the present, dismissing a demurrer or motion to quash an indictment. 
     
      
       
      The indictment 
      
    18 The five counts that are the subject of challenge charge the applicant that on dates between 20 October 1999 and 10 April 2004 he made a false statutory declaration with intent thereby to pervert the course of justice. The offence is provided by s 319 of the Crimes Act.  19 Section 319 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person who does any act, or makes any omission, intending in any way to pervert the course of justice, is liable to imprisonment for 14 years.” 
        
       
       
      Section 312 provides:  
       
        
        “A reference in this Part to perverting the course of justice is a reference to obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice  
        or the administration of the law 
        .” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    20 Neither the demurrer, nor the contention that each of counts 1 to 5 charged an offence not known to the law, was pressed on the hearing before James J. Mr Campbell’s submission was that the evidence that the Crown proposes to adduce is not capable of establishing a prima facie case against the applicant. 21 The issue raised by the application is whether the offence of perverting the course of justice under s 319, by reason of the inclusion of the expression “the administration of the law” in s 312, extends to conduct that is intended in any way to obstruct, prevent or defeat a government body in the exercise of its functions in applying and enforcing any of the laws of this State.  
     
      
    22 In concluding this issue against the applicant, James J considered he should treat the obiter observations of this Court in R v Subramaniam [2002] NSWCCA 372 as being highly persuasive.  
     
      
      Leave to appeal  
       
      
    23 The Crown Prosecutor opposed the grant of leave. He relied on decisions in which this Court has emphasised that it is undesirable to interrupt criminal proceedings by the bringing of applications under s 5F: R v Matovski (1989) 15 NSWLR 720; R v Waterhouse (1992) 62 A Crim R 59; Saunders v R (1994) 72 A Crim R 347; Attorney General (NSW) v Stuart (1994) 75 A Crim R 8 at 10. The principles are conveniently set out in R v Dinh [2000] NSWCCA 536 per Simpson and Howie JJ (Fitzgerald JA agreeing) at [34]. 24 In Waterhouse it was accepted that an order refusing to quash an indictment was an interlocutory order within the meaning of s 5F(1). 25 The issue raised by the application concerns the scope of the offence under s 319, and has not been previously determined. The obiter observations made in Subramaniam are attended by sufficient doubt to make it appropriate, in the interests of justice, to grant leave. 
     
      
      The proceedings before James J  
      
     26 James J summarised the evidence on which the Crown proposes to rely as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Count 1 
        
       
       
        
        On 4 September 1999 a camera-detected traffic offence was committed by the driver of a vehicle allocated to Mr Einfeld for his personal use by the Federal Court of Australia of which he was then a judge. A penalty notice for the offence was issued by the Infringement Processing Bureau.  
        
       
       
        
        On 20 October 1999 Mr Einfeld made a statutory declaration, which he sent to the Bureau, in which he asserted that at the time of the offence the vehicle was being driven by Professor N.D. Levick of Florida Atlantic University, Florida United States of America. The Crown alleges that this assertion was false; that the Professor Levick referred to in the declaration was not in Australia at the time of the offence.  
        
       
       
        
        Counts 2 and 3 
        
       
       
        
        On 4 February 2003 a camera-detected traffic offence was committed by the driver of a vehicle owned by Mr Einfeld. A penalty notice for the offence was issued by the Infringement Processing Bureau. 
        
       
       
        
        On 4 May 2003 Mr Einfeld made a statutory declaration, which he sent to the Bureau, in which he asserted that at the time of the offence the vehicle was being driven by ‘Theresa Brennan Florida Atlantic University Florida USA’ (count 2).  
        
       
       
        
        On 21 May 2003 Mr Einfeld made a further statutory declaration, which he sent to the Bureau, in which he asserted that at the time of the offence the vehicle was being driven by ‘Theresa (Prof) Brennan Florida Atlantic University Florida USA’ (count 3).  
        
       
       
        
        The Crown alleges that the assertion in each statutory declaration was false. The person referred to in each declaration, Professor Theresa Brennan of Florida Atlantic University in the United States, had died in the United States on 3 February 2003.  
        
       
       
        
        Counts 4 and 5 
        
       
       
        
        On 29 November 2003 a camera-detected traffic offence was committed by the driver of a vehicle owned by Mr Einfeld. A penalty notice for the offence was issued by the Infringement Processing Bureau.  
        
       
       
        
        On 10 February 2004 Mr Einfeld made a statutory declaration, which he sent to the Bureau, in which he asserted that at the time of the offence the vehicle was being driven by ‘Dr Tim Oliver Derbyshire England’ (count 4).  
        
       
       
        
        On 10 April 2004 Mr Einfeld made a further statutory declaration, which he sent to the Bureau, in which he asserted that at the time of the offence the vehicle was being driven by ‘Tim Oliver Hampton Court Derbyshire England’ (count 5). 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown alleges that the assertion in each statutory declaration was false. The person referred to in each declaration, Timothy Patrick Oliver, was not in Australia at the time of the offence. (Judgment, [7]-[14]).” 
        
       
      
    27 The offence charged in count 1 relates to the submission of a declaration under the Traffic Act 1909 (NSW). The Road Transport (General) Act 1999 (NSW) repealed the Traffic Act. The offences charged in counts 2, 3, 4 and 5 relate to the submission of declarations under the equivalent provision of the Road Transport (General) Act.  
     
      
    28 Under each Act, provision is made for the issue of penalty notices that provide an administrative procedure for the imposition and recovery of penalties as an alternative to court proceedings in relation to certain offences, which include camera-detected traffic control light offences and camera-recorded speeding offences: s 18A and 18B of the Traffic Act and s 43 of the Road Transport (General) Act.  
     
      
    29 The scheme under each Act is relevantly similar. The person responsible for a vehicle that is detected committing an offence may be served with a penalty notice by a police officer or other prescribed officer. The notice contains a statement of the amount of the penalty (being an amount less than the maximum amount which a court may impose in respect of the offence), to whom the sum is payable and of the recipient’s right to elect to have the matter determined by a court. If the person does not elect to have the matter determined by a court, there is no provision for the police officer or prescribed officer to elect to have the matter dealt with by the court.  
     
      
    30 A recipient of a penalty notice who does not elect to have the matter dealt with by the court is deemed to be guilty of the offence. Payment of the amount stated in the notice brings the matter to a conclusion (subject to recording the fact of the offence, and any demerit points, on the offender’s driving record).  
     
      
    31 Penalty notices are enforced under the Fines Act 1996 (NSW). The State Debt Recovery Office, a statutory body representing the Crown, is established under the Fines Act and is empowered to enter into arrangements with persons who issue penalty notices, or on whose behalf penalty notices are issued, for or with respect to the receipt, recovery and collection of amounts payable under those notices. 32 In a case in which the person responsible for the vehicle was not in charge of it at the time of the offence, he or she is required to complete a statutory declaration (a pro forma declaration is printed on the reverse side of the penalty notice) stating the name and address of the person who was in charge of the vehicle at the time of the offence. It is an offence not to provide the information within the time specified in the notice.  
     
      
    33 Section 18A(3C) of the Traffic Act and s 43(6) of the Road Transport (General) Act each make it an offence to submit a statutory declaration falsely nominating another person as the person who was in charge of the vehicle at the time the offence occurred. The offence under s 18A(3C), if relating to a vehicle registered in the name of a natural person, is subject to a maximum penalty of five penalty units (s18A(3D(b)). If the offence relates to a vehicle registered otherwise than in the name of a natural person, the maximum penalty for the offence is 10 penalty units (s 18A(3D(a)). Under s 43(6) of the Road Transport (General) Act, a similar penalty regime applies. This section provides for a penalty of 10 penalty units in the case of an offence relating to a vehicle registered in a name other than that of a natural person and a maximum of five penalty units in the case of an offence relating to a vehicle registered in the name of a natural person. 34 The declarations that the applicant signed were completed on the form that was printed on the reverse side of the penalty notice. Each contained the assertion:  
     
      
       
        
        “I make this declaration in the belief that it is true and correct and that making a false declaration is an offence and carries a penalty of up to $1000.00.” 
        
       
      
      
     
      
      Each declaration stated: 
      
      
     
      
       
        
        “This declaration must be witnessed by a Police Officer, Justice of the Peace, Barrister or Solicitor, Pharmacist, School Principal, Doctor, Bank Manager or any other person authorised to witness Statutory Declaration under the  
        Statutory Declaration Act 
         1959.” 
        
       
      
    35 Part 4 of the Oaths Act 1900 (NSW) makes provision for statutory declarations. Section 24 provides that in all cases to which Pt 4 applies the declaration (unless otherwise directed by the powers there given) shall be in the form, or to the effect of the form, in either the Eighth or the Ninth Schedule. Under s 25 it is a serious indictable offence to wilfully and corruptly make a declaration knowing it to be untrue in any material particular in any case where a declaration is authorised to be made pursuant to Pt 4. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for five years. The declaration printed on each of the penalty notices signed by the applicant is not in the form or to the effect of the form in either the Eighth or Ninth Schedule to the Oaths Act.  
     
      
    36 Under the Statutory Declaration Act 1959 (Cth), provision is made for statutory declarations to be used for the purposes of any law of the Commonwealth or of a Territory. A statutory declaration under the Commonwealth Act is to be made in the form of the Schedule to the Act. The form of the declaration printed on the reverse of the penalty notice is not in the form of the Schedule. It is unclear why reference is made in the declaration to the Commonwealth legislation.  
     
      
    37 Section 21 of the Interpretation Act 1967 (NSW) provides that a statutory declaration means a declaration made by virtue of any Act authorising a declaration to be made instead of an oath. The applicant did not submit that the form signed by him was not a statutory declaration within the meaning of s 18A(3C) of the Traffic Act or s 43(6) of the Road Transport (General) Act.  
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s first contention: inconsistency 
       
      
    38 The first way in which Mr Campbell challenged counts 1 to 5 was by contending that it was not open to prefer charges against the applicant under s 319 of the Crimes Act because, “the Traffic Acts have primacy over other laws in relation to offences that are expressly provided for within each of the Traffic Acts”. (AB 70) It was said that the applicant could have been charged in relation to the declaration that is the subject of count 1 with an offence under s 18A(3C) of the Traffic Act.  This was a summary offence in respect of which any prosecution was to be brought within six months of the date of commission: s 179 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (formerly s 56 of the Justices Act 1902). It was said that the applicant could have been prosecuted for making the declarations that are the subject of counts 2, 3, 4, and 5 for offences under s 43(6) of the Road Transport (General) Act.  This is a summary offence in respect of which any prosecution is to be brought within 12 months. 39 It was submitted that the Traffic Act and the Road Transport (General) Act do not permit proceedings for the imposition of penalties greater than those provided for under each Act. In relation to the Road Transport (General) Act, it was submitted that there exists clear inconsistency between the provisions of s 43(6) and prosecution for an offence under s 319 of the Crimes Act based on the same facts. Mr Campbell relied on s 6(2) of the Road Transport (General) Act: 
     
      
       
        
        6 General relationship with other laws 
        
       
       
        
        (1)  
        Other Acts and law not affected except as provided by this section 
        .  
         
        Nothing in the road transport legislation: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) affects any of the provisions of any other Act or any statutory rule, or takes away any powers vested in any person or body by any other Act or statutory rule, except as provided by this section, or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) affects any liability of any person at common law except to the extent that the road transport legislation provides otherwise expressly or by necessary intendment. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2)  
        This Act generally prevails over other legislation in cases of inconsistency 
         
        However (subject to subsection (3)): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) an Act that forms part of the road transport legislation prevails over any other Act or statutory rule to the extent of any inconsistency, and 
           
           
          (b) a statutory rule that forms part of the road transport legislation prevails over any other Act or statutory rule to the extent of any inconsistency in respect of driver licensing, vehicle registration or traffic on roads or road related areas (or other related matters). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3)  
        Regulations may displace operation of subsection (2) 
         
        Despite subsection (2), the regulations may provide that any other Act or a statutory rule (or any provision of another Act or statutory rule) prevails over an inconsistent provision of the road transport legislation.  
         
        
       
      
    40 James J rejected the applicant’s submissions as to inconsistency by reference to the provisions of s 43(10) of the Road Transport (General) Act and s 17 and s 18B(8) of the Traffic Act. These provisions are set out below:41 Section 43(10) of the Road Transport (General) Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(10)  
        Section does not derogate from any other law 
         
        The provisions of this section are in addition to and not in derogation of any other provisions of this or any other Act.” 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    42 Section 17 of the Traffic Act relevantly provided:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        17 Common Law or statute liability 
         
        (1) Nothing in this Act shall affect any liability of any person by virtue of any statute or at common law”. 
        
       
      
    Section 18A(6) provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “The provisions of this section shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any other provisions of this or any other Act”.  
         
        
       
       
      Subsection 18B(8) provided: 
       
       
        
        “The provisions of this section are supplemental to and not in derogation of the provisions of any other section of this Act or any other Act in relation to proceedings which may be taken in respect of prescribed offences”. 
        
       
      
    43 In our opinion, his Honour was correct to hold that s 17 and s 18B(8) of the Traffic Act and s 43(10) of the Road Transport (General) Act operate such that the Crown is not precluded from prosecuting the applicant for an offence under s 319 of the Crimes Act by reason of asserted inconsistency with either of the traffic Acts.  
     
      
    44 Mr Campbell’s submission was put more generally on the basis that, “[a]s a general proposition the Crown should not resort to prosecuting for the serious general offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice where the legislature has provided special minor offences for the same conduct”. (AB 69) We consider that his Honour was also correct to reject this submission. Conduct may give rise to offences under provisions of the one Act or different Acts and the choice of whether to charge an offence of greater or lesser severity involves an exercise of prosecutorial discretion. It is not an abuse of the process of the court to prosecute for the more serious offence (unless the decision was made mala fides, which is not suggested here).  
     
      
    45 In Environment Protection Authority v Australian Iron & Steel Pty Ltd (1992) 28 NSWLR 502 Gleeson CJ said this (at 507): 
     
      
       
        
        “Where an Act of Parliament makes a certain type of conduct an offence, and imposes a penalty, the offence will usually be characterised in terms of a certain quality or attribute that may be attached to primary facts. Different statutes may fasten upon different qualities or attributes of the same set of primary facts to create separate offences. To assert that a person may not be convicted of multiple offences for the same facts invites a request for a more precise definition of the relevant facts.” 
        
       
      
    46 In Maroney v R [2003] HCA 63; 216 CLR 31 Gleeson CJ said at 36, [12]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[12] Further, the validity of the Crown's construction is not negated by the fact that the appellant may have received a lesser sentence if the charge had been one of possession rather than supply. (The contention that the appellant would have been given a lesser sentence depends on several highly questionable assumptions about whether or not he would have been tried summarily and what the approach of the sentencing judge would have been if he had, but it is not necessary to debate their validity.) It is common for criminal offences to overlap and for very different sentencing outcomes to be possible within the area of overlap depending on how the Crown chooses to proceed. These differences are not, at least in the present statutory context, determinative of any particular construction. So far as the appellant suggested that the Crown approach had operated harshly against him, or that the Crown construction operated so severely as to indicate that it was flawed in some way, the suggestion must be rejected. It was probable that Parliament perceived the introduction of drugs into prisons as something that called for wide-ranging prohibitions and serious punishments. That perception supports the Crown construction rather than negating it.” 
        
       
      
    47 In the course of the hearing, Mr Campbell acknowledged that had the declarations subscribed by the applicant been in accordance with Pt 4 of the Oaths Act, he might have been liable to prosecution for the offence under s 25 of that Act, notwithstanding the provision of the lesser offence in the Traffic Act and the Motor Transport (General) Act. (T’cpt 18.3-6) This concession was rightly made and must apply to prosecution for an offence under the Crimes Act.  
     
      
       
      The scope of the offence created by s 319 of the  
      Crimes Act 
        
       
      
    48 Before James J, and on the application, Mr Campbell’s principal contention was that the words “the administration of the law” in s 312 are to be understood in their context, which is that Pt 7 of the Crimes Act is concerned with “public justice” offences. An essential aspect of such offences was said to be their potential to affect the course of curial proceedings. In this respect, it was submitted that they are to be distinguished from offences arising out of conduct directed to the avoidance of a penalty or other liability which are not recovered by proceedings in a court or tribunal. Mr Campbell attached copies of a large number of Acts and regulations which contain provisions making it a summary offence punishable by fine to supply false information to a public official or statutory corporation: s 11 of the Annual Holidays Act 1944; s 10 of the Bio Fuel (Ethanol Content) Act 2007; s 35 of the Boxing and Wrestling Control Act et cetera. In his submission, to give the words “the administration of the law” in s 312 their literal grammatical meaning would produce an absurd result, criminalising as a perversion of the course of justice conduct that hitherto has constituted, at most, a minor summary offence.49 The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the Parliament was to be understood as intending that the general offence of perverting the course of justice under s 319 have a wider area of operation than the common law offences of perverting or attempting or conspiring to pervert the course of justice that it replaced. In his submission, the words of s 312 are unambiguous and operate such that an act done with the intention (or an omission made with the intention) of obstructing, preventing or defeating the administrative acts of government in the enforcement of the laws of the State is a perversion of the course of justice.  
     
      
    50 The traffic legislation creates a number of criminal offences, which range in seriousness. There exists a wholly administrative mechanism for imposing and recovering penalties for designated offences. In the Crown’s submission, to characterise the intentional subversion of the scheme by the submission of a false declaration in order to avoid liability as perverting the course of justice is neither an irrational nor absurd result. 
     
      
       
      James J’s reasons  
      
    51 His Honour approached the matter on the basis that the words “the course of justice” in the first part of the definition are to be given their meaning at common law as explained in R v Rogerson [1992] HCA 25; (1991-1992) 174 CLR 268.  
     
      
    52 In Rogerson, Brennan and Toohey JJ (who formed part of the majority) explained the concept in this way (at 280): 
     
      
       
        
        “The course of justice consists in the due exercise by a court or competent judicial authority of its jurisdiction to enforce, adjust or declare the rights and liabilities of persons subject to the law in accordance with the law and the actual circumstances of the case. The course of justice is perverted (or obstructed) by impairing (or preventing the exercise of) the capacity of a court or competent judicial authority to do justice. The ways in which a court or competent judicial authority may be impaired in (or prevented from exercising) its capacity to do justice are various. Those ways comprehend, in our opinion, erosion of the integrity of the court or competent judicial authority, hindering of access to it, deflecting applications that would be made to it, denying it knowledge of the relevant law or of the true circumstances of the case, and impeding the free exercise of its jurisdiction and powers including the powers of executing its decisions.” 
        
       
       
      Mason CJ said (at 276): 
       
       
        
        “The course of justice relevantly includes the proceedings of judicial tribunals, that is, tribunals having authority to determine the rights and obligations of parties and having a duty to act judicially. 
         
         
        It has been suggested that ‘the course of justice’ and ‘the administration of justice’ include police investigations as such. True it is that some judicial comments are capable of being understood as lending support to that bald proposition. These comments have been made for the most part in cases in which a person has been convicted of an attempt to pervert the course of justice by misleading police in their investigation of a crime or suspected crime. 
        
       
       
        
         
        But police investigations do not themselves form part of the course of justice. The course of justice begins with the filing or issue of process invoking the jurisdiction of a court or judicial tribunal or the taking of a step that marks the commencement of criminal proceedings.” 
         
        
       
      
    53 James J held that, taken at its highest, the evidence that is proposed to be adduced by the Crown would be incapable of satisfying a jury beyond reasonable doubt on any of counts 1 to 5 that the applicant intended, by making the statutory declaration, to pervert the course of justice in the sense explained in Rogerson (judgment [127]).  
     
      
    54 His Honour continued:  
     
      
       
        
        “[128] … A course of justice consists in the due exercise by a Court of its jurisdiction. An offence of perverting the course of justice can be committed, even though no court proceedings have been commenced. However, if no court proceedings have been commenced, it is necessary that the offender should have contemplated court proceedings. It can be sufficient that the offender contemplated merely the possibility that court proceedings might be instituted and it is not necessary that anyone other than the offender should have contemplated the possibility of court proceedings.  
        
       
       
        
        If the offender contemplates the possibility of court proceedings being instituted, then the course of justice can be perverted in any of the various ways set out in the joint judgment, by the offender doing an act with the intention of perverting the course of justice.  
        
       
       
        
         
        [129] In the present case it was submitted by the Crown that the mere issue of a penalty notice commenced a course of justice. I am unable to accept this submission. The issue of a penalty notice by the Infringement Processing Bureau is not equivalent to the commencement of proceedings in a court or a judicial authority or the invoking of the jurisdiction of a court or a judicial authority.  
        
       
       
        
        [130] If, in the case of any penalty notice, Mr Einfeld, after being issued with the penalty notice, had taken the option of electing to have the matter dealt with by a court, then the evidence would have been capable of establishing that Mr Einfeld contemplated the possibility of court proceedings and of establishing that his act was done with the intention of perverting the course of justice in those court proceedings. However, Mr Einfeld did not, in the case of any penalty notice relevant to any of counts 1 to 5, take the option of electing to have the matter dealt with by a court.  
        
       
       
        
        [131] In each case, the option taken by Mr Einfeld was to make a statutory declaration nominating another person as having been the person in charge of the vehicle at the time of the offence. In my opinion, Mr Einfeld having taken this option, the evidence in the Crown brief would be incapable of satisfying a jury beyond reasonable doubt that at the time of making the statutory declaration Mr Einfeld contemplated the possibility of court proceedings and intended by making the statutory declaration to pervert the course of justice in such court proceedings.  
        
       
       
        
        [132] It is true that each penalty notice warned Mr Einfeld that, if the notice was not finalised by the due date, that is if Mr Einfeld did not comply with the notice by the due date by taking one of the options offered, ‘further action’ or ‘further enforcement action’ would be taken. However, none of the notices by its terms threatened Mr Einfeld with prosecution, if he did not finalise the notice by the due date. This is to be contrasted with the statement in each notice that, if a person other than Mr Einfeld had been driving the vehicle at the time of the offence, a failure by Mr Einfeld to make a statutory declaration nominating that other person as having been the driver would be an offence for which Mr Einfeld might be prosecuted.  
        
       
       
        
        [133] The procedures for enforcing a penalty notice which has not been complied with, such as a penalty notice under the  
        Traffic Act 
         or the  
        Road Transport (General)  
        Act, are set out in Pt 3 of the  
        Fines Act 
         1996. These procedures are almost entirely administrative and include the issue of a penalty reminder notice (Div 3) and the making of a penalty notice enforcement order by the State Debt Recovery Office, which may be made in the absence of and without notice to the person concerned, that is without any court proceedings (Div 4).  
        
       
       
        
        [134] At some points in the generally administrative system of the  
        Fines Act 
         an application to a court is possible, for example if a person wishes to appeal against a refusal by the State Debt Recovery Office to annul a penalty notice enforcement order. However, there is no evidence in the Crown brief capable of satisfying a jury beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Einfeld intended at the time of making a statutory declaration to pervert the course of justice in such distant and hypothetical court proceedings.  
        
       
       
        
        [135] The Crown pointed to s 18A(4) of the  
        Traffic Act 
         and s 43(8) of the  
        Road Transport (General) Act 
        , by virtue of which a statutory declaration made by Mr Einfeld would be evidence in proceedings brought against the person named in the declaration that that person was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the offence.  
        
       
       
        
        [136] However, all of the persons named by Mr Einfeld were stated by Mr Einfeld in his statutory declarations to be living overseas, with no precise address being given, and one of them (Professor Brennan) was, on the Crown case, known by Mr Einfeld to be dead. In my opinion, the only reasonable inference a jury could draw would be that Mr Einfeld in making each statutory declaration nominated a person who he said was living overseas (one of whom was in fact dead), in the belief that no action would ever be taken by the New South Wales authorities to pursue the person he named. Even if any action was taken, it would merely take the form, as the penalty notice indicated, of a fresh penalty notice being issued to the person named by Mr Einfeld. In my opinion, the evidence in the Crown case would be incapable of satisfying a jury beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Einfeld intended by making the statutory declaration to pervert the course of justice in court proceedings which he contemplated would be brought against the person named by him in the statutory declaration.” 
        
       
      
    55 On the hearing of the application, the Crown Prosecutor did not submit that his Honour’s finding that the applicant’s conduct was not in law capable of amounting to a perversion of the course of justice in the way that expression was explained in Rogerson, was wrong.  
     
      
    56 Sections 319 and 312 were enacted by the Crimes (Public Justice) Amendment Act 1990, which inserted Part 7 into the Crimes Act (the Public Justice Amendment). James J accepted the Crown’s submission that the Attorney-General’s speech when the Bill for the Public Justice Amendment was read a second time in the Legislative Assembly made clear that the offence in s 319 was not intended simply to reproduce the common law (at [140]). His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “[141] I consider that the words “the administration of the law” having been included in the definition in s 312, they have to be given some effect beyond the effect to be given to words “the course of justice”. 
        
       
       
        
        [142] On a literal interpretation, the expression “the administration of the law” is apt to include the exercise by a government body of its functions in applying and enforcing the law of this State. See the definition of “administration” in the Macquarie dictionary (2nd ed).  
        
       
       
        
        [143] No suggestion was made in the argument on the application about how the literal meaning of the expression could be confined, apart from a suggestion that an act perverting the administration of the law should be confined to an act having the potential to affect the course of justice in court proceedings. However, if this suggestion was adopted, the expression “the administration of the law” would add little, if anything, to the expression “the course of justice” as explained in  
        Rogerson” 
        . 
        
       
      
     57 It is convenient at this juncture to refer to the decision of this Court in Subramaniam. The appellant in that case was employed by Ms Johnson, who was the owner of a vehicle that was detected committing a camera-recorded traffic control light offence. On receipt of the penalty notice, Ms Johnson elected to have the offence dealt with by a court. After Ms Johnson made that election, the appellant signed a statutory declaration stating that she had been the driver of the vehicle at the time of the offence. It was the Crown case that the appellant’s assertion in the declaration that she was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the offence was false. The appellant was charged with two offences under s 319. The offence charged in count 1 was based on the making of the false declaration. The offence charged in count 2 related to evidence given by the appellant in the District Court. The trial proceeded as a special hearing under s 19 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (NSW). The jury returned verdicts that, on the limited evidence available, the appellant had committed the offence charged in count 1 and that she was not guilty of the offence charged in count 2.  
     
      
    58 On appeal, a number of grounds were relied on including that the verdicts were inconsistent. One ground contended that the verdict on count 1 was unsafe in that the facts relied on by the Crown were not capable of proving the elements of the s 319 offence: the appellant’s conduct in swearing the statutory declaration had been directed to the Infringement Processing Bureau and not to the Court. Beazley JA (with whose judgment on this point Sully and Simpson JJ agreed) discussed the elements of the offence in light of the definition in s 312. The decision was overturned in the High Court, but on a point that does not concern the reasoning in this respect. Her Honour said this:  
     
      
       
        
        [58] In my opinion, the appellant's submission founders at a factual level. Whilst Ms Johnson did send a copy of the statutory declaration to the infringement processing bureau, curial proceedings by that stage had already been instituted pursuant to Ms Johnson's election made on 8 September. The statutory declaration was provided to the court on 24 April 1996, when Mr Sukkar attended before the Registrar and made an application to have the matter re-listed on a date other than that which had been nominated by the court. It would seem that the forwarding of the statutory declaration to the bureau might best be viewed as a 'back up' measure. 
         
         
        [59] In any event, s 312 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         provides that a reference to ""perverting the course of justice"" includes a reference to ""obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating ... the administration of the law"". In my opinion, it is not necessary for the indictment to include the definitional provision in s312. It is sufficient for a person to be charged in terms of s319. Accordingly, even if the statutory declaration was made for the purpose of sending to the Infringement Processing Bureau, the evidence supported the commission of the offence. 
         
         
        [60] Counsel for the appellant in this part of his submissions then drew attention to the fact that the trial judge did not give a direction so as to cover the extended definition. It would of course only have been necessary to have done so if the case was conducted on the basis that the notice was one directed to the Bureau and not to the court. As I have indicated, the evidence is against that. There is a further problem with the appellant's submission in this regard, namely, that no direction was sought by counsel at the trial that there be a direction of the type now suggested. Given the factual circumstances, where the statutory declaration was made after the court proceedings were commenced and where the declaration was given to the court, I would not grant leave to the appellant to now raise this matter.” 
        
       
      
    59 James J considered that her Honour’s judgment supported the view that the sending of a false statutory declaration to the Infringement Processing Bureau about the identity of the driver of a vehicle at the time of an offence is capable of amounting to an offence under s 319 of perverting the course of justice by perverting “the application (sic: the administration) of the law” (at [155]). As noted, his Honour considered that he should treat Subramaniam as being highly persuasive. He concluded that “the making and sending of each statutory declaration to the Infringement Processing Bureau would be capable of amounting to perverting the course of justice in the sense of perverting the administration of the law” (at [157]).  
     
      
      The scope of the offence created by s 319 
      
    60 Mr Campbell submitted that his Honour erred in holding that there were two limbs to the offence under s 319. He submitted that the Attorney-General’s second reading speech did not support the assertion that the Parliament had intended, in enacting the Public Justice Amendment, to introduce an offence of perverting the administration of the law.  
     
      
    61 The Crown Prosecutor submitted that it was apparent by reference to the Attorney-General’s second reading speech that the offence provided for by s 319 was not intended to simply reproduce the common law. If this had been the Parliament’s intention it was said that, “it would not have been necessary for section 312 … to have been enacted at all but to rely upon the settled common law definition of what was ‘perverting the course of justice’”. (WS [138]) 62 The Crown Prosecutor also referred to the Explanatory Note to the Bill for the Public Justice Amendment. Both are set out below. Relevantly, the Attorney-General said (Legislative Assembly, 17 May 1990, Hansard at 3692): 
     
      
       
        
        “At present there is no comprehensive statement of the law relating to public justice offences. The law is fragmented and confusing, consisting of various common law and statutory provisions, with many gaps, anomalies and uncertainties. Common law offences have no specific penalty provided and the exact limits of these offences are sometimes difficult to establish. The bill will rectify this by creating specific offences dealing with a number of areas … A general offence of perverting the course of justice is also included … It has been necessary to include this offence as, no doubt, offenders will find particularly devious ways of perverting the course of justice that are not covered by any of the specific offences in the bill. It is intended that this offence will cover such situations.” 
        
       
      
    63 The Explanatory Note to the Bill for the Public Justice Amendment stated: 
     
      
       
        
        ‘The object of this Bill is to amend the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 to replace Parts 7 (Perjury and like offences) and 8 (Conspiracy to accuse of crime) of that Act with a new Part (Public justice offences) that deals with offences in the following areas: 
        
       
      
    · interference with the administration of justice· interference with judicial officers, witnesses, jurors etc.· perjury, false statements etc.  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          The proposed new Part will also abolish common law offences made redundant by the new statutory offences or which are now obsolete.  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          The Bill also makes consequential amendments to other Acts.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
         
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Proposed section 312 defines what is meant by ‘ 
        perverting the course of justice 
        ’.  
        
       
       
        
        …  
        
       
       
        
        Proposed section 319 creates the general offence of perverting the course of justice (maximum penalty 14 years’ penal servitude). This offence will apply to conduct not dealt with specifically by another provision of the proposed Chapter.” 
        
       
      
    64 The issue is one of statutory construction. The general approach is explained in Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority [1998] HCA 28; 194 CLR 355 per McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ at 381 [69]. The primary object is to construe the provision so that it is consistent with the language and purpose of all the provisions of the statute. In ascertaining the purpose of the Public Justice Amendment the Court may have regard to the Minister’s speech and the Explanatory Note: s 34 of the Interpretation Act 1987 (NSW). However, as Spigelman CJ explained in Harrison v Melham [2008] NSWCA 67 [12]-[16] (see also Mason P at [159]-[173]), the task is directed to the objective intention of Parliament and not the subjective intention of the Minister. 
     
      
    65 Part 7 codified a part of the common law dealing with offences relating to the integrity of curial proceedings and criminal justice. It effected the abolition of a collection of poorly defined common law offences, which included perverting the course of justice and attempting or conspiring to pervert the course of justice. Among the common law offences that were abolished was the offence of “persuading a person to make a false statement to police to mislead them in their investigation”. The existence and scope of such an offence remained a matter of controversy at the date of its abolition, as the history set out in McHugh J’s judgment in Rogerson (at 299 – 303) makes clear. Another common law offence that was abolished was described as the offence of “dissuading, intimidating or preventing, or attempting to dissuade, intimidate or prevent, a person who is bound to give evidence in a criminal matter from doing so”. The offence is described, for the purposes of its abolition, as having as an element that the person who is dissuaded was “bound” to give evidence. This was the issue in R v Carroll [1913] VLR 380, in which the appellant’s conviction for the offence was affirmed, notwithstanding that the person whom he dissuaded was not bound over to give evidence. Cussen J held that all attempts to interfere with the course of justice are criminal contempts and that if there was an attempt to influence the due course of justice it was punishable by the criminal law (at 383). The point to be made is that, at the date of the Public Justice Amendment, the law in this area was confused and that one purpose in codifying it was to make it certain. 66 Part 7 introduced offences, many dealing with conduct that at common law constituted perverting or attempting to pervert the course of justice: tampering with evidence (s 317, maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years); corruption of witnesses and jurors (s 321, maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years); threatening or intimidating judges, witnesses, jurors and others (s 322, maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years); influencing witnesses and jurors (s 323, maximum penalty: imprisonment for 7 years); preventing, obstructing or dissuading a witness or juror from attending (s 325, maximum penalty: imprisonment for 5 years); reprisals against judges, witnesses, jurors and others (s 326, maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years). The maximum penalties for the offences in ss 321, 322 and 323 are imprisonment for 14 years in a case in which the offence was committed with the intention of procuring the conviction or acquittal of a person of any serious indictable offence (s 324).  
     
      
    67 Part 7 introduced offences that are concerned with criminal investigation. It is an offence to make an accusation intending a person to be the subject of investigation of an offence, knowing that person to be innocent of the offence (s 314, maximum penalty: imprisonment for 7 years). It is an offence to do anything intending to hinder the investigation of a serious indictable offence committed by another person, or the discovery of evidence concerning a serious indictable offence committed by another person or the apprehension of another person who has committed a serious indictable offence (s 315, maximum penalty: imprisonment for 7 years). It is offence to fail without reasonable excuse to bring information material to securing the apprehension or conviction of an offender who is known or believed to have committed a serious indictable offence (s 316(1), maximum penalty: imprisonment for 2 years). 68 Part 7 also provided a general offence of perverting the course of justice. This offence is punishable by a maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment, and is one of the most serious of the public justice offences. No offence of obstructing or hindering a public official in the exercise of his or her official duty, or the like, was provided under Pt 7.  
     
      
    69 We do not draw from the Attorney General’s speech or the Explanatory Note that the Parliament is to be understood as having intended that the statutory offence of perverting the course of justice would extend to cover conduct involving the intentional obstruction, prevention or defeat in any way of the functions of a government body applying and enforcing the law of the State. This does not mean that s 319, when read with s 312, does not create such an offence. It is only to say that we do not discern support for the Crown’s submission as to the interpretation of s 319 and s 312 from the extrinsic material.  
     
      
    70 The Crown submitted that the elements of the offence are (WS [60] and [61]): 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The accused did any act or made any omission; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) With intent in any way to pervert the course of justice.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Perverting the course of justice includes: 
        
       
       
        
        (c) Obstructing, Preventing; or Defeating; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) The course of justice or the administration of the law. 
         
          
        
       
      
    71 The gravamen of the offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice at common law was described in R v Vreones [1891] 1 QB 360 per Pollock B at 369: 
     
      
       
        
        “The real offence here is the doing of some act which has a tendency and is intended to pervert the administration of public justice.” 
        
       
      
    72 The Crown’s submission is that the statutory offence under s 319 does not require proof that the conduct possessed the tendency to pervert the course of justice. In R v Charles, Court of Criminal Appeal (unreported) 23 March 1998, the appellant was convicted of an offence under s 319, involving the purported perversion of the course of justice, being the proceedings before a coroner conducting an inquest into a death. The appellant was alleged to have approached a woman, Mrs Marshall, whom he believed to be a witness at the inquest, with the request that she tell the police, falsely, that she had only met him on one occasion. The appellant’s conviction on this count was quashed on appeal. Each of the members of the Court assumed that proof of the tendency to pervert the course of justice was an element of the offence: Gleeson CJ at 5; James J at 20 and Barr J at 27. The summing-up was deficient in that it failed to direct attention to the respects in which it was suggested that the false account that the appellant had met Mrs Marshall only once could have obstructed the course of justice at the inquest: Gleeson CJ at 5; Barr J at 26. 73 In R v Karageorge (1998) 103 A Crim R 157, the question of whether it was necessary to establish that the act or omission possessed the tendency to pervert the course of justice was touched upon, although it was unnecessary for this to be decided. Sully J expressed his agreement with the following statements of principle in P Gillies, Criminal Law (3rd ed, 1993), pp 820-821: 
     
      
       
        
        ““The statutory offences of this type refer to the perverting of the course of justice or ‘the (due) administration of the law’. Does the latter expression exclude the holding in  
        Rogerson 
        , that police investigations, or other administrative processes occurring prior to the vesting of the court’s jurisdiction in the subject matter, are not per se part of the ‘course of justice’ for the purposes of liability for the common law offence? The phrase would do this, conceivably, if it added to the scope of ‘course of justice’ and thus extended the scope of the statutory offence in a relevant way. In  
        Rogerson, 
         Mason CJ made the obiter comment that ‘the courts of justice’ and ‘the administration of justice’ are synonymous in their meaning – and that neither includes police investigations, in that the police do not ‘administer justice’. The expression ‘administration of the law’ (in the statutory provisions) is arguably broader in its scope, although the matter awaits judicial determination.  
        
       
       
        
        The New South Wales provision ( 
        Crimes Act 
         1900, s 319) refers to the offence there created as being one involving conduct intended ‘in any way to pervert the course of justice’. The expression, ‘pervert the course of justice’, it has been seen, is defined in s 312 (for the purposes, inter alia, of s 319) as referring to ‘obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice’. The offence then, is clearly broad in scope. It does not in its literal terms require the intentional doing of an act which actually perverts justice, or one having this tendency. Rather, it requires simply that the conduct of the accused be accompanied by the intent to pervert justice. It therefore embraces (as does the common law offence) acts which fall short of actually perverting justice, and which merely have this potential. Indeed, the actus reus of the statutory offence is apparently even broader than the common law offence – any act intended by D to pervert justice will suffice, even if it does not on an objective view either pervert the course of justice, or even have the tendency to pervert justice (because of, say, D’s miscalculations in the matter).” 
        
       
       
      His Honour’s endorsement of this statement was in a context in which he considered that, in the circumstances of that case, there was no question as to the capacity of the conduct to have the requisite tendency. Levine J noted that in  
      Charles 
       it had been assumed that the s 319 offence required proof that the act had the tendency. His Honour refrained from deciding the issue (at 173).  
       
      
    74 In R v Giovannone [2002] NSWCCA 323, the appellant was convicted of an offence contrary to s 319. It was the Crown case that he had asked a police officer to provide protection for a man named Rocky, who was dealing in illegal drugs in Kings Cross. One of the contentions advanced on appeal was that the s 319 count was bad in law in that it did not aver facts constituting an offence (at [30]). Mason P (with whose judgment on this point Hidden J and Carruthers AJ agreed) held that the count was good. His Honour observed that the requested assistance: 
     
      
       
        
        “[32] … fell clearly on the right side (for the Crown) of the distinction drawn by the High Court in  
        R v Rogerson 
         between interference with police investigations which are not themselves part of the course of justice and conduct which had a tendency to deflect the police from prosecuting an offence, which do. … The trial was fought on this issue. This constituted an attempted interference in the curial jurisdiction that the police would invoke if Rocky were arrested (cf  
        Rogerson 
          
        at 277, 284, 294-295, 304-305, 311). Merely because the defence case sought to put a different, benign interpretation on the request for police ‘ 
        protection 
        ’ did not render the charge bad in law. Nor does the fact that the charge sought to summarise the nub of the request rather than quoting specific passages of the conversation in direct speech. 
        
       
       
        
        [33] It therefore becomes unnecessary to consider the Crown's alternative submission (on appeal) that the conduct established in relation to the second count satisfied the latter part of s 312 of the  
        Crimes Act 
        . That section provides (emphasis added): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘A reference in the Part to perverting the course of justice is a reference to obstructing, preventing, perverting or defeating the course of justice or the  
          administration of the law 
          .’  
          
         
         
        The events giving rise to the charges in  
        Rogerson 
         clearly predated whatever change to the common law was effected by s 312 when it was enacted in 1990. Its scope remains to be determined (see  
        R v Karageorge 
         (1998) 103 A Crim R 157). One difficulty with the Crown's invocation of s312 is the very form of the indictment, which in its first two counts, pleaded conduct with intent to pervert ‘ 
        the course of justice 
        ’. The indictment does not refer to ‘ 
        the administration of the law 
        ’. 
        
       
       
        
        [34] The trial judge told the jury that an act which constitutes a perversion of the course of justice is one which is an adverse interference with the proper administration of criminal justice (SU 12). I do not read this as invoking the latter part of s 312.” 
        
       
      
    75 Argument on the appeal did not address the question of whether the requirement of proof of the tendency to pervert the course of justice forms part of the statutory offence. It may be that, as the Crown submitted, it does not. This would point to the correctness of the Crown’s submission, that s 319 is not to be understood as simply restating the common law. It would also underline the protean nature of the offence if the definition is given its literal meaning.  
     
      
    76 In Saraswati v R (1990-1991) 172 CLR 1, McHugh J, in the course of discussing the construction of s 61E(2) of the Crimes Act, observed that (at 21): 
     
      
       
        
        “In many cases, the grammatical or literal meaning of a statutory provision will give effect to the purpose of the legislation. Consequently, it will constitute the ‘ordinary meaning’ to be applied. If, however, the literal or grammatical meaning of a provision does not give effect to that purpose, that meaning cannot be regarded as ‘the ordinary meaning’ and cannot prevail. It must give way to the construction which will promote the underlying purpose or object of an Act:  
        Interpretation Act 
        , s 33”. 
        
       
       
      His Honour went on to refer to the judgment of Mason and Wilson JJ in  
      Cooper Brookes (Wollongong) Pty Ltd v Federal Commissioner of Taxation 
       [1981] HCA 26; (1981) 147 CLR 297 at 321. He continued (at 22): 
       
       
        
        “Furthermore, if the “ordinary meaning” of a legislative provision is manifestly absurd or unreasonable, a real doubt must arise as to whether Parliament intended the enactment to have its ordinary meaning: cf  
        Cooper Brooks 
         at 320. In  
        In re Rouss 
         [(1917) 116 NE 782 at 785), Judge Cardozo pointed out that, while consequences cannot alter the meaning of legislative provisions, they may help to fix their meaning.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour concluded that the ordinary meaning of the words “act of indecency” in s 61E(2) was not their literal meaning.  
       
      
    77 The Crown contended that to accept the applicant’s submissions is to treat the words “the administration of the law” as synonymous with “the course of justice” and, thus, to fail in the duty to give meaning and effect to all of the words of s 312. In this respect, the Crown invokes the principle stated in the joint reasons in Project Blue Sky Inc at 382; [71]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Furthermore, a court construing a statutory provision must strive to give meaning to every word of the provision. In  
        The Commonwealth v Baume 
         [(1905) 2 CLR 405 at 414] Griffith CJ cited  
        R v Berchet 
         [(1688) 1 Show KB 106] to support the proposition that it was ‘a known rule in the interpretation of Statutes that such a sense is to be made upon the whole as that no clause, sentence, or word shall prove superfluous, void, or insignificant, if by any other construction they may all be made useful and pertinent’.” 
        
       
      
      
     
      
      This was a consideration that troubled James J. The only suggested meaning of the expression “the administration of the law” (other than the literal meaning of the words) was one which his Honour considered added little, if anything, to the expression “the course of justice” as it was explained in  
      Rogerson 
      .  
      
    78 The Crown’s submission (at [61] above) assumes that “the course of justice” had a settled meaning at the time the Public Justice Amendment was enacted (it received assent on 18 September 1990). At that time, there was uncertainty about what constituted “the course of justice”. So much is apparent from the discussion in R v Rogerson (1990) 51 A Crim R 359 (per Lee CJ at CL at 365 – 374), which was delivered on 11 December 1990. The authoritative statement of what constituted the course of justice came with the subsequent decision of the High Court in Rogerson. In that case, Mason CJ observed that “the course of justice” is synonymous with “the administration of justice”. To this may be added that “the administration of the law” had been used in exactly the same sense in judicial discussion of the constituent elements of contempt of court. At common law, the latter offence encompassed attempts to pervert the course of justice: Carroll at 384; Rogerson per Lee CJ at CL at 366; Archbold’s Criminal Pleading Evidence and Practice (43rd ed) at 2463.  
     
      
    79 In R v Nicholls [1911] HCA 22; (1911) 12 CLR 280, the issue was whether the publication of an article in The Mercury in Hobart, which referred to the appointment of Justice Higgins to the Court and described him as a “political judge”, amounted to contempt of the High Court. Griffith CJ said at 286: 
     
      
       
        
        “The only question for us to determine here is whether these words are calculated to obstruct or interfere with  
        the course of justice or the due administration of the law 
         in this Court.” (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
       
      Since it was impossible to answer that question in the affirmative, the motion that Nicholls be committed to prison for contempt was dismissed.  
       
      
    80 More recently, in Lane v The Registrar of the Supreme Court of New South Wales (Equity Division) [1981] HCA 35; (1981) 148 CLR 245 at 257, the Court said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “Even if the charges had been, or were now to be, amended, the evidence would not establish that the appellant committed a contempt of court. The expression ‘contempt of court’ is often popularly misunderstood. In a case such as the present,  
        the offence consists not in affronting the dignity of the court, but in interfering with the due administration of the law 
        : see  
        Attorney-General v Leveller Magazine 
         ([1979] AC 440 at 459). As Cussen J said in 
         In re Dunn; In re Aspinall 
         ([1906] VLR 493 at 497), the essence of the offence is ‘action or inaction amounting to an interference with, or obstruction to, or having a tendency to interfere with or obstruct the due administration of justice, using that term in a broad sense’”. (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    81 A little more than a decade after Nicholls was decided, Tasmania adopted the Queensland Criminal Code, with some modifications: Criminal Code Act 1924 (Tas). Section 105 was in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Any person who does any act or makes any omission with intent in any way whatever to obstruct, prevent, pervert or defeat  
        the due course of justice or the administration of the law 
        , is guilty of a crime.” (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
      
    82 Before the Public Justice Amendment, there was no suggestion that the offence provided for under the Tasmanian Criminal Code extended to conduct involving the obstruction, prevention or defeat of the functions of government bodies applying or enforcing the laws of Tasmania.  
     
      
    83 In State of Tasmania v Crane [2006] TASSC 82, Slicer J dealt with a motion to quash an indictment that charged the accused in these terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “Stephen Charles Crane at Deviot, in Tasmania, on or about the 27th day of October 2003 with intent to obstruct, pervert or defeat the due course of justice falsely pretended to transport inspector Cecil George Youl that he did not have a weighbridge docket and subsequently instigated Thomas Third to falsify a weighbridge docket indicating that the vehicle he had been driving, which vehicle had been involved in an accident, was not loaded beyond its permissible load limit.” 
        
       
       
      The judgment does not make clear whether the conduct was said to be done in contemplation of any proceedings arising out of the accident. Slicer J recorded the accused’s submission that the denial of the existence of a document in the course of questioning by a police officer was not capable of constituting a perversion of the course of justice. His Honour considered that the count was duplicitous. He granted leave to the Crown to amend. It appears to have been in contemplation that the accused would then demur to the count. The Court has not been able to find a report of any further proceedings on the amended indictment.  
      
    84 The offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice provided in s 140 of the Criminal Code (Qld) and in s 143 of the Criminal Code (WA) does not refer to “the due administration of the law”. Each provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person who attempts to obstruct, prevent, pervert or defeat the course of justice is guilty of a crime.” 
        
       
       
      Section 43(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1914 (Cth) provides: 
       
       
        
        “Any person who attempts, in any way not specifically defined in this Act, to obstruct, prevent, pervert, or defeat, the course of justice in relation to the judicial power of the Commonwealth, shall be guilty of an offence.”  
        
       
      
    85 It should be noted that, following the introduction of Part 7 into the Crimes Act, in South Australia the Criminal Law Consolidation Act 1935 (SA) was amended by the Statutes Amendment and Repeal (Public Offences) Act 1992, which abolished a number of common law offences and inserted in Part VII offences described as “Offences Of A Public Nature”. These included s 256:  
     
      
       
        
        “256(1) A person who attempts to obstruct or pervert  
        the course of justice or the due administration of the law 
         in a manner not otherwise dealt with in the preceding provisions of this Part is guilty of an offence.” (Emphasis added.) 
         
        
       
      
    86 In Police v Zammitt [2007] SASC 37, David J decided an appeal from the decision of a magistrate dismissing charges brought against the respondents, Work Care South Australia Pty Ltd and its director, who were charged with two offences of attempting to pervert the course of justice contrary to s 256(1). The charges related to attempts to claim exemption from speeding expiation notices. Rule 306 of the Australian Road Rules provides an exemption to drivers of emergency vehicles in certain circumstances. Vehicles owned by Work Care were detected by speed cameras exceeding the speed limit. On two occasions, the Director of Work Care wrote to the Expiation Notice Branch seeking to have the fines withdrawn. A police officer formed the opinion that the vehicle did not fulfil the requirements of r 306, since the vehicles were not fitted with flashing lights. The first respondent, in a letter to the Expiation Notice Branch, had made the assertion that the vehicles “have the same exemptions as any other Emergency Service Vehicle in South Australia”. David J observed that the assertions were arguably untrue (at [53)]. His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “[54] The magistrate said in her reasons: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Again the prosecutor failed to provide sufficient evidence as to the identity of the maker of the subject letters to the Expiation Branch.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          More importantly there is insufficient evidence to establish the mental element required to prove either of these offences.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Further, it is my opinion that the laying of these charges was inappropriate. The issue of expiation notices for minor traffic (and other) matters is established by the  
          Expiation of Offences Act 
          . This scheme operates to facilitate the administration of fines payments for minor regulatory matters. Once an expiation notice is received the recipient can deal with the matter in a number of ways. No court proceedings are commenced against the recipient unless he or she specifically requests the matter to proceed to prosecution. The Act also envisages that the recipient and the issuing authority can enter into a mutually acceptable arrangement to resolve the matter. There is no prohibition on a recipient from contacting the relevant authority and requesting that the notice be withdrawn.’  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        I agree that as a matter of law, putting the prosecution case at its highest, the conduct alleged could not amount to an offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour referred to the judgment of Brennan and Toohey JJ in  
      Rogerson 
       at 284, and concluded: 
       
       
        
        “[56] The magistrate correctly noted that the system of expiation notices is essentially an administrative system and not curial proceedings. The conduct alleged of the respondents cannot be said to have avoided or otherwise perverted curial proceedings, as these proceedings could only occur by the election of the respondent. It follows that counts 11 and 14 are not made out.” 
        
       
       
      It does not appear that the point now taken was considered in  
      Zammitt 
      .  
      
    87 The decision to codify the law of this State with respect to public justice offences does not appear to have followed any report of the New South Wales Law Reform Commission. Nothing in the extrinsic material to which the Court was referred assists in ascertaining the purpose of defining “perverting the course of justice” to include “the administration of the law”. At the date of the  Public Justice Amendment, the cognate offences in Victoria and South Australia were the common law offences. Among the Code States, Tasmania was alone in defining the offence by reference to “the due administration of the law”. The Tasmanian experience in the 65 years since the enactment of the Code had not suggested that the offence extended to conduct involving the intentional obstruction of the functions of government bodies in applying and enforcing the law.88 In the passage set out at [73] above, Professor Gillies queries whether the expression “the administration of the law” may have been included in s 312 to extend the scope of the offence of perverting the course of justice to include police investigations at a stage before the court is invested with jurisdiction, which do not form part of the “course of justice” on the law as it was explained in Rogerson. It is unlikely that this would serve to explain the inclusion of the similar expression in description of the offence in the Tasmanian Code, since, as McHugh J points out in Rogerson, it was not until 1933 [R v Manley [1933] 1 KB 529] that anybody appears to have suggested that a wilfully false statement made to a police officer in relation to an actual, alleged or suspected crime might by itself constitute the offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice.  
     
      
    89 “The administration of the law” does not readily describe the role of the police in the investigation of crime. Expressions such as the “enforcement of the law” or the “investigation of crime” would seem more apt if it were Parliament’s intention to include within the offence of perverting the course of justice conduct involving the obstruction or perversion of a police investigation, in circumstances in which the offender did not have curial proceedings in contemplation. In our opinion, the scheme of Pt 7 does not suggest that Parliament intended to include police investigations within the umbrella of “the course of justice” for the purpose of the offence of perverting the course of justice. This is because of the exactitude with which the offences in ss 315 and 316 were drafted (section 315A was inserted by the Crimes Amendment (Gang and Vehicle Related Offences) Act 2001). Section 315 is confined to conduct involving the intentional hindering of the police in the investigation of a serious indictable offence committed by another. A serious indictable offence is one punishable by imprisonment for life or for a term of 5 years or more (s 4 of the Crimes Act). The offence in s 316 is also confined to concealing information with respect to a serious indictable offence. It would seem anomalous, given the provision for these specific offences involving conduct intended to obstruct the police in the investigation of serious crime, if the Court were to construe s 319, by reason of the definition in s 312, as including any conduct intended to obstruct the police in the discharge of any function involving, applying or enforcing any law of the State.  
     
      
    90 We do not see how the expression “the administration of the law” could be interpreted to apply to the police investigation of crime without also applying to the activities of other public officials whose functions include applying and enforcing the laws of the State. A wilfully false statement made to a State Revenue Transit Protection Officer about the circumstances in which a weekly bus pass was lost would on such an interpretation of the provision be a perversion of the course of justice punishable by a maximum of 14 years’ imprisonment.  
     
      
    91 McHugh J made the point in Rogerson (at 304): 
     
      
       
        
        “Moreover, if, contrary to history and principle, this Court now declared that the common law misdemeanour of attempting to pervert the course of justice was established simply by the making of a wilfully false statement in relation to an alleged, actual or suspected crime, it is difficult to see how the offence could be limited to investigations by police officers. Many government officials, besides police officers, are today charged with the duty of investigating breaches of the law. Indeed, any wilfully false statement made to any person investigating whether curial proceedings should be instituted in respect of an actual or supposed civil or criminal wrong would also be arguably within the ambit of the offence. In the result, conduct which for hundreds of years has not been in breach of the criminal law would become so without legislative authority. Whether conduct which intentionally misleads police officers and other government officials should be punishable as an offence, and, if so, to what extent, must remain a matter for the legislature and not the courts.” 
        
       
      
    92 One legal assumption that informs the approach to the construction of s 312 and 319 is the assumption against extending the scope of a penal statute: Ex Parte Fitzgerald: Re Gordon (1945) 45 SR(NSW) 182 per Jordan CJ at 186 and Krakouer v R [1998] HCA 43; 194 CLR 202 per McHugh J at 223 [62]-[64]. In R v Orcher [1999] NSWCCA 356; 48 NSWLR 273 at 277 [16], Spigelman CJ, in considering whether a police officer is a “public justice official” for the purposes of Part 7, referred to, “the well-established principle of statutory construction that an ambiguous statutory provision which affects the liberty of the subject should not be read to restrict liberty.” The principle, as his Honour explained, only operates in the case of uncertainty or ambiguity.  
     
      
    93 In Plaintiff s157/2002 v The Commonwealth of Australia [2003] HCA 2; 211 CLR 476 at 492 Gleeson CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…[C]ourts do not impute to the legislature an intention to abrogate or curtail fundamental rights or freedoms unless such an intention is clearly manifested by unmistakable and unambiguous language. General words will rarely be sufficient for that purpose. What courts will look for is a clear indication that the legislature has directed its attention to the rights or freedoms in question, and has consciously decided upon abrogation or curtailment. As Lord Hoffmann recently pointed out in the United Kingdom, for Parliament squarely to confront such an issue may involve a political cost, but in the absence of express language or necessary implication, even the most general words are taken to be ‘subject to the basic rights of the individual’.” (Citations omitted) 
        
       
      
    94 In Al-Kateb v Godwin [2004] HCA 37; 219 CLR 562 Gleeson CJ expressed it this way (at 577 [19]): 
     
      
       
        
        “… In exercising their judicial function, courts seek to give effect to the will of Parliament by declaring the meaning of what Parliament has enacted. Courts do not impute to the legislature an intention to abrogate or curtail certain human rights or freedoms (of which personal liberty is the most basic) unless such an intention is clearly manifested by unambiguous language, which indicates that the legislature has directed its attention to the rights or freedoms in question, and has consciously decided upon abrogation or curtailment. That principle has been re-affirmed by this court in recent cases. It is not new. In 1908, in this court, O’Connor J referred to a passage from the fourth edition of  
        Maxwell on Statutes 
         which stated that ‘[i]t is in the last degree improbable that the legislature would overthrow fundamental principles, infringe rights, or depart from the general system of law, without expressing its intention with irresistible clearness’. 
        
       
       
        
        [20] A statement concerning the improbability that Parliament would abrogate fundamental rights by the use of general or ambiguous words is not a factual prediction, capable of being verified or falsified by a survey of public opinion. In a free society, under the rule of law, it is an expression of a legal value, respected by the courts, and acknowledged by the courts to be respected by Parliament.” 
        
       
      
    95 The Chief Justice’s observations, set out above, were affirmed in the joint reasons in CTM v R [2008] HCA 25; 82 ALJR 978 at 982 [7]. In CTM, the issue was whether the Crimes Amendment (Sexual Offences) Act 2003 (NSW), which removed the statutory defence provided for in s 77(2)(c), with respect to the offence under s 66C. Under s 77(2) (c), a person charged with an offence involving consensual sexual activity with a person aged between 14 and 16 years, had a defence to the charge if he or she had reasonable cause to believe, and did in fact believe, that the person was above the age of 16 years. The common law principle that criminal liability does not attach to conduct involving an honest and reasonable, but mistaken, belief in a state of affairs was held not to have been displaced notwithstanding the abolition of the statutory defence. 96 We have concluded that the obiter statement in Subramaniam with respect to the scope of the offence in s 319 should not be followed. The owner of the vehicle in Subramaniam had elected to have the matter dealt with by the court, and the present question did not arise. The Court did not have the benefit of the careful arguments presented by counsel which this Court has had. 97 In our opinion, the words “the administration of the law” in s 312 are not to be accorded their literal meaning, which, like James J, we take to include the exercise by a government body of its functions in applying and enforcing the law of this State. That meaning would result in a very wide range of conduct, including conduct that was not previously unlawful, being criminalised as a perversion of the course of justice. This result is a reason to consider that the literal meaning of the words may not be the ordinary meaning to be given to the expression in this statutory context. 98 The literal meaning of the words in the definition does not fit harmoniously with the scheme of the Crimes Act and Pt 7, in particular. In codifying this part of the law, the Parliament carefully defined offences and ranked them in order of relative seriousness. This is reflected not only in the range of the maximum penalties for the offences, but in the circumstance that many of the offences are made Table 1 offences under s 260 of the CPA: ss 314, 315, 316, 317, 321, 322, 323, 325, 326, 327,330, 333 (1), 335, 336 and 337. Offences listed in Table 1 may be dealt with summarily unless an election is made for trial on indictment. If dealt with summarily, such offences are subject to a maximum penalty of two years’ imprisonment: s 267 of the CPA. The offences in ss 321, 322, 323 and 333 (1), which are subject to an increased maximum sentence in the event the conduct was intended to procure the conviction or acquittal of any person for a serious offence, may not be dealt with summarily if that feature of aggravation is alleged. The Parliament reserved the offence of perverting the course of justice in s 319 as among the most serious of the public justice offences. It is not an offence that in any circumstance may be dealt with summarily. Notable is the absence in Pt 7 of an offence or offences dealing, in terms, with the obstruction of public officials or government bodies in the administration of the law.  
     
      
    99 In our opinion, the expression “the administration of the law” in s 312 is to be understood in the sense that we take Sir Samuel Griffiths to have used it in Nicholls and in the way it has subsequently been used in this area of legal discourse, which is the administration of the civil and criminal law by courts and tribunals. Understood in this sense, the expression differs little, if at all, from the expression “the course of justice” as explained in Rogerson. However, there is no reason to conclude that this was appreciated at the time of its enactment. 100 For these reasons the orders that the Court propose are as follows:

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted following a trial by jury of the murder of his wife Nevine Youseff. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of 20 years with a balance of term of 6 years and 8 months. He appeals his conviction and seeks leave to appeal the sentence which was imposed. 
     
      
    2 The trial occupied a total of 6 days. The appellant gave evidence on the fifth day. He was the first witness in the defence case, the only other witness for the defence being Associate Professor Hilton, a consultant in forensic medicine. Associate Professor Hilton’s evidence was short, it occupies 14 pages of transcript and was primarily concerned with the cause of Ms Youseff’s death. It will be necessary to return to the detail later. 
     
      
    3 Following Associate Professor’s Hilton’s evidence, the Crown Prosecutor addressed the jury. On the same day defence counsel commenced his address which he concluded on the morning of the following day. The trial judge concluded his summing up at 12.16 pm that day and the jury returned at 1.20 pm with a verdict of guilty of murder. 
     
      
       
      Relevant evidence 
       
      
    4 Although the appellant had inflicted significant other injuries on his wife the Crown case was that the appellant had killed her by asphyxiation. 
     
      
    5 The appellant and his wife were estranged. Because of the appellant’s previous treatment of her Ms Youseff had obtained an apprehended violence order (the AVO). There was one child of their union. Notwithstanding their difficulties and in breach of the AVO the appellant and his wife arranged to spend the evening of 14 December 2004 together in an hotel. At the time Ms Youseff was staying at a refuge and the appellant, concerned about the consequences of breaching the AVO, arranged to pick her up in his car at a bus stop. He had previously purchased some alcohol, including a bottle of Bourbon. They went to the hotel where they checked in. In their room they had some drinks, ordered and consumed pizza and watched some television. After a time they had intimate relations. There was also some talk between them about the possibility of a reconciliation in the future. However, the atmosphere changed when the discussion turned to the possibility of the appellant sponsoring Ms Youseff’s brother to come to Australia. This subject had been the cause of substantial friction in the past. The appellant apparently believed that Ms Youseff’s primary concern was for the welfare of her brother and this was the reason for her apparently affectionate response toward the appellant. 
     
      
    6 The appellant gave the following account of the relevant events: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: So after this news, the job, getting back to the – staying at the refuge till February to allow you to get a home? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You were not going back to your parents’ place? 
         
        A: We discussed what type of home and where we might live, what suburbs et cetera and that’s when the question arose about her brother. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Now when the discussion arose with her brother, when do you think? 
         
        A: I was so disappointed, especially disappointed. This is how we ended up in this problem in the first place with her focused on her family more than our marriage and more importantly our son. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: So what did you say or do? 
         
        A: I got upset with her and I said: ‘It’s clear where your motives are and I don’t think this is going to work’, and that’s when I proceeded to get up to get dressed and I was intending on leaving. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: So you said that to her as you got up and started to get dressed or not? 
         
        A: I was in the process of getting dressed when she continued to argue. She would say things like: ‘Where are you going’? I said: ‘I’m going to leave, I’ll be back by check-out and take you home’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: So you say that there was an argument, is that correct? 
         
        A: There was an argument, she was arguing with the fact that if I leave she’s not going to withdraw the AVO application. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What did you say to that? 
         
        A: I said: ‘That’s fine, I’ll see you in Court’. I was quite confident that those allegations would be read in court that she would face and I had the evidence to prove it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did you leave or were you intending to leave or what happened? 
         
        A: I told her that: ‘That’s fine, we’ll see you in court. You will not win and you know that very well’. And that’s when she said: ‘If I get deported then I’ll ensure that you never raise our son again’. I reminded her that he’s an Australian born child and that she will not be able to take him anywhere without my permission. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What was the tone of voice used at this stage? 
         
        A: Her voice or mine? 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Her voice firstly? 
         
        A: She was angry, she was angry because I was threatening to leave. She said when I told her that he’s an Australian born child and she would not be able to remove him from Australia without my permission she said: ‘In that case neither of us will raise him’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What happened after that? 
         
        A: I was furious, I was furious it was all the repeated threats coming back all over again. At that stage I turned around and I said: ‘Don’t ever threaten me or my son ever again’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What did you do then? 
         
        A: I was still in the process of getting dressed when she began to get hysterical and started, she started screaming out loud in Arabic: ‘Help me, help me, somebody help’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Yes, that was in Arabic? 
         
        A: This was in Arabic. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You say it was out loud? 
         
        A: It was quite loud, it was a scream. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Where was she? 
         
        A: She was on the bed at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: She was on the bed, where were you? 
         
        A: I was still getting dressed, I believe I was just getting my shirt on at the time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: So she does the screaming and you just put your shirt at the time. What did you do initially? 
         
        A: I naturally panicked, I panicked in particular with the AVO that was in place so I went back to her on the bed and I held her from behind, I held her with my hand over her mouth pleading for her to calm down. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Can you just describe what you did, you held her from behind did you say? 
         
        A: Yes, she was on her knees on the bed, I put my arm, one of my arms around her waist and the other arm over he mouth pleading with her to calm down. I was frightened from her screams early in the morning, early hours of the morning. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What hand was it that you had over her mouth? 
         
        A: My left hand. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Your left hand? 
         
        A: Mm 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What happened after that? 
         
        A: Suddenly she grabbed this middle finger and began biting at it furiously. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Do you feel anything when she had bitten your fingers? 
         
        A: Enormous pain, enormous pain. I began to struggle and my finger was between her teeth. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Could you get your finger out of her mouth? 
         
        A: No, as we were struggling then we both fell off the floor and – sorry, off the bed and onto the floor. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Your finger was still in her mouth? 
         
        A: It was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What happened then? 
         
        A: As we fell on the floor beside the bedside table we actually bumped the bedside table away from the wall and the bottle of bourbon that I purchased was sitting on the actual coffee table. As I panicked I guess without control just with her teeth grinding against my bone I actually grabbed that bottle and was striking her with it. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: So do you know where you struck her? 
         
        A: It would have been on the head. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: After you stuck her with the bottle was your finger released? 
         
        A: No, my finger was still in her mouth. At that stage she – I was leaning forwards and she was leaning forwards, we were on our knees parallel to the bed and the bottle was no longer in my hand. I had assumed at the time that it had broken because I felt all wet, everything that was in the bottle was, I was covered in it. My finger was still in her mouth, my right arm was free, no longer with the bottle, and I just pulled my finger out after a while tearing the skin. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Now you say that you hit her on the head with the bottle. 
         
        A: Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And then you feel something on you? 
         
        A: Yes, the contents in that bottle were sticky and I remember feeling wet and I think at the time I thought the bottle had broken. 
        
       
       
        
        Q; You had broken it? 
         
        A: I actually thought it had broken. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You thought it was broken because -- 
         
        A: Because all the contents, it was all over my clothes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: After feeling the contents on your clothes was she still struggling or not? 
         
        A: We were both still struggling, my finger was still in her mouth. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: After the blows to the head the bottle had broken? 
        
       
       
        
        OBJECTION. QUESTION WITHDRAWN. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: After you felt the contents of the bottle – sorry, you felt the substance on you and your finger was still in Nevine’s mouth? 
         
        A: Yes, it was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Was she still biting it? 
         
        A: Yes, she was. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What happened after that? 
         
        A: Once I released my finger I felt enormous relief, the pain was really excruciating at the time and within seconds I think of my finger coming out of her mouth with her on her knees, she was leaning forward that whole time with me leaning over her, I was actually leaning on top of her. I‘m not sure how much pressure I was applying on top of her with my hand on her face and my finger in her mouth so that she was in a kneeling position, suddenly she just fell on her side and rolled on her back. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What did you do after that? 
         
        A: Initially I didn’t think anything but then when she was motionless I said: ‘Nevine get up, Nevine get up’. I panicked, she was just not moving at all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: How did you feel at that stage? 
         
        A: I never felt anything like it. I repeated and asked her to getup and she just remained motionless on her back and – excuse me – I remember trying to get up and not being able to feel my legs at all. It was like I was paralysed from the waist down. Again I asked her: ‘Nevine get up, get up’ but she was motionless, not moving at all. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What did you do next? 
         
        A: I didn’t know what to do, everything became a blur. I actually thought I was having a nightmare and I was in shock. I didn’t know what to do and it was more surreal. I was trying to comprehend whether this was real or whether it was just a bad dream. Eventually I got up again. I’d come back towards her and asked her to get up, she remained motionless. I put my shoes on and raced out of the room and I headed towards the elevator hoping to go down and get some help. I wasn’t thinking. Well, all I knew was I needed to get some help. The elevators were not working at the time, it was that time of the morning where I think the elevators shut off so I headed back towards the room and outside our room there is an exit, a stairwell, so I raced down that stairwell which led me to the car park and from there I found myself into the street opposite the Mercure Hotel, the car park that led to the street.” 
        
       
      
    7 He was then asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: Did you intend to kill her? 
         
        A: Absolutely not. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: When she had your finger in her mouth what were your intentions on that evening? 
         
        A: My intentions were to leave, I think as I was leaving I reached that point where this marriage is not going to work and that I had been used. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: When you say leaving were you going to come back the following morning? 
         
        A: I was going to come back at 10 o’clock to check out, I needed to check out and I had a deposit there as well so I was going to check out, I was going to drive her home and say that, you know: ‘I can’t see you no more’. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: When you say you were going to check out you paid for the room in cash, did you not? 
         
        A: Which included a deposit. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You had to get that deposit back anyway? 
         
        A: Correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Now did you ever use a pillow to suffocate Nevine as has been alleged? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: To kill Nevine? 
         
        A: No.” 
        
       
      
    8 When the appellant was cross-examined the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: So as far as your mental state was concerned you were quite in control of yourself? 
         
        A: At that point, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did you lose control of yourself at some point? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: At what point? 
         
        A: When my finger was in pain, it was just excruciating pain. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Sorry? 
         
        A: It was in excruciating pain. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Excruciating pain. And up until then you had been quite calm trying to basically calm your wife down, is that true? 
         
        A: Correct.” 
        
       
       
      The cause of death 
       
      
    9 The forensic evidence confirmed significant physical injury to Ms Youseff. Dr Little, who carried out the autopsy, found the direct cause of death to be asphyxia. However, she also found that the injuries to Ms Youseff’s head could possibly have contributed to her death. Upon examination she found bruising to the face and nose, small lacerations to the lining of her lips, lacerations to the scalp and significant injuries to the head. There was also bruising of her body. Three ribs were fractured. 
     
      
    10 Associate Professor Hilton was called by the appellant. He did not examine Ms Youseff’s body. He was asked his opinion as to the cause of death and indicated that he was not as sure as Dr Little that asphyxiation was the direct cause. He said “I would not quite have put it in one word asphyxiation.” He believed that asphyxia combined with aspiration causing a spasm and concussion from the blows to the head may have in combination been responsible. However, of significance to the resolution of this appeal was his opinion that “I think there is enough indication that asphyxiation was a significant element, yes.” His disagreement with Dr Little was as to her conclusion that asphyxia was “the one and only cause of death.” 
     
      
    11 The prosecutor opened the case to the jury on the basis that the appellant had asphyxiated his wife by using a pillow to smother her. Because of the lack of supporting forensic evidence (there was nothing detected on the pillow to indicate that it had been used in this manner) this position changed by the end of the trial. However, the essential issue was whether the appellant had deliberately asphyxiated Ms Youseff, by whatever means, intending to cause her death or grievous bodily harm or whether her death was an accident. Although Associate Professor Hilton suggested that other injuries may have contributed to her death, the defence had to confront the fact that even he accepted a significant contribution from asphyxia. 
     
      
       
      Counsel’s addresses 
       
      
    12 At the close of the Crown case trial counsel for the appellant briefly opened. Nothing he said at that point would have assisted the jurors to understand the issue or issues which they would be required to resolve. 
     
      
    13 The Crown Prosecutor’s final address to the jury was relatively brief. He discussed the forensic evidence from Dr Little and Associate Professor Hilton. He argued that the jury would accept that all of the injuries occasioned to Ms Youseff were inflicted in a short space of time during the course of the struggle with the appellant. After acknowledging that the jury were entitled to reject the sequence of events as involving a pillow, he nevertheless submitted that they would find that asphyxiation was a substantial cause of death. He further submitted that the other injuries to Ms Youseff were consistent with the appellant having applied force to her head and face and other parts of her body. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “What happened is I suggest something that can be inferred quite clearly from the medical evidence and the inference to be drawn from that is that all of the injuries that Ms Youseff suffered are explicable as the accused applying pressure to her face area. I suggest to you that the rib injuries are consistent with him also at the same time applying pressure to her rib, lung capacity area and that the combination of those two things basically led to her death. 
        
       
       
        
        It’s the Crown case that the mechanism he used, however you choose to interpret the evidence, that the mechanism was deliberate, that his intention was at the very least to inflict very serious injuries upon Ms Youseff but the Crown case is that his intention at the time was in fact to cause her death and that I suggest to you is the only rational inference to be drawn from the totality of the evidence and on that basis I suggest to you the single appropriate verdict in this case is one of guilty to the charge of murder.” 
        
       
      
    14 Counsel for the appellant commenced his address on the afternoon of the fifth day of the trial. It was completed the following morning. It contains some contradictions and reveals the difficulties which counsel had in identifying persuasive arguments supporting an acquittal. During the course of his address he said to the jury that by reason of the evidence of Dr Little and Associate Professor Hilton the jury could not find that the injuries occasioned by the bottle had caused Ms Youseff’s death. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, you may also think well how would he know it wasn’t the bottle that did kill her. We know from Dr Little she says no, the bottle was not the cause of death. I am paraphrasing but later on I’ll exactly read out what she said in that account. We know it wasn’t the bottle that killed her because that’s what Dr Little said. It’s unlikely says Professor Hilton.” 
        
       
      
    15 Counsel also said that the Crown cannot say there was “suffocation.” This was a mistake which he later acknowledged. He had intended to say that the Crown could not say there was “strangulation.” The latter statement was correct in that there was no evidence of physical injury to Ms Youseff’s neck, except for limited bruising. 
     
      
    16 At a later point in his address counsel sought to establish an explanation of the events consistent with innocence. Although lacking clarity it later became clear that counsel was endeavouring to persuade the jury that his client had acted without criminal intent and that Ms Youseff was asphyxiated when the appellant sought to remove his finger from her mouth. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “What will be raised, and what has been raised, and what we will suggest, is that this incident occurred as a result of Mr Mencarious trying to get his finger out of her mouth. 
        
       
       
        
        Tomorrow I’ll draw your attention specifically to certain parts of the evidence you have heard, that will tend to corroborate the fact, and you may think will corroborate the fact, that after she was hit on those occasions with the bottle, that she was still conscious and still struggling. The cause of death: possibly asphyxia. We don’t know. But you, ladies and gentlemen, would have to determine that, based upon the evidence that has been presented. 
        
       
       
        
        The issue of self-defence being raised his Honour will give you directions in that regard as to what you can – that the onus of proof is on the Crown – his Honour will give you those legalities. 
        
       
       
        
        But, a defence to this type of indictment, ladies and gentlemen – and I remind you it is murder only that we are here to face – self-defence is a defence in certain circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    17 Counsel then made a reference to the cut to the appellant’s finger and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “That tends to corroborate what [the appellant] has been saying all along, that but for Nevine biting his finger none of this would have happened.” 
        
       
      
    18 The jury then retired for the day and the trial judge discussed the issues to be left with the jury with defence counsel. The judge indicated that notwithstanding counsel’s address he proposed to leave the alternative verdict of manslaughter. His Honour also raised his difficulty in understanding whether defence counsel was suggesting to the jury that Ms Youseff died because of “some form of accident.” His Honour also referred to the fact that counsel had referred to self-defence. His Honour reminded counsel that self-defence is available in the circumstance where a person forms an intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm by reason of their appreciation of the threat to their own safety. His Honour indicated that he did not understand the defence counsel to have accepted that his client had formed such an intention. The issues were not resolved that day. 
     
      
    19 When the trial resumed the following morning his Honour returned to these issues. Reference was made to the evidence as to the cause of death and his Honour asked counsel whether he was going to invite the jury to conclude that the death was caused by the appellant hitting Ms Youseff’s head. His Honour asked:  
     
      
       
        
        “Are you going to invite them to find that the death was caused by the blows to the head?” 
        
       
      
    20 Counsel answered “no” and later said:  
     
      
       
        
        “It is my intention to indicate to the jury that the act with respect to hitting the head with the bottle was a cause of defending oneself and, therefore, they can infer from that there was not that requisite intention to kill at that time.” 
        
       
      
    21 When the jury returned counsel resumed his address and said, inter alia: 
     
      
       
        
        “I also made mention (yesterday) that the Crown has to prove its case beyond a reasonable doubt. They must prove that the accused had that intention to kill and they said that he had that intention to kill because they claim that he suffocated her. The first submission I make to you is in relation to suffocation, because not only do we look at the evidence before you, but you may be assisted by looking at what evidence is not before you, and I will come to that in a minute. 
        
       
       
        
        I referred to self-defence yesterday and what I was intending to inform you was that the accused used the bottle to stop the victim from biting his finger. If you accept his finger was being bitten, and you accept in those circumstances that it was reasonable that the bottle was there and he grabbed it and could not stop it from happening, you may accept that he was trying to defend himself. If you accept that as the evidence, it follows you may think, if he was defending himself, he may not have had an intention to kill. But, that is a matter for you, ladies and gentlemen to determine. 
        
       
       
        
        In terms of intention to kill, if you look at the circumstances, he goes to a hotel that he has been there before, so he is well known. He signs his own hame and address – the registration. So, there is nothing to indicate a sinister motive for being there. It may be that you may be of the view that it was not pre-planned, premeditated, and you may infer that it was a domestic dispute that arise (sic) quite surprisingly, and as a result Nevine accidentally died. I say that in terms that he states on oath, that he never had an intention or desire to kill. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        We also have the circumstance that we know he was on an AVO and there were orders. He has testified and indicated that she screamed in Arabic, ‘help, help.’ He said that he returned to her in an attempt to calm her down. Ladies and gentlemen you might ask yourself: how do you stop a person from yelling? You might have left the room, but faced with an AVO and somebody yelling, that would not be satisfactory. Another way was that he went back to calm her down and put his hand over her mouth to calm and subdue her. He was saying and this is unchallenged to her ‘I will go now and come back in the morning’. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Placing the hand over the mouth. Well, you might think that might be reasonable to calm somebody down who was screaming. Certainly we know his finger was bitten and we know it is a fresh bite because the Inspector, within moments of this incident, within an hour, one would assume, makes these observations. It was obvious to him it was a bite mark and blood had come from it.” 
        
       
      
    22 Counsel then turned attention to the cause of death and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown suggests there is some sort of asphyxiation in this case. There was suffocation and I will come to that in a moment. You might think it seemed elaborate, on the spur of the moment, to think ‘I will suffocate her and hit her with the bottle’. One would have thought that the bottle would have been sufficient if that was the intention. We know, from the medical evidence, that that did not cause her death.” 
        
       
      
    23 Counsel continued, raising for the jury’s consideration whether the appellant had intended to kill Ms Youseff. He discussed the forensic evidence and the initial suggestion that it was a pillow which had been used to asphyxiate Ms Youseff. He also discussed the possibility of a sheet being involved and the appellant using his hand, the latter suggestion being that the hand had closed the victim’s nose and mouth. Counsel then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “No pillow, no sheet, no hand. You may think what’s left. Well it may well be that Professor is right. It may well be that there are a number of combinations that could have caused her death, not just this act; that if you accept this act occurred, suffocation occurred, you may infer intent to kill. In the absence of any evidence it may well be that as a consequence of him using the bottle in that circumstance she could have died from other causes. It may well be but that we just don’t know.” 
        
       
      
    24 It is evident that counsel’s address lacked clarity. Each of the extracted portions have been carefully checked and faithfully reproduce the transcript. However, it is apparent from the extracts I have quoted and further parts of the transcript , that counsel was urging the jury to find that when Ms Youseff called out the appellant attempted to muffle her cries and a struggle followed during which she bit his finger, was hit on the head, fell to the ground and died. His thesis was that the sequence of events which led to her death, however that was caused, was an accident because the appellant did not have the intention to kill her. Towards the close of his address counsel said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It could be that you conclude that there was a momentary domestic dispute but the accused did not have the intent to murder anyone. It could be a tragic set of circumstances where one thing led to another and as a consequence for reasons we don’t know she died. Sure the head injuries could be a contributing factor, you can take from that in the evidence. There are other combinations of contributing factors that Professor Hilton says may well be the cause of death. He said it was very complex. You may well think it is complex.” 
        
       
       
      The judge and counsel discuss the issue 
       
      
    25 At the conclusion of counsel’s address the trial judge again discussed with counsel the basis upon which the case should be left the jury. They discussed the part, if any, which the striking of Ms Youseff with the bottle had in the case. His Honour raised the question as to its consequence, in particular whether the hitting of the head should be confined to being a “contributing force”. Counsel responded by suggesting that the jury take that “into account as an intent to kill – sorry – they can take as to whether there was an intent to kill.” (sic) 
     
      
    26 The Crown Prosecutor contributed to the discussion. His submission was that, as he understood the situation, all that could be asserted by the defence in the circumstances of this case was that the event was an accident. The prosecutor confirmed his understanding, which is borne out by the transcript, that until defence counsel’s address to the jury the issues were framed in terms of whether there was an offence in the circumstances that Ms Youseff died from asphyxiation. The prosecutor remarked that on the Crown case, which was that some act was done to asphyxiate the deceased, there was no room for any suggestion that her death was an accident. He questioned whether defence counsel was now saying that the striking of the deceased with the bottle was a cause of her death and that this was done by accident.  
     
      
    27 The matter was apparently resolved when his Honour pointed out that at its highest the evidence of Associate Professor Hilton would lead to the conclusion that the hitting on the head was a contributing factor to the death. Asphyxiation was accepted by both forensic experts as a substantial cause of death. 
     
      
    28 His Honour was sceptical whether any issue of self-defence could legitimately be raised. His Honour also expressed his doubts that a reasonable reaction to having your finger bitten was to hit the biter on the head five times with a full bottle of Bourbon. His Honour said to defence counsel: 
     
      
       
        
        “The question I am raising is whether beating on the head five times with a full bottle of Coke is capable of being a response to having the finger bitten. 
        
       
       
        
        KLARICA: Yes, and the response. There can be an inference drawn --  
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But, do you wish to respond to what the Crown says that is the approach I should take, telling the jury simply that what was required was a proof by the Crown that however she died, it was not accidental, and that it was necessarily accompanied by an intent of a specific kind on the part of your client? 
        
       
       
        
        KLARICA: I am not comfortable with that your Honour. Sorry, could your Honour … 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes. First of all, whatever the act or acts of the accused which caused the death of the deceased, assuming they come to a conclusion as to what caused the death, that it was a deliberate act, in a sense that it was not accidental and, secondly, that whatever those acts or act, were they had to be accompanied at the time with an intention, harboured by your client, either to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. 
        
       
       
        
        KLARCIA: If it was a deliberate act. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes if they come to the view that it was an accident, they do not even get to the next question. 
        
       
       
        
        KLARICA: Yes, I am comfortable with that.” 
        
       
      
    29 The discussion concluded with the Crown Prosecutor submitting that self-defence was not available in this case because “the act causing death is not something (which) was done in self-defence, on any construction.” This was of course a reference again to the Crown case in which it was contended that death was caused by asphyxiation. If the jury found this to be the case, or found it to be a substantial cause of death, the suggestion of self-defence as an explanation for hitting the deceased was irrelevant. And, although it was not mentioned until this appeal, so also was any suggestion of provocation. 
     
      
       
      The summing up 
       
      
    30 The trial judge’s summing up was not lengthy. His Honour made plain to the jury that although the indictment contained one count of murder it carried an implied alternative charge of manslaughter. Following introductory remarks in the conventional form his Honour turned to consider the expert evidence. He reminded the jury that Dr Little’s opinion was that asphyxia was the sole cause of death. He also told them that Associate Professor Hilton preferred a more complex scenario although asphyxia was at least a substantial cause. His Honour said that Associate Professor Hilton: 
     
      
       
        
        “Thought it was asphyxia but, secondly, he thought there was some aspiration, that is, food brought up and causing a blockage to the breathing facility and faculties of the body as a result of a possible spasm. Third, a concussion which may have contributed to the death and some force that may have been applied to the mouth.” 
        
       
      
    31 His Honour reminded the jury that the Associate Professor had responded “no” to any suggestion that Ms Youseff may have died as a result of vomiting. 
     
      
    32 Shortly thereafter his Honour turned to consider the essential elements of the charge. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The next question obviously is: what are those ingredients? They are fairly simple, but to assist you I will have distributed to you a sheet of paper … what the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt is, first that it was a deliberate act, or acts, of the accused that caused the death of the deceased. Second thing that the Crown must prove that the act, or acts, of the accused which caused the death were accompanied at the time with an intention of the part of the accused either to kill or to cause grievous bodily harm. I put in brackets there that basically means really serious physical injury.” 
        
       
      
    33 His Honour then told the jury that they would need to determine the cause of death and that the Crown case was that it was caused by asphyxia. His Honour reminded the jury, as he had previously done, that Associate Professor Hilton was of the view that there may have been a combination of causes. His Honour said that the matter was for the jury. No doubt his Honour took this course because of the discussion he had with counsel. As I later explain I doubt that it was necessary. The Crown case was of death caused by asphyxiation. Having regard to the forensic evidence the defence could not legitimately argue that this was not at least a substantial cause. 
     
      
    34 His Honour reminded the jury that it was important that before the appellant could be convicted the jury must find that it was a deliberate act on the part of the appellant which caused Ms Youseff’s death. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You have heard the submissions by Mr Klarica on behalf of the accused, saying that you may come to the conclusion, and invites the conclusion, that the death of the deceased may have been accidental. If you think that is possible, then the accused is entitled to an acquittal. It is incumbent on the Crown to prove that the act of the accused was deliberate.” 
        
       
      
    35 His Honour turned to the question of intention which he described as the second ingredient which the Crown had to prove. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The second ingredient that the Crown has to prove is that the act, or acts, which caused the death were accompanied by either the intention to kill or to do grievous bodily harm. 
        
       
       
        
        You are aware, from the prosecutor’s address, that it is the Crown case, and he does not shirk from it, that the Crown says that this accused intended to kill this woman when he caused her death. But, as a matter of law, it would suffice if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that his intention was to cause her really serious physical injury.” 
        
       
      
    36 His Honour then reminded the jury of the possible alternative verdict of manslaughter and gave them the usual directions in relation to that issue. Shortly thereafter the court adjourned for the morning break. Upon resumption his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You would be aware from what I have said to you and what counsel have addressed you about that there are issues raised in this case for your deliberation concerning whether or not you are satisfied that the act or acts of the accused which caused the death such as you find causation to be and such as you find the act to be were deliberate.  
        
       
       
        
        An act is deliberate if you use will. An act is accidental if it is unwilling. In other words, it is not something which the person by an exercise of their will undertakes that is what an accident is. If you think it is possible that the deceased died as a result of an accident then, as I said to you earlier, the accused is entitled to an acquittal. On the other hand, if you are satisfied that it was a deliberate act on the part of the accused which caused the death of the deceased, and you are satisfied that it was accompanied by the requisite intention that I have defined for you, you would be looking at the crime of murder.” 
        
       
      
    37 Before concluding his summary the trial judge referred to the matter of self-defence. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is another matter that I should refer you to in passing, almost as it were, as I could explain to you in a few moments, my understanding of the raising of the defence of self-defence, is not to suggest that at any time the accused was exercising a lawful right to defend himself against attack but rather he was simply doing something in order to have the woman stop biting his finger. That is something which is … part of what I understand the accused’s case to be. When I use the expression ‘accused’s case’ I should emphasise to you that I am not in any way qualifying what I have said to you many times now, namely that the onus of proof is on the Crown. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        As I understand it, the accused’s case is this. He draws your attention to the fact that there is no identified item which could be used for suffocation, depending on what you find is the cause of death you are invited to say that there is no evidence that any deliberate act or acts by the accused was that cause of death if you think that is possibly the situation then the accused must be entitled to be found not guilty (sic). 
        
       
       
        
        The alternative argument is put to you that in any event in relation to the count of murder, that you would not draw an inference beyond reasonable doubt either that the accused intended to kill or to do grievous bodily harm to Nevine Youseff it was in that context that I understand reference was made to his hitting her with the bottle in what was called self-defence. 
        
       
       
        
        As I have said a moment or two ago, that expression I understand was used not in the context of saying he is exercising a right to lawfully defend himself from attack but rather in the context that it was his intention not to kill her, to do grievous bodily harm to her but to get her to stop biting his finger.” 
        
       
      
    38 His Honour did not discuss with the jury the detail of the appellant’s account of the relevant events. However, that evidence had been given during the course of the previous afternoon and was immediately followed by the address of the prosecutor and defence counsel. 
     
      
    39 At the conclusion of his Honour’s summing up, defence counsel raised only one issue in relation to his Honour’s directions. Counsel said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Just one thing. Your Honour mentioned intention to cause really serious injury. Would your Honour consider giving the direction in terms of distinction between intention to cause really serious injury as opposed to intention to have a finger released.” 
        
       
      
    40 His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think I told them if they are not satisfied that he had the requisite intention because all he wanted to do was to have her let go of his finger. I told them that.” 
        
       
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    41 The appellant submitted to this Court that the trial judge had erred by failing to adequately or fairly put the defence case to the jury, giving rise to a miscarriage of justice. The following issues were formally raised: 
     
      
       
      (a) His Honour did not take the jury to the content of any of the evidence of the appellant and thereby failed to identify for the jury those aspects of the appellant’s evidence which supported the defence case; 
       
       
      (b) His Honour misunderstood the evidence of Professor Hilton and misstated it to the jury in summarising the defence case; 
       
       
      (c) His Honour failed to leave or explain the relevance of self-defence; 
       
       
      (d) His Honour failed to properly direct the jury in relation to accident; 
       
       
      (e) His Honour failed to identify the particular act or acts which, on the defence case, might have caused the death of the deceased and explain the appellant’s defence in respect of those acts, namely self-defence and accident. 
       
      
    42 During the course of oral submissions to this Court counsel further submitted that his Honour should have also addressed the jury in relation to provocation. 
     
      
    43 It was accepted that apart from the issue of self-defence none of the matters now pressed by the appellant before this Court were raised by counsel at the trial and Rule 4 applies. Nevertheless it was submitted that a substantial miscarriage of justice has been occasioned and that this Court should intervene. 
     
      
    44 Although it was further submitted that the transcript reveals inadequacies in defence counsel’s understanding of the relevant law and his difficulties in articulating the appellant’s case to the jury, I do not understand it to be argued that the defence was so incompetent as to occasion a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
       
      The issues at the trial 
       
      
    45 The forensic position taken by counsel at the trial was not without ambiguity. No doubt this was in part due to the difficulties which he faced in light of the evidence. Although the physical injuries to Ms Youseff were readily apparent and not minor, the forensic experts agreed that asphyxiation significantly contributed to her death. Because the asphyxiation was undeniably caused by the appellant, whatever the particular means, defence counsel was confined to a submission that this occurred accidentally in the sense that although the appellant was responsible he had not intended to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. This is the essence of the exchange which I have recorded at [28] above. The trial judge and defence counsel agreed that the jury should determine the cause of death and then determine whether it was occasioned by accident or being deliberate was accompanied by the relevant intention.  
     
      
    46 In my opinion it was unnecessary to leave the issue of causation with the jury. As Wood CJ at CL confirmed in Moffatt v R [2000] NSWCCA 174; (2000) 112 A Crim R 201, the fact that the death of a victim may have been occasioned by more than one cause may not be relevant to the question of criminal responsibility for that death. A person may be criminally liable for the death of another if their actions make a substantial contribution towards the death. Provided the act of the person has more than a coincidental or insignificant effect criminal liability may exist: (Moffatt [71]; Smith [1959] 2 QB 35; (195) 42 Cr App R 121; Evans and Gardiner (No 2) [1976] VR 523; Bingapore (1975) 11 SASR 469 at 480; Hallett (1969) SASR 141; Osland (1998) 159 ALR 170 at 174). 
     
      
    47 In the present case the forensic evidence from both the Crown and defence witness confirmed that asphyxiation was at least a substantial cause of Ms Youseff’s death, if not the exclusive cause. That asphyxiation could only have been caused by the appellant and, there being no relevant evidence to the contrary, the jury was entitled to conclude that it was occasioned by a deliberate act done with the relevant intent.  
     
      
    48 Faced with these difficulties counsel sought an argument by which the jury might be persuaded to return a verdict of not guilty. At one point he said to the jury “if you accept this act occurred, suffocation occurred you may infer intent to kill.” This was no doubt a recognition that asphyxiation could not have occurred by accident. However, the danger in the submission was that, having regard to the forensic evidence, a finding that asphyxiation was a cause of death was inevitable. 
     
      
    49 Counsel sought to deflect the jury from a finding that the appellant intended to kill Ms Youseff by reminding the jury that the altercation was the product of a dysfunctional domestic relationship, a tragic set of circumstances where Ms Youseff was accidentally injured. It was in this context that counsel raised the issue of self-defence. Rather than suggesting that the killing of Ms Youseff was justified because of the threat which the appellant perceived, which on any view the evidence could not sustain, it was suggested that he responded to the biting of his finger and it was in order to free his finger that he attacked Ms Youseff. During the course of this struggle, and by accident, Ms Youseff died. The relevant passage from counsel’s address is included above at [21] and [22]. 
     
      
    50 There are fundamental difficulties with this argument. Even if it could be accepted that by smashing the bourbon bottle on Ms Youseff’s head and otherwise causing her severe injury the appellant was seeking to protect his finger, which the evidence of the police indicated had suffered a superficial wound, it does not explain the asphyxiation. That could not have resulted from an attempt to release his finger but required some positive act of the appellant. 
     
      
    51 In written submissions, counsel for the appellant drew the Court’s attention to the exchange between defence counsel and the trial judge at the close of counsel’s address. In that exchange counsel said: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: But if it’s a contributory force where do we go from there? 
        
       
       
        
        COUNSEL: They take that into account as an intent to kill – sorry, they can take as to whether there was an intent to kill. These are the facts your Honour. I can’t tailor the facts, they are the matters that were placed before the jury and it’s a matter of law your Honour. These are the issue that arise, I can’t change that. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Nobody is asking you to change the facts. 
        
       
       
        
        COUNSEL: Thank you.” 
        
       
      
    52 The appellant’s counsel said of this exchange: “Irrespective of what this exchange meant, counsel was conveying that the evidence gave rise to the issue of self-defence, and whilst it is accepted that his Honour did not receive appropriate assistance in resolving the appropriate directions counsel did request directions in relation to self-defence.” 
     
      
    53 The difficulties with this submission are self evident. Counsel had already said to the jury that the evidence indicated that it was not “the bottle” which caused Ms Youseff’s death. Self-defence was only suggested by counsel as an explanation for the use of the bottle, not asphyxiation. And, as I have already indicated it was not suggested that it was an act of self-defence which justified the killing. As his Honour discerned, all that was suggested by counsel was that the appellant responded to his finger being bitten and without criminal intent attacked and killed the deceased. 
     
      
       
      Summing up 
       
      
    54 The obligations of a trial judge when summing up have been frequently stated. Section 161 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 provides that a judge need not summarise the evidence given in the trial if the judge is “of the opinion that, in all the circumstances of the trial, the summary is not necessary.” The impact of the predecessor of the section (s 405A of the Crimes Act 1900) was considered in R v Piazza (1997) 94 A Crim R 459 where Grove J (who was the trial judge in the present matter) said (at 462): 
     
      
       
        
        “Subsection (3) [(of s 405AA)] preserves other obligations of the judge and the provision does not detract from the duty to communicate to the jury of what the respective cases being presented on behalf of the Crown and accused consist, and how it is that cases are claimed to be supported (or not) by the evidence. The judge is not required to restate every argument put on behalf of an accused but he must ensure that the jurors have sufficient knowledge and understanding of the evidence to discharge their duty to determine the case according to the evidence:  
        Domican v The Queen  
        [1992] HCA 13; (1992) 173 CLR 555.” 
        
       
      
    55 Hunt CJ at CL also considered the issue in Piazza. His Honour stated that a trial judge is not obliged to summarise all of the evidence in the trial. The obligation is to ensure that the jury understands the issue or issues of fact which they have to determine “and to do so with such reference to the facts of the case as is necessary to assist them in that task” (at 460). In order to discharge the obligation a trial judge may need to provide a resumé of the evidence so that the jury understands how the relevant law may be applied to it (see R v Zorad (1990) 19 NSWLR 91 at 105; 47 A Crim R 211 at 225). However, this will depend upon the circumstances of the particular case, the issues which arise, the length of the trial and the complexity of the factual matrix relevant to the particular issue: Fingleton v R [2005] HCA 34; (2005) 216 ALR 474; 79 ALJR 1250. 
     
      
    56 In the present case the appellant submitted that his Honour had failed to discharge his obligation to direct the jury’s attention to the relevant evidence. It was submitted that his Honour should have repeated the appellant’s account of the critical events, including the calling out by the deceased, the finger biting, the struggle and the appellant hitting her on the head. 
     
      
    57 Although his Honour did not summarise the evidence for the jury I am satisfied that he gave appropriate directions. The jury could have been under no misunderstanding as to the evidence relevant to the matters they were required to resolve. There was no issue in the trial but that it was the appellant who inflicted the injuries on the deceased. Furthermore there was no controversy but that it was the appellant who was responsible for her asphyxiation. The only question which his Honour and counsel ultimately agreed required consideration was whether the appellant had intended that his actions should result in her death or serious injury or whether her death was the result of an accident. That issue was identified by his Honour and having regard to the confined factual matrix there was in my opinion no reason for his Honour to have again repeated the evidence for the jury. 
     
      
    58 Having referred the jury to the fact that the evidence was within a confined compass his Honour reminded the jury of the accused’s case. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I understand it, the accused’s case is that he draws your attention to the fact that there is no identified item which could be used for the suffocation, depending upon what you find as the cause of death you are invited to say that there is no evidence that any deliberate act or acts by the accused was that cause of death if you think that is possibly the situation then the accused would be entitled to be found not guilty.  
        
       
       
        
        The alternative argument is put to you that in any event that in relation to the count of murder, that you would not draw an inference beyond reasonable doubt either that the accused intended to kill or to do grievous bodily harm to Nevine Youseff, it was in that context that I understand reference was made to his hitting her with a bottle in what was called self-defence. 
        
       
       
        
        As I have said a moment or two ago that expression I understand it was used not in the context of saying he is exercising a right to lawfully defend himself from attack but rather in the context that it was his intention not to kill her, to do grievous bodily harm to her but to get her to stop biting his finger. 
        
       
       
        
        The accused invites you to consider these matters. If you consider on the whole of the evidence that those propositions are possible scenarios, if I could use that expression, then the Crown would not have proved its case. If your doubt relates to the proof of the inference that the accused’s intention was to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm but you are satisfied that it was his deliberate act which caused the death then you would turn to the alternative count of manslaughter that I have put to you.” 
        
       
      
    59 The effect of his Honour’s remarks was to remind the jury that it was the Crown case that the appellant had suffocated Ms Youseff. Unless the jury was satisfied that this was occasioned by a deliberate act of the appellant they were told that the appellant was entitled to be found not guilty. 
     
      
       
      The “ 
      Pemble 
      ” submission 
       
      
    60 It is apparent from the authorities that there may be a tension between the adversarial nature of a criminal trial, which accepts that it is for the parties identify for themselves the issues to be tried and seek to advance the evidence relevant to those issues, and the obligation of the trial judge to ensure that the trial is fair. Counsel may, for perfectly acceptable forensic reasons, elect not to argue that the jury should make a particular finding or reason to a particular conclusion. However, the trial judge may nevertheless be required to raise that matter for the jury’s consideration. 
     
      
    61 The issue of provocation will sometimes present this dilemma as will self-defence. In a murder trial both issues depend upon a finding that an accused person committed the relevant act which may be denied by the accused. However, if the evidence could support such a finding and there is evidence the accused may have acted in self-defence or in response to provocation those issues must be dealt with in the judge’s directions, irrespective of the position taken by defence counsel. The problem can arise when counsel are incompetent (see Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; (2006) 162 A Crim R 301). However, it may also arise when counsel has made a deliberate forensic decision to eschew a particular course. 
     
      
    62 In Gipp v The Queen [1998] HCA 21; (1998) 194 CLR 106 McHugh and Hayne JJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is true that criminal proceedings are not wholly adversarial in nature. One important exception to the adversarial nature of criminal proceedings is that a trial judge has a duty to direct the jury on any matter that could result in the acquittal of the accused even though the accused deliberately refuses to argue the point” (p 124). 
        
       
      
    63 The issue was considered in Pemble v The Queen [1971] HCA 20; (1971) 124 CLR 107. In that case Barwick CJ said, after referring to Mancini v DPP [1942] AC 1 and Kwaku Mensah v The King [1946] AC 83, that where the obligation on the trial judge to direct on provocation was identified even though it had not been raised by the defence, there was a duty on the trial judge to put to the jury “any matters on which the jury, upon the evidence, could find for the accused.” (p 118; see also Windeyer J at 139, Owen J at 141). 
     
      
    64 It may be necessary to leave provocation with the jury even though it has not been raised by the defence and even though the accused has not given evidence of actual loss of self control: Parker v The Queen (1964) 111 CLR 665 at 681-682. When deciding whether to leave the issue to the jury the court should adopt a view of the facts most favourable to the accused Holmes v DPP (1946) AC 588 at 597. 
     
      
    65 However, Pemble does not oblige a trial judge to give a direction in relation to any issue unless it is raised by the evidence. The duty of the trial judge is to ensure that the jury have sufficient understanding of the issues which arise on the evidence to determine the case according to law (see Domican v The Queen (1992) 173 CLR 555 (at 561); R v Dudko (2002) 132 A Crim R 371 at [30]. Furthermore, a trial judge is not bound to direct the jury in relation to an hypothesis unless it is reasonable having regard to the evidence: R v Park [2003] NSWCCA 203, referred to in R v Gulliford (2004) 148 A Crim R 558 at [136] (see also the discussion in R v B, MA [2007] SASC 384; (2007) 99 SASR 384; Fingleton v R; Douglass v R [2005] NSWCCA 419. 
     
      
    66 The fundamental objective of the law is to ensure that an accused person receives a fair trial according to law: RPS v The Queen [2000] HCA 3; (2000) 199 CLR 620. 
     
      
    67 There was no mention at the trial of provocation. Trial counsel apparently concluded that the only means by which the appellant could resist conviction was to assert that Ms Youseff died by accident, the appellant lacking the intent required to make the killing unlawful. In my judgment, notwithstanding the overwhelming probability that the jury would reject that argument, it was all that was available. 
     
      
    68 For the reasons I discuss below in my opinion there was no obligation in the circumstances of the present case for the trial judge to have left either self-defence or provocation with the jury. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of Associate Professor Hilton 
       
      
    69 His Honour told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “You know that Professor Hilton has said that he disagrees with Dr Little, saying that ‘asphyxia is not the one and only cause of death. I think it is more complex in this instance; a potentially more complex scenario’ you remember yesterday, when he was giving evidence, he told you about matters that he thought contributed to the death. If I can just remind you, he thought it was asphyxia, but secondly, he thought there was some aspiration, that is food brought up and causing a blockage to the breathing faculties and faculties of the body as a result of possible spasms. Thirdly a concussion which may have contributed to the death and some force that may have been applied to the mouth. 
        
       
       
        
        He qualified that you might think, although the facts of the matter are for you, at least in relation to the aspiration when he was asked: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Q: Certainly this is not a case where this lady died at all from having vomited in some way? 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          A: No.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    70 It was submitted by the appellant that there was no evidence that the deceased had vomited and that Associate Professor Hilton did not suggest that vomiting was in any way connected with her death. It was submitted that his Honour’s reference to the Associate Professor’s evidence being qualified in the way that his Honour said was not correct and undermined the effect of the Associate Professor’s evidence. 
     
      
    71 I reject this submission. In his evidence Associate Professor Hilton was careful to indicate that in his view the deceased may have died from asphyxiation together with a contribution from other causes. In particular he was of the opinion that there may have been some aspiration – a reference to food being brought up and blocking the airways as a result of a spasm. The Associate Professor was also of the view that a concussion caused by the blows to the head may have contributed to her death. With respect to the possibility of a contribution from aspiration, Associate Professor Hilton accepted that Ms Youseff had not died from vomiting and any contribution from a blockage of her breathing by food matter was confined. The Associate Professor described the contribution as being possibly aspiration. All that the trial judge was doing in his reference to these matters was to identify, correctly, that the Associate Professor did not believe that Ms Youseff had vomited in a way which had contributed to her death. It must be remembered that Associate Professor Hilton gave evidence in which he indicated that he was not confident that there was evidence of aspiration. The Associate Professor said: “I am not confident there is incontrovertible evidence of aspiration.” 
     
      
       
      Accident and self-defence 
       
      
    72 I have already referred to the relevant part of his Honour’s summing up where he deals with the matter of self-defence. During the trial the appellant did not suggest that he had at any time an intention to kill or inflict serious harm on the deceased. His case as articulated by his counsel was that it was an accident. 
     
      
    73 However, during the course of defence counsel’s address a possible, although in my opinion false, issue arose. The jury were entitled to accept the evidence of Associate Professor Hilton that the striking of the deceased with the bourbon bottle had occasioned a concussion which may have contributed to her death. It was this act of striking that counsel suggested may have been done by the appellant in his defence. It was suggested that the appellant struck the deceased so as to cause her to release his finger from her mouth. However, the appellant disavowed any intention to kill or inflict serious harm. Further he could never and did not suggest that his response to having his finger bitten, hitting Ms Youseff over the head a number of times with the bourbon bottle, was a reasonable response to the bite to the finger. All that counsel was saying was that if the hitting with the bottle had contributed to her death this was an accident, there being no intention to cause the resulting harm. Of course it says nothing about the asphyxiation. 
     
      
    74 It is apparent that his Honour had difficulty in understanding how it was that this argument was to be put to the jury. I have already referred to the exchange between defence counsel and his Honour [18]. Ultimately, his Honour put to the jury what was said to be the “alternative argument.” That argument, confined to the hitting on the head, was that although not exercising a lawful right to defend himself against attack he was simply doing something in order to have the deceased stop biting his finger. In this sense he had no intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    75 Although this alternative argument was raised in my opinion it was irrelevant to the issues which were required to be determined by the jury. Because the evidence from both forensic scientists confirmed that a substantial contribution to Ms Youseff’s death was made by asphyxiation the jury need only have been concerned to identify whether that act was deliberate and done with the intention of killing her or inflicting serious harm upon her. Of course, the jury were required to look at the surrounding circumstances, including the hitting of the head with the bourbon bottle, in reaching its conclusion. However, they were not required to resolve whether the hitting over the head was done with the intention of killing or causing grievous harm. 
     
      
    76 The Crown case was that the act of asphyxiation was deliberate and that it occurred after the appellant had placed his hand across Ms Youseff’s mouth and she had bitten one of his fingers. The Crown case was that the bite was not a significant wound and was attended to by some antiseptic and a bandaid when the appellant surrendered to the police. The Crown submitted that there was a struggle in which the appellant inflicted significant injuries to the deceased’s body including breaking ribs and smashing her head a number of times with a bourbon bottle. The Crown emphasised the sequence of events including the use of the bottle to establish the appellant’s intention.  
     
      
    77 Defence counsel accepted that the issue at trial was whether the act or acts of the accused which caused the death were deliberate (see [28] above). Although my reading of the transcript causes me some hesitation it is conceivable that counsel came to this position because of a thoroughly considered analysis of the forensic options. The Crown did not ultimately seek to sustain the position that the asphyxiation was caused by a pillow. It must have been caused by something else capable of shutting off the deceased’s capacity to breath. It is difficult to envisage that this could occur by accident and the appellant did not suggest any mechanism by which accidental asphyxiation could have occurred.  
     
      
    78 Although a struggle took place the nature and extent of the deceased’s injuries was wholly disproportionate to any injury to the appellant’s finger. If the appellant contended that he acted in self-defence and accordingly was not guilty he would have had to confront two significant problems. Firstly, before self-defence could become an issue he would have to accept that he had intended the physical acts which caused her death and had intended to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm in so doing. This was in direct conflict with any suggestion that her death was an accident. Furthermore he would have had to confront the issue as to whether his response leading to the deceased’s death was a reasonable response to the injury to his finger.  
     
      
    79 In his summing up the trial judge dealt with the issue of how Ms Youseff’s death was caused and then reminded the jury that defence counsel submitted that her death may have been accidental. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you think that is possible, then the accused is entitled to an acquittal. It is incumbent upon the Crown to prove that the act of the accused was deliberate.” 
        
       
      
    80 His Honour then turned to the question of accident and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “An act is deliberate if you use will. An act is accidental if it is unwilling. In other words, it is not something which the person by an exercise of their will undertakes. That is what an accident is. If you think it is possible that the deceased died as a result of an accident then, as I said to you earlier, the accused is entitled to an acquittal. On the other hand if you are satisfied that it was a deliberate act on the part of the accused which caused the death of the deceased, and you are satisfied that it was accompanied by the requisite intention that I have defined for you, you would be looking at the crime of murder.” 
        
       
      
    81 It was submitted that this direction was wrong and in particular, that it tended to suggest that the death of the deceased was not accidental “if the acts of the appellant causing the death were deliberate.” Counsel referred to the decision of the High Court in Stevens v R [2005] HCA 65; (2005) 227 CLR 319; (2005) 80 ALJR 91. 
     
      
    82 Stevens was concerned with the relevant provisions of the Queensland Criminal Code (the Code) in particular s 23(1). That provision appears in the introductory chapter setting out the general principles of criminal responsibility which are made applicable to the substantive offences that follow. It has counterparts in Western Australia and Tasmania. As Justice Kirby observed in Stevens at [64] it is clear that the Code does not merely collect and restate the pre-existing common law. 
     
      
    83 The relevant provision is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “23(1) Subject to the express provisions of this Code relating to negligent acts and omissions, a person is not criminally responsible for - 
        
       
       
        
        (a) an act or omission that occurs independently of the exercise of the person’s will; or 
         
        (b) an event that occurs by accident.” 
        
       
      
    84 In the present case the trial judge defined accident by reference to an unwilled act and directed the jury that if they thought it was possible that the deceased had died as a result of an accident, the appellant was entitled to an acquittal. This is the direction required by s 23(1)(a) of the Code. The appellant submitted that a further direction consistent with s 23(1)(b) of the code was also required. The direction sought raised the question of whether the death was an unforeseen and unforeseeable event. The submission was made on appeal, notwithstanding the fact that there was no issue at the trial as to whether the deceased’s death was an unintended and not reasonably foreseeable consequence of the appellant’s act. It was obvious that death was a foreseeable and likely consequence of the acts inflicting the multiple injuries suffered by the deceased.  
     
      
    85 The Code draws a distinction between an act and an event: Ugle v The Queen [2002] HCA 25; (2002) 211 CLR 171 at 178 [25]-[26]; Murray v The Queen [2002] HCA 26; (2002) 211 CLR 193 at 208 [42]-[43]. In murder cases, the relevant “event” is the death of the deceased. Where death occurs as a result of the use of a weapon, such as a gun or a knife, any question of accident under s 23(1)(b) does not arise as it is obvious that death is a foreseeable consequence of a shooting or stabbing. The question which arises is whether the act of shooting or stabbing was voluntary. The same position exists when the alleged act is of sufficient violence or of sufficient force that it is plain that it may result in death. 
     
      
    86 In the present case, on the appellant’s version, all of the injuries were inflicted on the deceased when the appellant took hold of her and they struggled. The appellant’s account was that the injuries were inflicted by him by the use of force, including striking her on the head with a bottle. The appellant said that he did not intend to inflict serious injury, or any injury, but that does not raise any issue of accident, merely that the injuries were not intended. Only if it could be said that death was an unforeseen and unforeseeable consequence of inflicting multiple injuries to the face, nose, neck and upper body, ribs, striking the deceased’s head at least five times with a full bourbon bottle and the act of asphyxiation could any question of accident arise. 
     
      
    87 As Gummow and Hayne JJ said in Murray [53]-[55] where a person performs a series of deliberate acts the fact that some of them may have been performed unintentionally, without thinking, does not raise an issue of unwilled act or accident but of intention. “That is, the question was whether, in acting as he did, the appellant intended to kill or do grievous bodily harm, or had the prosecution not excluded the possibility that, as the appellant said, he had intended only to present the weapon in order to frighten the deceased” [55]. 
     
      
    88 In the present case the appellant claimed that he took hold of the deceased and placed his hand over her mouth to stop her shouting and struck her on the head to stop her biting his finger. In these circumstances the issue is not unwilled act or accident but whether the prosecution had excluded the possibility that the appellant had acted only with the intention he claimed and did not intend to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    89 The reference to an accident was if anything misleading but favourable to the appellant. There could be no suggestion that the acts of the appellant which inflicted injury upon the deceased were themselves an accident. The question was the intention with which those acts were done. In these circumstances there was no occasion for the direction which the appellant now seeks but did not seek at his trial. 
     
      
    90 As mentioned above, [[72]] the issue of self-defence was discussed at the trial but ultimately not pursued. This was for good reason. As I have already indicated it required the appellant to accept a finding that he intended to cause the deceased’s death but in so doing was acting to defend himself. The threat to the deceased was the biting of his finger. There was simply no basis to suggest, and it was not suggested, that he reasonably believed that it was necessary in order to defend himself to inflict serious injuries on the deceased, ultimately asphyxiating her. 
     
      
       
      Provocation 
       
      
    91 Like self-defence, provocation lacked an evidentiary basis in the trial. Although it was open to the jury to accept the thesis of Associate Professor Hilton and find that the striking of the head and other injuries contributed to Ms Youseff’s death, the evidence required a finding that a significant contribution was made by asphyxiation. Even if in defending himself from being bitten on the finger the appellant had inflicted blows on Ms Youseff it was inconceivable that he thought it necessary to suffocate her. Provocation raised the same problem. Even if the biting of the finger was an occasion of provocation to which the appellant responded by hitting Ms Youseff it could not rationally be suggested that having a finger bitten in the circumstances would have induced an ordinary person to have lost self control and formed the requisite intention to kill or severely injure Ms Youseff. 
     
      
       
      Rule 4 
       
      
    92 The appellant recognises that, with one exception, all of the issues agitated on the appeal were not agitated before the trial judge. The exception is said to be the issue of self-defence. In relation to that matter although defence counsel adverted to the matter it was never suggested to his Honour that a defence formulated in accordance with s 418 of the Crimes Act was available. Furthermore, when his Honour had concluded his summing up no application was made for further or amended directions in relation to the issue.  
     
      
    93 In those circumstances Rule 4 applies. In Papakosmas v The Queen [1999] HCA 37, (1999) 196 CLR 297, McHugh J said (at [72]): 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no case for the grant of leave under r 4 unless the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the appellant has an arguable case that the trial judge has made an error of law or is satisfied that the appellant's conviction is otherwise a miscarriage of justice. Satisfying the Court that there is an arguable case is extremely difficult where the appellant has failed to object to evidence or failed to ask for a direction concerning evidence. In such cases, the trial judge has made no error of law because he or she has not been asked for a ruling. Consequently, an appeal can only succeed if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the admission of the evidence or the failure to give the direction has caused a miscarriage of justice, proof of which lies on the appellant. Where the evidence was admissible, but the trial judge had a discretion to limit its use, the burden on the appellant is greater: the appeal can succeed only if the Court of Criminal Appeal is satisfied that the discretion would have been exercised in favour of the appellant and that, if it had, it is more likely than not that the appellant would have been acquitted. Any other view would mean that there was always a miscarriage of justice when the trial judge might have exercised a discretion in favour of the appellant.” 
        
       
      
    94 The significance of Rule 4 was discussed by Ipp JA in R v Galea [2004] NSWCCA 227; (2004) 148 A Crim R 220 at [21]ff. 
     
      
    95 It is apparent in this case that defence counsel was faced with a difficult forensic task. It was plain that the appellant had inflicted serious injuries on the deceased’s head and body and had asphyxiated her. As I have indicated neither self-defence nor provocation provided a plausible defence. Inherent in either issue was a jury finding of an intention to kill. A discussion in those terms would have seriously impacted upon the defence argument that Ms Youseff’s death was an accident. 
     
      
    96 As to the other complaints advanced by appellant counsel it is apparent that counsel at the trial did not perceive them to be an issue even requiring comment. In my opinion defence counsel was correct in adopting that view. His forensic endeavour, although doomed to fail, was to deflect attention from asphyxiation, complicate the matter with discussion about the finger biting and blows with the bottle and seek to persuade the jury that the death of the deceased was an accident. 
     
      
    97 In my judgment the appellant has failed to establish that on any issue raised he has an arguable case. I would refuse leave under Rule 4. 
     
      
       
      The proviso 
       
      
    98 Accepting the appellant’s version of the altercation with Ms Youseff he inflicted very considerable injuries upon her. There was no doubt that a verdict of murder or at least manslaughter was inevitable. The only question was whether the appellant inflicted the injuries with the intention of killing or inflicting grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    99 There was considerable evidence to inform the jury’s decision with respect to the question of intention. The relationship between the appellant and his wife was dysfunctional. The evidence disclosed an occasion when he abandoned her and she was found crying and shaking in a rural area. They were in serious disagreement over the custody of their son and also over the appellant’s acting as a sponsor for Ms Youseff’s brother to come to Australia. The evidence established that when the police telephoned the appellant after Ms Youseff was found abandoned in the rural area he told them that his wife had to understand her place and respect him, and that he did not want her to come home. The appellant had withdrawn his sponsorship for her continued residence in Australia and he had himself reported her to police in relation to her conduct with respect to their child. 
     
      
    100 When the appellant had ceased inflicting injuries upon Ms Youseff he left the hotel. He did not call an ambulance or seek any assistance for her. Notwithstanding her obvious and extensive injuries it was more than an hour later before he reported to a police station. Any opportunity for her to have received any necessary medical care was by that time significantly compromised.  
     
      
    101 In these circumstances and having regard to the substantial injuries inflicted by the appellant, there could be no doubt that the appellant intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her. Once it was established that asphyxiation made a significant contribution to her death a conviction for murder was inevitable. Even if the trial judge erred as is now alleged I am satisfied the appellant did not lose any chance of acquittal. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    102 The appellant was sentenced to a non-parole period of 20 years with an additional term of 6 years and 8 months. His Honour found that the offence fell “at least within the middle range of objective seriousness for an offence of murder.” Having considered the appellant’s subjective case his Honour concluded that “this is not an appropriate case in which to depart from the standard non-parole period.” 
     
      
    103 The appellant contends that in approaching the matter in this way his Honour has fallen into error. It was suggested that his Honour commenced the sentencing process by finding that the offence was in the mid range, and without further consideration determined that the standard non-parole period applied. It was submitted that in making this finding his Honour confined his consideration to objective matters and only then considered whether subjective matters required or justified a different sentence. 
     
      
    104 The sentencing judge was required to apply s 54A and s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. They provide as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        54A What is the standard non-parole period? 
        
       
       
        
        (1) For the purposes of this Division, the standard non-parole period for an offence is the non-parole period set out opposite the offence in the Table to this Division. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the Table to this Division. 
        
       
       
        
        54B Sentencing procedure 
        
       
       
        
        (1) This section applies when a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for an offence set out in the Table to this Division. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) When determining the sentence for the offence, the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in section 21A. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The court must make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period. The court must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate the sentence.” 
        
       
      
    105 This Court comprehensively considered these provisions in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. They were further considered in R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 and MLP v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 271; (2006) 164 A Crim R 93. Kirby J summarised the relevant principles in MLP in the following terms (from [30]): 
     
      
       
        
        “30.  
        As mentioned, the standard non parole period represented ""an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness"" (s 54A(2)). The Court is required ""to set the standard non parole period"" unless it determines that there are reasons for setting a longer or shorter period (s 54B(2)). The Court may depart from the standard, but only for reasons which are identified in s 21A of the Act (s 54B(3)). Section 21A obliges the Court, when fixing a sentence, to have regard to aggravating and mitigating factors (which the section identifies), as well as other objective and subjective factors affecting the relative seriousness of the offence. The Court, by s 54B(4), is enjoined to make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non parole period, identifying each factor taken into account. 
        
       
       
        
        31. R v Way, in a passage quoted by his Honour, identified the issues which must be addressed in characterising whether the offence was one in the middle range of objective seriousness (at [118]): 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the objective seriousness of the offence considered in the light of the facts, which relate directly to its commission, including those which may explain why it was committed, so as to determine whether it answers the description of one that falls into the mid-range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind; 
           
          (ii) the circumstances of aggravation, and of mitigation, which are present in the subject case, or which apply to the particular offender, as listed in s 21A(2) and (3), and as incorporated by the general provisions in s 21A(1)(c) and by the concluding sentence to s 21A(1). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        32. Simpson J in R v AJP, provided a helpful distillation of the principles emerging from R v Way where she said this: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          13 The following propositions emerge from Way and subsequent cases: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) while s 54B(2) requires, in sentencing in respect of an offence to which Division 1A applies, unless the sentencing court determines that there are reasons not to do so, that it set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence, that obligation exists where the offence in question is an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of offences of that kind; ... 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) the standard non-parole period was intended for a middle range case where the offender is convicted after trial: a plea of guilty might be in itself a reason for departure from the standard non-parole period (at [68]); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) a sentencing judge will be required, in relation to any given case, to hypothesise what is an abstract offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness in order to determine where the subject offence lies in relation to such an offence; such an exercise is, in reality, little different from the traditional sentencing exercise of evaluating objective seriousness of any offence, and should be approached intuitively and based upon the general experience of courts in sentencing for the particular offence (at [74]-[77]); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iv) circumstances that affect the evaluation of the objective seriousness of any offence include (but are not necessarily limited to) the  
          actus reus 
          , the consequences of the conduct, such factors as impinge upon the  
          mens rea 
           of the offender, matters of motivation, mental state, mental illness or disability (where causally related to the commission of the offence). Factors that affect the circumstances of the offender as distinct from the offence (for example, youth or prior sexual abuse) do not affect the evaluation of objective seriousness (at [85]-[86]); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (v) that an offence is ""typical"" or ""common"" does not dictate that it is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness (at [101]); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (vi) the numerical frequency with which an offence of a particular kind is committed is not an indicator of the objective seriousness of any individual instance of that offence (at [101]-[102]); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (vii) where a court determines that there are reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period, the standard non-parole period nevertheless remains of relevance in the sentencing determination, as a reference point, benchmark, sounding board or guidepost (at [122]); see also R v Davies [2004] NSWCCA 319. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        33. The non parole period is, of course, but one aspect of the sentence. In respect of an offence where there is a standard non parole period, the sentencing Judge must at some point address the following issues when imposing a custodial sentence: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘First, what term of imprisonment is appropriate having regard to the offence and the circumstances of the offender? Guidance may be provided by the maximum penalty, statistics from the Judicial Commission and the collective wisdom emerging from a range of sentences involving similar conduct (cf R v Trevenna (2004) 149 A Crim R 505 per Barr J; R v George (2004) 149 A Crim R 38). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Secondly, should the offence be characterised as being in the mid-range of objective seriousness? That task should be approached in the manner suggested by Simpson J, intuitively evaluating the objective seriousness of the offence and looking to those matters in s 21A, aggravating or mitigating, that relate to the offence (including the offender's state of mind). Matters in s 21A which form part of what is usually termed ""the subjective case"" of the offender are not relevant to the issue of whether the offence falls within the mid-range. If the offence falls within the mid-range, the standard non parole period should apply, subject to the remaining issues. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Thirdly, are there other reasons in the matters identified in s 21A (relating to the offender) for departing from the standard non parole period? The subjective case of the offender (issues such as youth or prospects of rehabilitation (s 21A(3)(h)) may furnish reasons for departing from the standard non parole period. It should be noted that s 21A(1) provides that the matters specifically identified in the subparagraphs of s 21A are in addition to any other matter that the Court is required or permitted to take into account under any Act or rule of law. The fact that the offender may need to serve his sentence in protection, for instance, although not mentioned in s 21A(3), may be taken into account in determining whether there should be a departure from the standard non parole period. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Fourthly, there is the issue of special circumstances. Ordinarily, the non parole period bears a relationship to the term of the sentence defined by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, that is, the non parole period must not be less than three quarters of the term, unless there are special circumstances. The sentencing Judge is therefore required to address that issue. If there is to be an adjustment, then it must not so deplete the non parole period that it is reduced below the minimum term which justice requires the offender to serve (Power v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628; Bugmy v The Queen (1990) 169 CLR 525; 47 A Crim R 433). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        34. There is no requirement that these issues be addressed in any particular order (R v Moffitt (1990) 20 NSWLR 114; 49 A Crim R 20), although the issues are obviously inter-related such that a decision on one aspect may have implications for another. In addressing these issues, the sentencing Judge should, however, bear in the mind the following advice provided in R v Way: 
         
         
          
          ‘The desirability of a judge adopting the practice of standing back after reaching a provisional sentence, and of reviewing it so as to be sure that it is appropriate for the offence at hand (see the observations made in R v McGourty [2002] NSWCCA 335 at [45]) cannot be understated, and the existence of a standard non-parole period is likely to be of assistance in this respect.’ ” 
          
         
        
       
      
    106 The appellant acknowledged through his counsel that his Honour did not approach the sentencing task by determining to apply the standard non-parole period and then oscillating about that point by reference to aggravating and mitigating factors. As I understand the complaint it is that his Honour may have confined his consideration of subjective matters to the question of whether there should be a departure from the standard non-parole period which his Honour had otherwise determined was appropriate. 
     
      
    107 I am not persuaded that his Honour has made any error. His Honour carefully examined the circumstances of the offence and made relevant factual findings. Although accepting that the striking of Ms Youseff with a bottle “occurred during an explosion of passion” his Honour determined that the act of killing by asphyxiation “fell well outside the category of low objective seriousness.” However, before determining the non-parole period which should be applied, his Honour gave consideration to subjective matters including the submission that the offence was out of character for the appellant. 
     
      
    108 His Honour also considered the submissions of counsel in relation to aggravating and mitigating factors, made a finding of an absence of genuine remorse and considered a submission with respect to the assistance given to authorities. His Honour also considered the fact that the appellant had been confined in protective custody and a medical report which indicated that the appellant had suffered depression since his wife’s death. Ultimately, having considered all relevant objective and subjective matters, his Honour concluded that it was not an appropriate case in which to depart from the standard non-parole period. In my view there is no error in this approach.  
     
      
    109 Furthermore, I am satisfied that the sentence which his Honour imposed was appropriate. The appellant submitted that having regard to the fact that he had no relevant criminal history, it was his first time in custody, there were no criminalising tendencies such as drug problems, the offence was not planned and there were good prospects of rehabilitation, the sentence was excessive. I reject that submission. The legislature has provided a significant indication of the penalty which a court should impose for an offence of this nature. I am entirely satisfied that even after consideration is given to the mitigating factors identified by his Honour, the appellant’s brutal treatment of his wife resulting in her death justified the sentence which his Honour imposed. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    110 In my opinion the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. Although I would grant leave to appeal the sentence that appeal should also be dismissed.

    1 ALLSOP P: I agree with Price J. 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    3 PRICE J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 29 November 2007 by Ainslie-Wallace DCJ (the sentencing Judge). He had pleaded guilty to an indictment containing three counts, being one count of possession of a pre-cursor, pseudoephedrine, intended by him for use in the manufacture by another person of a prohibited drug namely methylamphetamine contrary to s 24A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 and two counts of disposing of a stolen motor vehicle contrary to s 188(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    4 An offence contrary to s 24A of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act is punishable by imprisonment for 10 years. An offence contrary to s 188(1)(a) of the Crimes Act is punishable by imprisonment for 12 years.  
     
      
    5 Two offences on a Form 1, namely an offence of unlawfully obtained goods on premises and an offence of knowingly dealing with proceeds of crime were taken into account by the sentencing Judge on the sentence imposed for count one. 
     
      
    6 The applicant was sentenced on the first count to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years to commence on 17 October 2008 and to conclude on 16 October 2010. A balance of term of 1 year 6 months to conclude on 16 April 2012 was set. On the second count a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing on 17 October 2007 and concluding on 16 October 2009 was imposed. For the third count, the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing on 17 October 2008 and concluding on 16 October 2010. The overall effective sentence was 4 years 6 months commencing on 17 October 2007 and concluding on 16 April 2012 with a non-parole period of 3 years concluding on 16 October 2010. The earliest date that the applicant is eligible to be released to parole is on 16 October 2010.  
     
      
    7 The Judge had found that the applicant was entitled to a utilitarian discount of 15 per cent for the pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    8 The facts of the offences for which the applicant came to be sentenced by the sentencing Judge may be shortly stated as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: On 2 June 2005 a pharmacy was broken into and 2,155 boxes of pseudoephedrine were stolen. The applicant came into possession of 1,011 of those boxes. When he was told by a co-offender that the tablets could be used to manufacture methylamphetamine, he sold them for $20,000. During the meeting at which he was paid, there was a discussion about whether or not he could obtain more of the precursor.  
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: The applicant sold a co-offender a stolen Nissan SX 200 on 27 September 2005 for $3,500. It had been stolen in the early hours of 26 September 2005. 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: In the early hours of 25 October 2005, a Nissan SX 200 was stolen. The applicant sold the car to a co-offender for which he received $2,500.  
        
       
       
        
        Form 1 offences: Police found $39,000 in cash in the applicant’s bedroom. This was the offence of knowingly dealing with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B(1) of the  
        Crimes Act.  
        The maximum penalty for this offence is 20 years imprisonment. Police also found a portable radio which was tuned to police frequencies. It had previously been stolen from the New South Wales Fire Brigade. This was an offence contrary to s 527C of the  
        Crimes Act 
         which is punishable by imprisonment for 6 months.  
        
       
      
    9 The applicant was born on 5 August 1981 and was 26 years old at the time of sentence. Evidence of his subjective circumstances was before the sentencing Judge by way of the tender of a report from Sam Borenstein, a clinical psychologist, and a Probation and Parole pre-sentence report. Jody Balesini, the applicant’s partner, gave evidence during the proceedings on sentence.  
     
      
    10 Mr Borenstein in his report described the applicant’s childhood as being chaotic and dysfunctional which had led to behavioural problems from early adolescence and to criminal offending. The psychologist opined that the applicant’s crimes reflected that he was stuck in adolescence and may well feel tempted to return to a lifestyle which in the past allowed for inclusion and a degree of protection within a criminal network. The applicant required, in the psychologist’s opinion, careful guidance and assistance to help him reconstruct his life. Ms Balesini testified that she believed the applicant now understood that he had to change or keep returning to gaol. She was committed to the relationship but said that this was his last chance and believed that he would change.  
     
      
    11 The sentencing Judge accepted that the applicant since being in prison had made efforts to educate himself and had obtained qualifications in welding and metal work. Her Honour, however, was not satisfied that there was any convincing evidence that he had taken positive steps towards changing his life. There had been, her Honour noted, at least two periods in his life when he was employed and earning money. Her Honour observed that the applicant instead of persisting with this preferred “to engage in criminal activities which provided him sufficient funds to live for five years without work or financial support.” (ROS at p 12-13). She was unable to conclude that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend or had good prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
       
      
    12 The applicant relies in this appeal upon the following grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The sentencing Judge erred in her approach to totality and in failing to give full effect to her finding of ‘special circumstances’ in the context of the accumulation on sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Norrish QC.  
        
       
       
        
        2. A different less severe sentence is warranted and ought to be imposed.  
        
       
      
     The grounds of appeal may be conveniently dealt with together.  
     
      
    13 The applicant does not complain as to the individual sentences imposed. The focus of the complaint is on the total effect of the sentence when considered by reference to the sentences imposed upon him by Norrish DCJ on 1 December 2005. On that day the applicant was sentenced to an overall effective sentence of 4 years commencing on 6 November 2005 and expiring on 5 November 2009 with a non-parole period of 2 years expiring on 5 November 2007 for offences of stealing a motor vehicle, conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, larceny, attempt to steal a motor vehicle and accessory after the fact of receiving. Three offences on a Form 1 being the disposal of stolen property, having goods in custody and stealing a motor vehicle were taken into account by Norrish DCJ when imposing sentence. 
     
      
    14 Norrish DCJ had found special circumstances permitting an adjustment to the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and balance of term of the sentence. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The special circumstances are firstly the partial accumulation of three of the sentences which itself is a special circumstance require adjustment of the non-parole periods. I also find more importantly , as special circumstances the need for you to be assisted on your release from custody both to adjust to community living and to obtain employment and pursue educational opportunities and perhaps to receive some counselling in relation to your use of cannabis.”  
        
       
      
    15 The offences for which the applicant came to be sentenced by the sentencing Judge were committed whilst he was on bail for the offences for which he was sentenced by Norrish DCJ.  
     
      
    16 It was submitted for the applicant that the sentencing Judge had found special circumstances being the applicant’s need for support and supervision on his release from prison and need of assistance in finding employment which were in part the same findings made by Norrish DCJ. However, by virtue of the partial accumulation of the sentence with the sentence imposed by Norrish DCJ, the finding of special circumstances did not result in a non-parole period which was less than 75 per cent of the total sentence actually to be served. The applicant pointed out that the minimum period of his continuous custody will be from 6 November 2005 (the commencement date of the sentence imposed by Norrish DCJ) until 16 October 2010 which is a total effective non-parole period of just under 5 years with an additional term of 18 months. The non-parole period is around 76 to 77 per cent of the total sentence. It was next submitted that her Honour did not appear to have taken into account that an accumulation of sentence itself might result in a finding of special circumstances. The applicant contended that this Court should intervene to re-establish the proportion of the non-parole period and the balance of term established by Norrish DCJ or to maintain the length of the additional term of two years set by his Honour.  
     
      
    17 The applicant cited Cicekdag v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 218 in which it was held by James J at [49] – [50] (with whom Giles JA and Hislop J agreed) that the non-parole period imposed did not make allowance for the mental condition and consequent need for rehabilitation and supervision of the applicant in that case which had been identified by the Judge as special circumstances. 
     
      
    18 The effective balance of the term of the sentence imposed by Norrish DCJ had not expired when the applicant came before the sentencing Judge. The non-parole period had expired on 5 November 2007 and he had been held in custody bail refused from that time. As the sentence imposed by Norrish DCJ had not expired, it was necessary for the sentencing Judge to include this sentence in her consideration of the principle of totality: Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59. 19 As was explained by the Court (Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ) in R v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272 at [11]:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        One of the limiting principles that constrains a sentencing court in seeking to promote the purposes of punishment is the principle of proportionality. Another is the, not-unrelated, principle of totality and it is this principle that operated in the present case. It is the application of the totality principle that will generally determine the extent to which a particular sentence is to be served concurrently or cumulatively with an existing sentence in accordance with statements of the High Court as to the operation of the principle in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59; Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 and Johnson v The Queen (2004) 78 ALJR 616.” 
        
       
      
    20 The totality principle is designed to avoid a court imposing a ‘crushing’ sentence in the sense that “it will induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release”: R v M.A.K, R v M.S.K [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [17].  
     
      
    21 The sentencing Judge, it is clear, carefully considered the principle of totality. Her Honour said (ROS at 17): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In determining sentence for these offences I will have regard to the sentences imposed by Norrish J to consider what sentence appropriately reflects the totality of the offender’s behaviour.” 
        
       
      
    22 Her Honour considered in detail the offences which had been before Norrish DCJ and then said (ROS at 19): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In setting sentences for the present offences, I take into account that the non-parole period which I will impose will accumulate onto the end of the non-parole period imposed by his Honour. To that extent I have moderated to a degree the overall sentence that I will impose and will allow a longer than usual additional term to give the offender the benefit of supervision and support on his release from prison. 
        ”  
        
       
      
    23 As the applicant had spent twenty-one days in custody for the present offences before being sentenced by Norrish DCJ, her Honour backdated the sentence to 17 October 2007. Her Honour found special circumstances (ROS at 20): 
     
      
       
        
        “… 
        b 
        eing that the offender will need support and supervision on his release from prison and will need assistance in finding employment.” 
        
       
      
    24 The sentence imposed by the sentencing Judge taking into account the two years which the applicant had previously served, the total period he would spend in custody and his age of 26 years was not a “crushing sentence”. It cannot be characterised as destroying any expectation of a useful life after release. The applicant’s complaint, however, was not expressed in the terms that the sentence was “crushing”. The principal focus of the applicant’s challenge was, however, that the finding of special circumstances did not result in a non-parole period that was less than 75 per cent of the combination of the sentences imposed by the sentencing Judge and by Norrish DCJ.  
     
      
    25 Section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 requires that the balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one third of the non-parole period, unless the Court decides that there are special circumstances. The size of an adjustment to the statutory ratio special circumstances having been found is essentially a matter within a Judge’s discretion. As was observed by Spigelman CJ in Regina v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31] the size of an adjustment for special circumstances “raises so many matters of a discretionary character that this court should be very slow to intervene” and will not usually be interfered with unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive: see Cramp per Spigelman CJ at [36]; R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 per Spigelman CJ at [19]. There have been cases where this Court has intervened where it seems that the proportion of an effective non-parole period to an overall sentence has failed to give effect to a finding by a Judge of special circumstances: see for example Cicekdag v Reginaper James J at [50]. 
     
      
    26 The ultimate constraint, as was explained by Spigelman CJ in R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [63], upon a sentencing Judge’s discretion following a finding of special circumstances, is that: 
     
      
       
        
        “…the non-parole period must itself appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the offence.” 
        
       
      
    27 The adjustment by the sentencing Judge to the statutory ratio for special circumstances is to be found in the sentence she imposed of 4 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years. That non-parole period is 66 per cent of the sentence. When considered in combination with the two years imprisonment of the sentence imposed by Norrish DCJ, the effective non-parole period was a little over 76 per cent of the combined sentences.  
     
      
    28 The sentencing Judge was neither obliged to adjust the statutory ratio to the extent determined by Norrish DCJ nor was she required to maintain the balance of the term of 2 years which his Honour had set. His Honour’s adjustment was such that the non-parole period was 50 per cent of the total sentence which, with respect, was generous to the applicant. An adjustment of 50 per cent to the statutory ratio to maintain the proportion established by Norrish DCJ would have resulted in an effective sentence of 4 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months being imposed by the sentencing Judge. A non-parole period of this length would not, in my opinion, appropriately reflect the criminality involved in the applicant’s offending.  
     
      
    29 The offences for which the applicant stood to be sentenced before her Honour were of a serious nature and were aggravated by the fact that they were committed whilst he was on conditional liberty for offences of a similar nature. As the sentencing Judge said (ROS at 11): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        These offences were committed while the offender was awaiting sentence on substantially similar offences. They represent a continuous course of offending and were planned and organised criminal activity.”  
        
       
      
    30 Whilst an accumulation of sentence might constitute special circumstances; see for example R v Simpson; R v Close (1993) 31 NSWLR 743 the sentencing Judge was not obliged to find special circumstances for this reason. I am not persuaded that her Honour, an experienced sentencing Judge, overlooked this consideration although no mention was made of it during the remarks on sentence. It is apparent from the sentencing Judge’s remarks that her careful reflection upon the sentences to be imposed included special circumstances. There is no reason to infer that the sentence was anything other than the sentence that had been intended. 31 Unlike the circumstances in Cickedag, the balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 6 months in this case adequately meets the applicant’s need for support and supervision and for assistance in finding employment upon release.  
     
      
    32 The non-parole period which her Honour determined was, in my view, a legitimate exercise of the sentencing discretion and was appropriate for the seriousness of the offences. I am not satisfied that a lesser sentence was warranted. 
     
      
    33 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted of maliciously wounding Jim Murray with intent to inflict grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900. He appeals against that conviction. He raises one ground of appeal being that the Crown Prosecutor’s final address to the jury gave rise to a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    2 There was no complaint by defence counsel at the trial about the prosecutor’s address and rule 4 must be considered (see R v Saffron (1989) 17 NSWLR 395 at 434; R v Ita (2003) 139 A Crim R 340 at [90]; Tekely & Nagle v R [2007] NSWCCA 75 at [89]. In an affidavit read without objection on the appeal trial counsel said that he “failed to raise any objection at trial to the Crown Prosecutor’s closing address because at the time I failed to recognise his submissions as being, in part, the pressing of his own opinions on the jury rather than argument on the evidence.” 
     
      
    3 The principles which guide a prosecutor’s function when addressing a jury in a criminal trial are well known: see R v McCullough (1982) 6 A Crim R 274; Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657; R v Rugari (2001) 122 A Crim R 1; Libke v The Queen (2007) 230 CLR 559; (2007) 81 ALJR 1309; R v Liristis (2004) 146 A Crim R 547; Livermore v R [2006] NSWCCA 334; (2006) 67 NSWLR 659; R v KNP [2006] NSWCCA 213; (2006) 66 NSWLR 227 and Gonzales v R [2007] NSWCCA 321. 
     
      
    4 The principles relevant to this appeal may be summarised as follows: 
     
      
    · A prosecutor is required to act in fairness and detachment and with the objective of establishing the whole truth (Whitehorn at 663).· Although the Crown is entitled to put the Crown case firmly and vigorously this must always be done fairly, temperately and with detachment and restraint, bearing in mind that the prosecutor’s function is to aid the attainment of justice, not the securing of convictions (see Liristis at [94]).· Whether or not the prosecutor has acted with the relevant degree of fairness and detachment may depend upon the atmosphere of a particular trial (see McCullough at 286).· In considering the question of fairness it is necessary to keep in mind that a criminal trial is of an adversarial nature (see Rugari at [52]; Libke [71] and [72]).· When complaint is made it is necessary to consider whether the prosecutor’s conduct was such as to distract the jury from rational consideration of the case of the Crown and the defence (see Gonzales at [100]). It is wrong for a Crown prosecutor to become so much the advocate that he or she is fighting for a conviction and to quite impermissibly embark upon a course of conduct calculated to persuade a jury of a point of view by inspiring prejudice or emotion (see R v Roulston (1976) 2 NZLR 644 at 354). 
     
      
    5 In Livermore the court identified a number of matters in a Crown prosecutor’s address which could lead to a miscarriage of justice (at [31]): 
     
      
       
        
        (i) A submission to the jury based upon material which is not in evidence. 
         
        (ii) Intemperate or inflammatory comments, tending to arouse prejudice or emotion in the jury. 
         
        (iii) Comments which belittle or ridicule any part of an accused’s case. 
         
        (iv) Impugning the credit of a Crown witness, where the witness was not afforded the opportunity of responding to an attack upon their credit. 
         
        (v) Conveying to the jury the Crown Prosecutor’s personal opinions. 
        
       
      
    6 When it is submitted that a trial has miscarried by reason of the prosecutor’s address it is necessary to consider the whole of that address. Each case will depend upon its particular circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    7 In the present case the appellant and his alleged victim were residents of a private hotel in the Haymarket. The hotel provided single rooms for its occupants. The appellant occupied room 64 on the third floor. Mr Murray, the complainant, lived directly below him in room 45. 
     
      
    8 Mr Murray said that on the evening of 13 July 2006 the appellant was making a great deal of noise above him. He said that he had heard a sound from upstairs “like somebody using a trampoline in the room above me … it was constant until I got up and knocked on the roof and asked him to stop.” He said there were a few “fuck offs” bantered backwards and forwards and then the noise “proceeded to get worse.” There was a history of unpleasantness between the appellant and Mr Murray who said “… there was always music going on”. Ultimately, on this occasion, Mr Murray had said to the appellant “if he didn’t cut it out I was going to come up and make him cut it out, and that I would meet him halfway up the flight of stairs.” He said he got half way to the landing and there was nobody there. He asked the appellant where he was and he said he replied “I’ll meet you out there.” He then said “Well, I’m already here.” Mr Murray said “… I went to the top of the landing to see where he was and there was still no sign of him, so I put my glasses on … and went to go back downstairs … the next thing I had no glasses left on my face … I felt something hit me on this [the left] side of my head.” 
     
      
    9 Mr Murray was stabbed with a knife in his neck, left chest and left elbow. He had a deep stab wound to his neck below the left ear. There was no doubt that the appellant had inflicted these wounds. The principal issues in the case were whether or not the appellant had intended to harm Mr Murray and whether he had acted in self-defence. A subsidiary issue was whether if acting in self-defence he had used excessive force. Of significance to the resolution of these issues was whether Mr Murray was also carrying a knife. 
     
      
    10 The appellant did not give evidence but relied upon the account he gave to the police. In that account he said that Mr Murray had come up the stairs, knocked on the door of his room and then attacked him: first with punches and kicks and then threatened to kill him with a knife which was wrapped in some sort of pamphlet or magazine quality paper fashioned into a scabbard. The appellant claimed that following an attack by the complainant, he crawled to the kitchen and grabbed a knife to protect himself. He said that he “tried frantically to kill (Mr Murray). I wanted to stab him, I just went berserk.” As it happens the appellant suffered only superficial injuries. He was never stabbed.  
     
      
    11 Another resident of the hotel, Mr Grant, occupied a room on the same floor as the appellant. His evidence was that he heard a knock on the appellant’s front door then, he said, “All of a sudden it sounded like they were fighting, then it stopped.” Mr Grant did not see any of the relevant events. 
     
      
    12 The Crown case was that there were a number of circumstances which supported Mr Murray’s account that it was the appellant who had attacked him rather than the other way round. They included the following: 
     
      
    · The knife which the appellant suggested Mr Murray carried was not located nor was any paper sheath.· At one stage of his interview with police the appellant told them that he was bleeding profusely on the floor as he crawled to his cupboard to get the knife. No blood was found in his unit consistent with this allegation.· The injuries which he claimed to have suffered were not consistent with those observed by the ambulance officer called to the hotel.· Although the appellant said he was punched and kicked by Mr Murray there was only evidence of a minor abrasion to his forehead.· The appellant told police he stabbed Mr Murray once. In fact he stabbed him multiple times.· Mr Murray’s account of being attacked by surprise and feeling a blow to the left side of his cheek which stung was consistent with the stab wound found in his neck behind his left ear. His evidence was consistent with the position in which his glasses were found in the corridor. The pools of blood on the floor were found outside the appellant’s room.· The appellant did not seek help or report the matter to anyone after he was allegedly attacked. This was inconsistent with his claim that he was the victim. 
     
      
       
      The Crown Prosecutor’s address 
       
      
    13 The appellant submitted that the Crown Prosecutor’s final address to the jury led to a miscarriage of justice because of four matters: 
     
      
       
      1. The prosecutor made a submission not based on the evidence. 
       
      2. The prosecutor conveyed personal opinions or views about the evidence. 
       
      3. The prosecutor did not put to the principal Crown witness that he was mistaken about certain facts before making this submission to the jury and invoked an impermissible line of reasoning about the matter. 
       
      4. The Crown Prosecutor belittled and disparaged the appellant’s case. 
       
       
      A submission not based on the evidence? 
       
      
    14 This issue arises because of an apparent inconsistency between the evidence of Mr Murray and that of the witness Mr Grant. Mr Grant did not give oral evidence.  
     
      
    15 I have related the essence of Mr Murray’s evidence in [8]. 
     
      
    16 When cross-examined he denied that he went to the appellant’s door, thumped or kicked it or hit the appellant in the face when he opened the door. 
     
      
    17 Mr Grant’s evidence was that he heard a knock on the door followed by the sounds of an altercation. As I have related in [10] the appellant said in his ERISP that Mr Murray came to his door. 
     
      
    18 In his final address to the jury the Crown Prosecutor accepted that Mr Murray’s account of the sequence of events was not correct. In the course of his address he said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Don’t think at all, ladies and gentlemen, this is a case of Mr Murray being the aggressor in any real sense of the word. Yes, he was angry. Yes, he gave warning that he was on his way to see the accused. But think of the consequences of those two things. If you know that a person is angry with you because you’ve disturbed him, you know you disturbed them because of the noise. He had already shouted out to him what the source of the annoyance was. The accused knew why Mr Murray was on his way up to see him; and he opened the door. He opened the door. He chose not just to meet Mr Murray, I say, but attack him. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Murray said that he reached the point, if I understood his evidence correctly – but if you understood it differently, then that’s a matter for you; you can go back and check these things. But the impression I got from Mr Murray was that he didn’t make it as far as the door; and the number 64. He stopped a little way short of that before deciding to turn around and started his way back. 
        
       
       
        
        I’m going to suggest to you that Mr Murray was wrong about that. I’ve thought about the way that the evidence unfolded, all of the evidence. And I actually think Mr Murray was wrong about that and I’ll tell you why, a couple of reasons .. (not transcribable) .. when I looked at the photographs, it occurred to me that most of the blood in that whole place was immediately outside the door of number 64. Someone outside of number 64 had been bleeding very heavily and of course it was Mr Murray. 
        
       
       
        
        That suggested to me, as it may suggest to you, that Mr Murray did make it as far as the door to number 64 another fact [sic]. And again, it only occurred to me after we heard the officer admit to Mr Crawford-Fish [counsel for the appellant at the trial] that – I beg your pardon. It was me who asked an officer yesterday about a conversation that was had with Mr Grant, one of the neighbours, do you remember the one that I’m talking about that conversation and Mr Grant said that he [heard] noises from next door. He heard shouting and he said he heard banging on the door. And then he heard shouting immediately afterwards. 
        
       
       
        
        So what if Mr Murray did make it as far as the door? What if he did bang on it as one would expect this is in the evening from someone who was going up to remonstrate his noisy neighbour. What if things were a little bit different? What if things happened to that extent the way that the accused told police they happened in his ERISP, in his interview? He said that Mr Murray came to his door and banged on it. This is one of the important features of trial by jury just as her Honour told you at the beginning of the case. You have the ability, in fact you have the duty in making an assessment of the witness to say whether or not you can rely on your evidence because most things seem to be right, most things are consistent with your experience of the world and the way that things happen. Some things may be right. Do you reject the whole of the witness’s evidence? That’s a matter for you. 
        
       
       
        
        I would suggest to you that Mr Murray in being incorrect if my analysis is right about actually getting to the room doesn’t amount to a ..(not transcribable)..it doesn’t mean anything. And this is why – look at all the other things he was honest with you about, the anger, the approach; saying that he was ready for a confrontation. Why would he lie to you; that is, knowingly tell you an untruth, try and change things about such a simple little thing as moving an extra couple of steps and knocking on the door? Why would he lie? I would suggest to you that he wasn’t lying, he wasn’t knowingly telling you an untruth. He was simply mistaken. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Crawford-Fish, I’m sure, as his duty demands him will remind you of other areas in which Mr Murray had made small mistakes or didn’t remember things on this occasion as he had in the previous trial or in the statement he made to police. Hand up if you have a perfect memory. I haven’t met a human being once who does. But your duty, ladies and gentlemen is to say whether or not you can forgive the mistakes and still find Mr Murray a reliable witness and I would invite you to do exactly that. For reasons that I haven’t yet finished..(not transcribable).. there is more. And these are some of the things. 
        
       
       
        
        I suggest that on my analysis Mr Murray has arrived at the door. He’s knocked on the door loudly. What happened after that? Well, according to the accused as soon as he opens it Mr Murray launches at him with a flurry of blows to the face and knocks him down. It was only after, according to the accused’s version in the evidence, it was only after a number of blows had been delivered that he knocked the accused backwards into his own room that he was able to eventually arm himself with a knife. And he said, if I remember correctly, that he did that after seeing Mr Murray pull up his shirt and reveal a knife in a paper scabbard, a magazine sheath wrapped around it, tucked into his trousers. Does that have the ring of truth about it? 
        
       
       
        
        Here’s an armed man, armed with a knife, who goes into a room intending violence of the most serious kind. Why didn’t he use the knife first up? Why didn’t he just launch at the accused with the knife as soon as he opened the door? Why would he give another man with whom he was angry and whom he, Mr Murray, had intended to stab, why would he give him the chance to do what he did; and that’s being armed himself, why would he give him a chance to defend himself? Why wouldn’t he launch into a life-threatening attack with a knife as soon as the door ws opened/ Why bother with punches to the head at all? And I say the answer to that rhetorical question I’ve just posed is that: it is nonsense. It’s rubbish. I say what the accuse put forward is a version of this event to the police in his ERISP cannot be relied upon as an accurate version at all; save with the exception of this, he was right perhaps about Mr Murray making it as far as the door. 
        
       
       
        
        What happened, I suggest, ladies and gentlemen, is this: when the door was opened the accused was ready with the knife. He knew he was coming up the stairs. He’d had a shouted warning. Herein comes the twisted version of that old myth, the siren’s song. Was it the case the accused left the noise up loud even though he heard his neighbour shouting, remonstrating with him downstairs, threatening to come up and throw him out the window? Did he turn the sound down? Did he turn if off for fear that he was upsetting someone or that he might provoke violence? No. 
        
       
       
        
        He knew, the accused knew that Mr Murray was coming up to confront him. He knew he was angry so he was ready for him and that continued loud noise was a twisted version of a siren’s song. He left it on knowing that that would draw Mr Murray up the stairs and to his door and that’s precisely what it did. And when he opened that door, he was ready for him and he stabbed him. And he stabbed him multiple times. And he caused him very serious harm.” 
        
       
      
    19 The dilemma faced by the prosecutor was readily apparent from the objective evidence. Two significant pools of blood, which must have come from Mr Murray, were observed immediately outside the door to the appellant’s room. One appeared to extend inside the room. A trail of blood spots proceeded from these pools back toward the stairs. The presence of the pools of blood at the appellant’s door was inconsistent with the complainant’s testimony that he did not reach the doorway. 
     
      
    20 Although the prosecutor’s submission did not adopt Mr Murray’s account of the sequence of events, his submission was nevertheless based on the evidence. It was consistent with Mr Grant’s evidence, and in relation to the events prior to the altercation, consistent with the appellant’s statement to the police. In respect of the events which followed the jury were required to determine whether to accept Mr Murray’s evidence that he was attacked by the appellant with a knife, or the appellant’s case that he was forced to defend himself from Mr Murray’s attack. 
     
      
    21 As it happens by putting the matter before the jury as he did the prosecutor’s analysis of the evidence was, if anything of assistance to the appellant. The prosecutor invited the jury to reject as unreliable part of Mr Murray’s evidence. This not only gave rise to the possibility that other parts of his evidence may not be reliable, but also meant that Mr Murray had arrived at the appellant’s door at the very least in an angry mood. 
     
      
    22 In her summing up the trial judge clearly and in a balanced manner reminded the jury of both the Crown case and the case for the appellant. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The crown case is that Mr Murray is reliable and that you would accept his account of what happened on 13 and 14 July last year. The crown argued that if there are inconsistencies in his account they are minor and do not undermine his reliability. It is the crown case that Mr Murray went upstairs to the floor above to have a go at the accused about the noise and Mr Murray was prepared for a fight. It is the crown case that Mr Murray was not armed with a knife and the crown case is that the accused waited for Mr Murray and attacked him with a knife when he came upstairs when he opened the door. The crown case is that you would not accept the accused’s account of what happened, his injuries are not consistent with it, the injuries to Mr Murray support Mr Murray’s account of the fight and no knife was found. 
        
       
       
        
        The crown case is that the accused deliberately stabbed Mr Murray in the neck and upper chest and in so doing intended to cause Mr Murray serious physical injury. The crown case is that you would not be satisfied that the accused was acting in self-defence or you would be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the crown had eliminated self-defence. The crown case is that the accused did not have to open the door, he could have stayed in his room and not engaged with Mr Murray. The crown case is that stabbing Mr Murray was not a reasonable response by the accused to Mr Murray because Mr Murray was not armed with a knife. 
        
       
       
        
        The defence case is that you would not find that Mr Murray is reliable. You would find that he was carrying a knife and he went upstairs to the accused’s room armed with a knife. It was argued that Mr Murray’s account was inconsistent in a number of respects which were not minor and which, the defence says, undermines his reliability to the extent that you could not rely on it in determining the crown case. The defence case is that Mr Murray came to the accused’s door and as soon as the accused opened the door he was physically attacked, blows were struck and he was knocked to the ground, which is when Mr Murray took a knife from the waistband of his trousers and held it so that the accused grabbed a knife in fear for his own life and a scuffle ensued in which Mr Murray was wounded. 
        
       
       
        
        It is the defence case that the objective evidence, the evidence of the photos, the position of the blood, the position of the glasses and the wounds, support the accused’s account of the fight. The defence case is that what the accused said to the police at the scene and later on adopted in his recorded interview that you have seen was consistent and reasonable. It is the defence case that you would find that Mr Murray was armed with a knife and that the accused’s actions were done in defence of himself, that is, his actions were a reasonable response to the circumstances. He believed that what he did was in his own defence and it was a reasonable response to the circumstances as he perceived them to be.” 
        
       
      
    23 The critical issue for the jury to determine was whether Mr Murray had come up the stairs having armed himself with a knife. The lack of knife wounds to the appellant, although he claimed that he bled profusely, is a strong indication that the appellant’s account could not be accepted. Given the trauma of the situation it is understandable that Mr Murray may have been confused about the precise sequence. The prosecutor accepted that there was confusion but did not in my view impermissibly put to the jury an account of the events which was not available from the evidence. 
     
      
       
      Did the Crown Prosecutor convey personal opinions or views about the evidence? 
       
      
    24 On a number of occasions the Crown Prosecutor used expressions such as “I suggest”, “I actually think”, “That suggested to me” and “It occurred to me.” Although on occasions this manner of speaking was of little, if any, consequence that was not always the case.  
     
      
    25 On one occasion the prosecutor said “It occurred to me that most of the blood in that whole place was immediately outside the door of number 64.” The prosecutor should not have advanced his personal view in these terms. However, because the objective evidence was plain and the matter not in dispute this choice of language was not of significance.  
     
      
    26 The use of the expressions “I actually think” and “that suggested to me” were used in relation to a discussion about the position of Mr Murray on the landing when he was attacked. Again, as I have indicated the objective evidence resolved this issue. The blood stains made plain that Mr Murray had been stabbed in the vicinity of the appellant’s door. 
     
      
    27 Although the prosecutor introduced his personal views into the matter he did so in the manner which was different from the prosecutor’s conduct in Livermore. In that case the prosecutor effectively invited the jury to conclude that they were “slow” if they did not agree with him. In the present case, although the prosecutor injected his personal view, with which, although this was unlikely, the jury may not have agreed, any disagreement would not carry with it an inference as to the jury’s attitude to the prosecutor himself. 
     
      
    28 Although the prosecutor made the offending remarks he also reminded the jury that the case turned upon their view of the evidence of Mr Murray. He told them that they were to judge the facts for themselves and that all he was doing was placing arguments before them. The judge reinforced the position when she reminded the jury that counsel’s arguments were not evidence and that they were entitled to take a different approach to that which counsel had submitted. 
     
      
    29 In all the circumstances, although the prosecutor should not have spoken as he did, I do not believe it has led to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
       
      An impermissible line of reasoning - did the witness have a motive to lie? 
       
      
    30 Defence counsel opened the appellant’s case by submitting that Mr Murray was lying when he said he was the victim in the fight rather than the aggressor. He also put to Mr Murray that “You lied to the police about this matter in order to avoid you being charged yourself, didn’t you?” He answered “No”. 
     
      
    31 The issue in this case was clear. Either the appellant was the aggressor or Mr Murray attacked the appellant. On the defence case Mr Murray had told lies to hide the fact that he was the aggressor. Another explanation was that Mr Murray’s recollection was faulty. He was cross-examined in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: You were so angry about this noise that what you did, Mr Murray, was that you shoved a knife down your pants, didn’t you? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You wrapped it in some sort of paper sheath. 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You put it down your pants, didn’t you? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Or in your pocket. 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And you went upstairs, you charged upstairs angry, didn’t you? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You went straight to Mr Causevic’s door and you thumped on it about ten or more times? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You kicked it a number of times? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And you screamed, ‘You fucking cut it out, you fucking wog. Open up, you fucking wog cunt.’ 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Mr Causevic opened the door and you smashed him in the face, didn’t you? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You hit him in the face at least three times when he opened the door. 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And you said, ‘I’m going to kill you, you animal cunt.’ 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Mr Causevic, on being hit by you, he fell to the floor with his nose bleeding. Do you agree with that or not? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And he was kneeling on the ground at his door, bleeding from his nose, and he was trying to stop it with his hand. 
         
        A: (No verbal reply) 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You need to answer, Mr Murray 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: He grabbed the doorframe and tried to get up and you stepped back. Do you agree with that or not? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You pulled up your guernsey and you took something out from the front of your pants, didn’t you? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: It was either a black or brown-handled kitchen knife wrapped in shiny coloured paper. 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Having pulled that out of your pants, you held the knife down the side of your body and you shook the paper sheath off. 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You then moved towards Mr Causevic with the knife at your side, saying ‘I’m going to fucking kill you.’ 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Mr Causevic scrambled, moved back – was still on the ground. He moved back into his room and you moved in on him then, and you were kicking him while he moved back into his room, kicking him. 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And you were saying, ‘I’m going to fucking stab you.’ 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Mr Causevic was kicking away at you with his foot and he grabbed a knife from a shelf in his room. 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: He got up and he charged you. 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Pushing you back out of his room into the hallway. 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And he was screaming, ‘Stop or I’ll fucking kill you. Stop or I’ll fucking kill you.’ 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You were swinging your knife, weren’t you? 
         
        A: No.” 
        
       
      
    32 As I have indicated in his address the Crown Prosecutor submitted that Mr Murray was mistaken about two related matters: firstly, how far along the corridor on the appellant’s floor he had walked before being attacked and secondly, that he was mistaken in his belief that he had not knocked on the appellant’s door. However, the prosecutor did not, in re-examination, ask the witness whether he may have been mistaken about having knocked on the appellant’s door. The matter was left with Mr Murray’s evidence being inconsistent with the evidence of both Mr Grant and the appellant’s ERISP. 
     
      
    33 It was submitted that it was not open to the Crown Prosecutor to argue that Mr Murray was mistaken when the prosecutor had not put that to the witness. However, this was not a case of the Crown Prosecutor impugning the credit of his own witness, where the witness had not been afforded the opportunity of responding to that attack. It is apparent that it was put to Mr Murray in cross-examination that he had both thumped on the appellant’s door a number of times as well as kicked it. Both assertions were denied by him. The Crown might possibly have sought to ask the witness in re-examination whether he could have been mistaken about having knocked on the appellant’s door. This may or may not have met with an objection – it would effectively have been an invitation to the witness to change his evidence. However, if that was a lost opportunity it was to the advantage of the appellant. That did not prevent the Crown Prosecutor from making a submission to the jury, as happens regularly in trials, that notwithstanding the witness’ evidence on the point he was nonetheless mistaken. 
     
      
    34 A not entirely dissimilar argument to the one advanced by the appellant here was rejected by this Court in Puchalski v R [2007] NSWCCA 220 at [69]-[71]. There the driver of a car, Mr Waterman, had been shot at by the accused (who drove another car) in a spate of road rage. Mr Waterman excluded the accused from a photographic array as the shooter. The complaint that the Crown should have cross-examined Mr Waterman before putting to the jury that he had been mistaken in excluding the accused in the photographic array as the shooter was rejected. 
     
      
    35 Juries are routinely told, as they were in this case, that they can accept the entire evidence of a witness or some parts and reject other parts; that a witness may genuinely believe something to be the case but nonetheless be honestly mistaken; that a witness may be accurate in some respects but inaccurate about others. This is nothing novel. It was never suggested by the Crown Prosecutor that the witness was not telling the truth; merely that the witness was inaccurate in some details when compared to other evidence in the case. 
     
      
    36 Mr Murray had given evidence of taking strong pain killers (Panadeine Forte) as well as having consumed alcohol that night. He spoke of the scuffle with his assailant as being a blur. Apart from stab wounds, he incurred a black eye; four stitches were required for an injury to his cheek as well as other bodily bruises. He had no memory of the time between collapsing and waking up in hospital. 
     
      
    37 In his final address to the jury the prosecutor said: “Another consideration that you might make in the forming of your verdicts is whether Mr Murray himself has any motive to lie, any reason to tell the police or to present himself to the police as a victim rather than as an aggressor, rather than as an attacker.” 
     
      
    38 It is “both imprudent and inadvisable” for the Crown to invite the jury to consider the question of motive to lie, “where the question of motive has not been ventilated in the evidence”, because it risks reversing the onus of proof: Wilson v R [2006] NSWCCA 217 [55] citing R v Smith [2000] NSWCCA 468. These issues were recently addressed by this Court in South v R [2007] NSWCCA 117 where Hunt AJA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “41 In  
        Palmer v The Queen 
         (1998) 193 CLR 1 at [8], the majority joint judgment said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘To ask an accused the question: ""Why would the complainant lie?"" is to invite the jury to accept the complainant's evidence unless some positive answer to that question is given by the accused. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          As a matter of common sense, such an invitation is also extended to the jury where either the Crown prosecutor or the judge asks the jury the same question.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        42 Where there is evidence that the complainant had a motive to lie, the jury's task is to consider that evidence and to determine whether, in the light of such of that evidence as they accept, they are nevertheless satisfied that the evidence given by the complainant of the commission of the offence charged is true. The jury's task necessarily does  
        not 
         include speculation as to whether there is some  
        other 
         reason why she would lie:  
        Regina v Uhrig 
         CCA 24 October 1996 at 15-16;  
        Palmer v The Queen 
         at [8]). Nor does the jury’s task include acceptance of the complainant's evidence unless some positive answer to that question is given by the accused:  
        Regina v F 
         (1995) 83 A Crim R 502 at 511-512;  
        Palmer v The Queen  
        at [8]).  
        
       
       
        
        43 Both the Crown prosecutor and the accused are entitled to put arguments to the jury relating to the  
        evidence 
         of a motive to lie which has been asserted in relation to a witness in the particular case, and a satisfactory summing-up should include reference to those arguments:  
        Regina v Uhrig 
         at 16-17; 
         Palmer v The Queen 
         at [10]–[11]. To invite the jury to go  
        beyond 
         both the evidence supporting the asserted motive on which the accused relies and the evidence denying it on which the Crown relies, and to ask “Why would the complainant lie?” is to suggest to the jury that, in the absence of any  
        other 
         evidence beyond that on which the accused relies, they should accept the complainant’s evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        44 The jury should never be asked to go beyond the evidence on which both parties rely to establish or refute a motive to lie and to consider the question “Why would she lie?”. Such a question simply should never be asked.” 
        
       
      
    39 In the present case the issue of Mr Murray’s suggested motive for lying was ventilated in the evidence. 
     
      
    40 Defence counsel had opened on the proposition that the appellant would say that: “Jimmy Murray is lying when he says to you that he was a victim in relation to this fight, rather than the aggressor”. Further, counsel stated: “Another consideration that you might make in the forming of your verdict is whether Mr Murray himself has any motive to lie, any reason to tell the police or to present himself to the police as a victim rather than as an aggressor, rather than as an attacked”. During the trial defence counsel squarely put to Mr Murray: “You lied to the police about this matter in order to avoid you being charged yourself, didn’t you?” This followed a series of questions which had included the assertions put to Mr Murray that he had banged and kicked on the appellant’s door before attacking him. 
     
      
    41 This was not one of those occasions, unlike many sexual assault cases, where the jury would have inferred, there being no apparent reason for the victim to lie, that the witness must be telling the truth (see R v Jovanovic (1997) 42 NSWLR 520). Either the appellant was the attacker or Mr Murray was the attacker. On the defence case, Mr Murray had told lies to hide the fact that he was the attacker. The Crown was legitimately entitled to offer a reason to rebut that suggestion by suggesting that rather than having lied Mr Murray was simply mistaken.  
     
      
    42 When the prosecutor raised the possibility of Mr Murray lying he did so in the context of a discussion as to the credibility of his evidence about the alleged attack by the appellant. The prosecutor emphasised that Mr Murray had given an account of the events in which he admitted to his anger and determination to confront and deal with the nuisance which he believed was being created by the appellant. All that the prosecutor was effectively saying was that Mr Murray had admitted to doing things which might suggest he was the aggressor. If he was not prepared to lie about those matters the explanation for his evidence about not going to the door may be that he was mistaken but not that he was lying. The remarks by the prosecutor did not invite impermissible speculation by the jury. The motive to lie was clearly identified – to avoid a conclusion that he was the aggressor. All that counsel was asserting was that, given his preparedness to give evidence contrary to his asserted position, he should be accepted as a truthful, if in some respects unreliable, witness, not as a liar. 
     
      
       
      Did the Crown Prosecutor’s address belittle and disparage the appellant’s case? 
       
      
    43 The appellant complained that the prosecutor used the word “nonsense” on two occasions in his address to the jury. On the first occasion he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You heard about the alleged ferocity of the attack that Mr Murray launched upon the accused when he opened the door? Do you really think that such a big man, all 6 foot 1 of him do you really think he wouldn’t have been able to get in at least one stab with the knife that he was carrying in pants [sic], in his paper scabbard? Another reason I would suggest to you to conclude that this whole allegation Mr Murray was carrying a knife was nonsense …..” 
        
       
      
    44 Later the prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I say that it’s just nonsense that any of this had anything to do with self-defence and I’ll say nothing more about it.” 
        
       
      
    45 Although the prosecutor expressed himself in strong language I am not persuaded that in the circumstances of this case it was unacceptable. The authorities make plain that the prosecutor was entitled to firmly and vigorously agitate the Crown case. The defence position was not belittled by expressions such as a “cynical defence” (Rugari). Witnesses were not described as idiots or the defence case as being “silly” or “bizarre” or akin to a plot from “Desperate Housewives” (Livermore). In Gonzales this Court accepted, that in the circumstances of that case, it was not inappropriate for the prosecutor to describe the appellant as being “pathetic” and “absolutely pathetic”. 
     
      
    46 Whether or not the language used by a Crown Prosecutor breaches the obligation of temperateness and restraint will depend upon the circumstances of each case. The issues in this case were vigorously debated and Mr Murray cross-examined with some force. Although the prosecutor expressed himself in strong language I do not believe it was unacceptable in the circumstances. It did not occasion a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    47 The trial judge was careful to direct the jury that the Crown case rested principally on the evidence of Mr Murray. The jury were told to consider that evidence carefully and determine “whether it is reliable, that is, whether it is an honest and accurate account … it is for you to determine, whether you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Murray is a reliable witness.” They were further reminded that “it is not a matter of choosing between the versions of the accused and Mr Murray” and that their task was to “determine whether the Crown has proved its case beyond reasonable doubt.” 
     
      
    48 In my opinion the ground of appeal agitated fails and the appeal should be dismissed.  
     
      
       
      The proviso 
       
      
    49 The Crown submitted that notwithstanding the difficulties in the prosecutor’s address the jury would inevitably have convicted the appellant. Although this Court has not had the benefit of Mr Murray giving evidence before it there are a number of critical matters from which it can be concluded that his account of the events should be accepted. The inconsistency between his evidence and the objective facts can be readily explained by the trauma of the occasion. However, this is not the case with the appellant’s account. His evidence contained a number of flaws which I have identified at [10] above, which make it inevitable that his account would be rejected. Having reviewed the complete transcript I am satisfied that this was a strong Crown case. The conviction has not occasioned a miscarriage of justice.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 His Honour: This is a trial by judge alone. The accused was charged with the murder of his brother on 22 August 2007. He pleaded not guilty to that offence on arraignment before me. The issue to be resolved in this trial is very limited and does not depend upon the veracity or reliability of any of the witnesses who could give evidence about the facts and circumstances surrounding the killing of the deceased. The vast majority of the evidence placed before me was by way of witness statements and psychiatric reports. Only two witnesses were called before me and gave brief and uncontroversial evidence. There is no significant dispute as to the facts surrounding the killing and the parties are in agreement as to what my verdict should be. 
     
      
    2 There is no doubt that the accused caused the death of the deceased and that he did so intending to kill him. The accused has admitted so much in a recorded interview with investigating police. He maintained that he took the life of his brother in his own self-defence believing that his brother was going to kill him. However the issue of whether the accused did act in reasonable self-defence is not the matter raised before me for my determination. 
     
      
    3 The question to be resolved on the evidence presented to the court is whether at the time of the killing the accused was mentally ill within the M’Naghten rules. The accused has the onus of establishing that defence on the balance of probabilities. The Crown has conceded that the accused has discharged that onus. Notwithstanding that the parties both submitted that I would find the accused not guilty on the ground of mental illness, and notwithstanding my tentative view at the completion of the evidence that the defence had been made out, I reserved the matter so that I could read the significant amount of material placed before me. 
     
      
    4 The facts can be briefly stated. The accused has suffered from a bipolar disorder for many years resulting in occasional manic episodes. As a consequence he has been hospitalised from time to time and has been prescribed medication. He has also on occasions expressed paranoid delusions as a result of this mental disorder. Although there is some evidence of the accused being violent to other persons as a result of his mental disorder, these appear to have been isolated incidents the last in 2005 involving his father and sister. Generally speaking he was never considered to be a danger to anyone. It was his brother, the deceased, who often took on the responsibility of assisting the accused when he became manic by calming and controlling him. Members of the accused’s family, and presumably his brother, knew that he was resistant to taking his prescribed medication. However, the accused and his family generally appeared to cope with the effects of his mental disorder without too much concern for the consequences of his behaviour or his disturbed thought processes. 
     
      
    5 There have been times when the behaviour of the accused was very singular. For example on one occasion he told an acquaintance that he had killed a person by pushing him through a window. There has been no report of any such killing and police do not believe that it occurred. On other occasions he has said that he believed that he was being pursued by the IRA, or bikie groups and that he was a member of a non-existent military group. 
     
      
    6 At the time of the killing the accused was aged 42 years and his brother 39. They shared accommodation in a cottage on a country property outside Narromine. The accused was in receipt of a disability pension because of his mental disorder. The accused’s brother worked while the accused looked after the house. They have been described by a number of witnesses as best friends. There was never any violence observed between them. 
     
      
    7 The accused is a solid, well-proportioned man. His brother was taller and more muscular. He was described as having been a powerfully-built man of great strength. One witness referred to him as “a gentle giant”. He was never known to be violent or angry even under the influence of alcohol that he frequently consumed at a local hotel. He and the accused had common friends one being Jason Bartlett. 
     
      
    8 Shortly before the killing there was an incident when the deceased and some friends were at the property. They had been drinking and he was showing his skill with a chain saw. A branch fell against the house dislodging some guttering. The accused went to his vehicle without saying anything and drove from the premises. Later he complained of drunken parties at the house and threatening behaviour to him by those present. There seems to be no factual basis for this belief. 
     
      
    9 On the day of the killing, 22 August 2007, the accused was at the house and his brother in the hotel that he frequented. There were a number of telephone SMS messages sent by the accused. One was sent about 1.20pm to his brother asking him to stay in town that night. Another was sent at about 3 pm saying, “Please don’t come here 2nite”. At 3.43pm the accused sent an incomprehensible message to Mr Bartlett about him being two persons down. 
     
      
    10 The deceased left the hotel at about 7 pm saying that he was “gunna sort this fucking schizo brother of mine out”. He did not appear angry when he left. He was never seen alive again. 
     
      
    11 At about 8.14pm the accused sent a message to Mr Bartlett saying, “control ur pet monster please”. At 8.54 pm a friend of the deceased sent a message to the accused asking whether he could come for a visit. The accused responded, “No not home”. 
     
      
    12 At some time after this message the accused left the property. On the evening of 23 August a fire was seen in the general direction of the property. On 25 August it was reported that the house had been raised to the ground by fire. When police and fire officers attended the remains of the fire were cold. A human body, later identified as the deceased, was found in the premises with severe injuries to the skull. It was ascertained that the fire had been deliberately lit. 
     
      
    13 On 26 August the accused’s son telephoned him to tell him of the fire. In the early hours of the next morning the accused came to the premises where his son resided and persuaded him to go with him. He was acting in an unusual manner. He spoke to his son about the Covert Land Army. At one time he admitted to his son that he killed the deceased because “he was coming back to break my neck”. He said, ”I killed him, he was a bad monster to kill, I killed him in the afterlife”. He made reference to the text message that he had sent to Mr Bartlett asking him to control their pet monster. 
     
      
    14 On 27 August the accused spoke by telephone with a police officer who had been trying to contact him. When told about the fire, the accused denied having been at the premises since after having an argument with his brother on 22 August. Later that day a police officer went to where the accused was camping and saw him and his son. The accused said to the officer, “I want you to know something. I have killed a man, at least that’s what they called him, to me he was a demon the fourth worst person on earth. I don’t want you to tell anyone about this or they will lock me up in a mental hospital”. There is a later conversation with another police officer that reflects the very disturbed mental state of the accused at the time. 
     
      
    15 Later that day the accused was interviewed by police but denied any knowledge of the killing. When released by police, the accused returned to his campsite. 
     
      
    16 On 18 September the accused’s mother and his son attended at the campsite. The accused’s behaviour toward his mother was unusual. He admitted killing his brother but said that he, the deceased, was evil when drunk. He said his brother was trying to get him out of the house. When asked by his mother why he did it when they were best mates, he replied,” I did it with my bare hands”. 
     
      
    17 Later that day the accused was arrested. He participated in a lengthy interview with police, during which he admitted killing his brother. In effect his account was that he acted in self-defence believing that his brother wanted to kill him. He said that he received a telephone call from the hotel threatening to kill him. Later his brother arrived at the property in his vehicle and crashed through the gate, which the accused had earlier fastened closed, then colliding with the accused’s vehicle. He kicked in the door and threw the accused against the wall. They fought and the accused broke his neck. He then took an axe and “crossed” his brother on the head. The accused spoke of battling his brother in the afterlife. He denied having set fire to the house. The accused was arrested and charged with the murder of his brother. 
     
      
    18 The defence of mental illness arises where the accused proves that at the time of the killing he was suffering from such a defect of reasoning arising from a disease of the mind that he did not know the nature and quality of what he was doing or that what he was doing was wrong. Here the defence is that the accused was labouring under a delusion that his brother was intending to kill him and that it was necessary to do what he did in his own defence. It is submitted that this belief was a direct result of paranoid thoughts arising from his mental illness. 
     
      
    19 This contention is supported by both the psychiatrist retained by the Crown, Dr Brown, and that retained by the defence, Dr Westmore. Each of the psychiatrists prepared two reports. Neither was prepared to find the defence established on his or her initial assessment of the accused and the material with which they had been supplied. However, after receiving further material, both psychiatrists reviewed their earlier opinions. 
     
      
    20 In her initial report Dr Brown was not prepared to find that the accused had made out the defence of mental illness although she did accept that a partial defence based upon substantial mental impairment would be available under s 23A of the Crimes Act. However in her second report of 18 August 2008, having considered further material, including the text messages sent by the accused on the night of the killing and what he said to the police officer at the campsite, Dr Brown was satisfied that the defence was available. The material in the prosecution brief indicated to her a “paranoid line of thinking” that would have had the capacity to impair the accused’s understanding of the wrongfulness of his actions. She gave evidence before me that she was confident in the correctness of her second opinion. As I have already indicated, the Crown has accepted the validity of her opinion. 
     
      
    21 In his first report Dr Westmore was unable to form any view as to the accused’s mental state at the time of the killing without further material that he requested. The second report dated 14 April 2008 was prepared after he had obtained this information and deals with the issue of the mental illness defence. In the report Dr Westmore reviews a number of witness statements that contain material relevant to the accused’s disordered state of mind. As a result of his further consideration, Dr Westmore concludes that the accused was suffering from a mental illness being probably a “bipolar affective disorder with psychotic symptoms”. As I understand it, this is the same diagnosis as given by Dr Brown. Although Dr Westmore describes as “difficult” the question of whether that disorder affected the accused’s behaviour at the time of the killing, he went on to conclude that the defence is available as is the partial defence under s 23A. It is of course not unusual that the same material supports both defences. 
     
      
    22 It is clear that both psychiatrists accept the probability that, by reason of his mental illness the accused formed the belief that his bother intended to kill him, even though there was no basis in reality for that belief. There was also the delusional belief that his brother could return from the dead. The mental illness would not only have deprived him of the capacity to control his behaviour, the basis of a defence under s 23A, but also rendered him incapable of knowing that what he did in relation to his brother was wrong. The accused’s mental state at the time of the killing falls within the M’Naghten rules of mental illness. 
     
      
    23 It may well be the case that the accused would have seen any attempt at administration of physical restrain or control by his brother on the night of 22 August, which he normally would accept, as falling within his delusional belief that his brother intended him harm. 
     
      
    24 If I were instructing a jury in this matter I would be required to indicate to them the consequences of the available verdicts. However I do not believe that I need to refer to those matters in this judgment although I understand the consequences of a verdict of not guilty on the grounds of mental illness.  
     
      
    25 Having considered all the material placed before me, it is clear that the accused intentionally killed his brother intending to bring about his death. That finding makes him liable to be convicted of the crime of murder. However, having regard to the psychiatric reports and the material upon which the opinions of the psychiatrists are based, I find that the defence of mental illness is made out. 
     
      
       
      Verdict: 
      
    26 The accused is not guilty of the crime of murder on the ground of mental illness. I order that the accused be deained in the custody of the Department of Corrective Services until released by due process of law. The Registrar is to notify the Minister for Health and the Mental Health Tribunal of the verdict and the orders made by the court.

     Adam Rawdon CARLTON v THE QUEEN 
     
     
      
       
       Headnote 
       
      
    On 3 August 2006, Mr Carlton (“the appellant”) was convicted of four counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, involving a person under 16 years of age, contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offences took place on 20 August 2005 in a unit in Canowindra. On 23 February 2007, the appellant was sentenced on each count to a non-parole period of eight years, six months, with an additional period of four years, 10 months, giving a total term of 13 years, four months. The trial judge ordered that the sentences be served concurrently.The appellant sought leave to appeal against his convictions and against the sentences passed on him on each conviction. The Court granted leave to appeal.The issues for determination on appeal were:(i) with respect to conviction: 
     
      
      (a) whether the trial judge made specific errors in his summing-up; and  
       
       
      (b) whether there was a miscarriage of justice because the summing-up lacked balance and was unfair; and 
       
      
    (ii) in relation to sentence: whether the trial judge failed to give proper weight to the appellant’s mental illness.The Court held, dismissing the appeal:In relation to (1)(a)(per Basten JA, Hislop and Price JJA agreeing)1. The trial judge gave misleading, confusing or prejudicial directions by: 
     
      
      (a) referring to the appellant as a drug dealer: [18], [117], [118]; 
       
      (b) mischaracterising the appellant’s denials in relation to the dildo and vibrator: [32]–[33], [117], [118]; and  
       
      (c) directing that it was possible that the complainant’s DNA was on the vibrator: [40], [117], [118]. 
      
    2. The trial judge sought to correct each error: 
     
      
      (a) He stated that he had misunderstood the evidence about drug dealing and directed the jury to disregard what he had said about it. Although the correction was inadequate, the error could not have caused a miscarriage of justice: [22], [117], [118]. 
       
      (b) Despite the potential for confusion about the appellant’s denials, the trial judge’s direction about the appellant’s denials did not demonstrate a miscarriage of justice. The complainant’s accurate description was far more powerful evidence in support of her complaint, than disbelief of the appellant’s denials: [34], [117], [118].  
       
      (c) The trial judge’s error about the DNA evidence was troubling because his language departed from that of the forensic biologist, who gave evidence on DNA in response to a precisely formulated leading question from the prosecutor. The trial judge’s initial direction invited speculation as to how the error could have arisen and there was a risk that the jury might have speculated as to the source of his error: [42], [117], [118]. 
      
    In relation to (1)(b)(per Basten JA, Hislop and Price JJA agreeing)3. Where a complaint is based upon a lack of “balance” or fairness in the summing-up, it is often necessary to evaluate the summing-up as a whole and in the context of the evidence and the addresses of counsel. The Court must be satisfied that there are irregularities which might constitute a miscarriage of justice, and to assess the materiality of those irregularities: [70], [117], [118].4. “Miscarriage of justice” can have two points of reference: first, it may refer to the fairness of the process of a criminal trial; secondly, it may be directed to the soundness of the verdict: [71].

    5. Although there were aspects of the trial judge’s summing-up in the present case which revealed inadequacies or irregularities, they were not so material as to amount to a significant denial of procedural fairness. The jury’s rejection of some counts suggested that the jury was not prepared to rely upon the complainant’s evidence alone: [72]–[80], [117], [118]. 6. So far as the question of balance was concerned, the challenge related to matters of omission, rather than commission. The irregularities in the trial judge’s summing-up were unlikely to have had any significant bearing on the outcome of the case. Moreover, their effect was to a significant extent ameliorated by the recent and comprehensive analysis of counsel for the accused: [83], [117], [118]. That the summing-up, taken as a whole, did not demonstrate glaring imbalance could be inferred from the failure of counsel to take any further objection when the opportunity arose: [61], [83], [117], [118]. Accordingly, no substantial miscarriage of justice actually occurred: [84], [117], [118].

    In relation to (ii) (per Basten JA, Hislop and Price JJA agreeing)7. The combination of limited association and schizophrenia were likely to render prison more onerous for the appellant than for a person to whom either of those conditions applied separately. The trial judge failed to take account of the combined effect of his mental illness and his segregation within the prison system: [112], [117], [118]. (per Price JA, Hislop JA agreeing)8. However, the imposition of totally concurrent sentences failed to acknowledge the separate harm done to the complainant by the criminal acts of the appellant. A sentencing court should take care to ensure that consideration of an offender’s behaviour being closely related in time does not obscure the fact that different offences were committed. No lesser sentence was warranted: [117], [122].(per Basten JA, dissenting)9. The need to stabilise the appellant on return to the community in terms of his mental condition and the removal from onerous conditions of non-association justified a longer than usual period on parole: [113].

    10.

     Adam Rawdon CARLTON v THE QUEEN 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: On 3 August 2006 Mr Carlton was convicted of four counts of aggravated sexual intercourse without consent, involving a person under 16 years of age, contrary to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). The offences took place in a unit in Gaskill Street, Canowindra on 20 August 2005. The complainant was at the time of the offences a 10-year-old girl. 
     
      
    2 The four offences involved three counts of anal penetration, the first being digital, the second penile and the third involving a blue-coloured vibrator. The fourth count involved penile penetration of the appellant’s genitalia, identified by the prosecution as vulval intercourse, the medical evidence not supporting the complaint of vaginal penetration. 
     
      
    3 Based on the complainant’s evidence, four other counts were laid, on which the appellant was found not guilty. These involved two counts of penetration or attempted penetration (one penile, the other involving the vibrator) of the complainant’s genitalia, one count of oral penile penetration and one involving the accused placing the complainant’s hand on his penis. 
     
      
    4 The primary evidence underlying each of the counts was the oral testimony of the complainant. The appellant did not give evidence, but participated in a lengthy recorded interview with police, in the course of which he denied the allegations of sexual misconduct. The record was tendered by the prosecution. 
     
      
    5 The trial undoubtedly turned upon the evidence of the complainant, the prosecution relying on the degree of consistency in her account as revealed to a number of third parties, including the police, and on objective evidence which tended to support her veracity. The defence sought to rely upon the fact that the full story had only come forward over time, a degree of inconsistency in aspects of her account, objective facts which were inconsistent with her account and matters which could have been known to the complainant, absent the sexual misconduct. 
     
      
    6 The differential treatment of the various counts in the indictment reveals that the jury did not accept everything related by the complainant as established beyond reasonable doubt. It will be necessary to address the apparent basis of distinction in considering the appeal against the convictions. 
     
      
    7 Each of the four counts upon which the appellant was convicted carried a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 10 years, as specified in the table to Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“Sentencing Procedure Act”). 
     
      
    8 On 23 February 2007 the appellant was sentenced on each count to a non-parole period of 8 years 6 months, with an additional period of 4 years 10 months, giving a total term of 13 years 4 months. The sentences were ordered to be served concurrently and commenced on 21 August 2005. 
     
      
    Proceedings in this Court9 The appellant seeks to appeal against his convictions and also seeks leave to appeal against the sentences passed upon him on each conviction. 
     
      
    10 This Court may set aside a conviction on the various grounds identified in s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), including any ground giving rise to a miscarriage of justice. That may involve a challenge to the procedures adopted at trial, an assessment of facts or an error of law. However, except in relation to a ground which involves “a question of law alone” the appellant is required to obtain leave: Criminal Appeal Act, s 5(1); Krishna v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2007] NSWCCA 318 at [2]; Alramadan v Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) [2007] NSWCCA 322 at [44] and at [68]-[71]. A ground which involves a mixed question of fact and law is not on a question of law alone: see Williams v The Queen [1986] HCA 88; 161 CLR 278 at 287 (Gibbs CJ, Wilson and Dawson JJ agreeing) and 301-302 (Mason and Brennan JJ). 
     
      
    11 As will be seen below, none of the grounds relied upon in relation to the appeal against conviction involved questions of law alone. Each was concerned with an alleged deficiency in the summing-up of the trial judge to the jury, being a particular exercise of a judicial function in the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    12 Upon this issue being raised with senior counsel for the appellant, he applied orally for leave to appeal with respect to the convictions, senior counsel for the Director neither opposing that course, nor the substance of the application. As will be seen, there are issues of substance raised in relation to the summing-up, as identified in the grounds of appeal and it is, accordingly, appropriate to grant leave to appeal in relation to the convictions. 
     
      
    13 The sentencing exercise in the present case involved the inter-relationship of the obligation, in particular circumstances, to set the standard non-parole period and the power to vary the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence, upon a finding of special circumstances under s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. It is, accordingly, also appropriate to grant leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    Appeal against the convictions14 The appellant relied upon two grounds. The first ground alleged that his Honour’s summing-up lacked balance and was unfair. The second ground identified three specific errors in his Honour’s directions to the jury which, it was contended, were not adequately corrected when drawn to his Honour’s attention. 
     
      
    15 The first ground, and in part the second ground, gave rise to questions as to whether objection had been taken at the trial or whether the grounds required leave of the Court to be raised on appeal, pursuant to the Criminal Appeal Rules, r 4.  
     
      
    16 Ground 1 required an assessment to be made of the summing-up as a whole; ground 2 required attention to specific errors which, at least in two cases, were the subject of redirection. It is convenient to deal first with the specific errors, before addressing the overall effect of the summing-up. 
     
      
    (a) Reference to the accused as a drug dealer17 The trial judge summed up the case to the jury on 1 August 2006. In accordance with routine practice, he commenced by explaining a number of general matters to the jury, including his functions and their functions in the trial. He explained that they must view the evidentiary material “coldly, clinically and dispassionately” and without emotion: at pp 6-7. In that context, he directed them to put to one side prejudicial matters of which they had become aware in the course of the evidence, including the fact that the accused was a drug user. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “You must put aside the fact that he is a drug user and you must put aside what you think about drug users. Also, he said in the course of his being interviewed that he had dealt in drugs. You must put that aside. You must put aside what you may think of people who deal in drugs.” 
        
       
      
    18 This was an unfortunate statement: there was no evidence before the jury of any admission by the accused in relation to drug dealing. In seeking to minimise the prejudicial effect of irrelevant matters known to the jury, his Honour revealed prejudicial material of which they were not, at least directly, aware.  
     
      
    19 This was one of two errors raised by the prosecutor in the absence of the jury (Tcpt, p 34). It was common ground between counsel that the accused had made no such admission in the evidence, although his trial counsel suggested that it may be “in the unedited version” of the recorded interview (“the ERISP”): Tcpt, p 35. The trial judge indicated that he would retract the statement, but counsel for the accused made an immediate application for discharge of the jury on the basis that there were matters which could not be rectified, presumably including those which had been raised by the prosecutor. That application was rejected and upon the return of the jury the trial judge made a correction (Tcpt, p 38): 
     
      
       
        
        “Firstly, I said, in reference to the accused’s [sic] and his use of drugs that he had admitted dealing in drugs, I was incorrect in making that reference. I misunderstood the evidence. You must disregard what I have said about that.” 
        
       
      
    20 The application for discharge was a sufficient indication of objection to his Honour’s indication that he would “rectify” the error. Rule 4 was thus not engaged. Given that the nature of the error was to place before the jury prejudicial material which was not in evidence, the appellant’s complaint that some stronger direction was required to rectify the situation has force. 
     
      
    21 The appellant contended that the jury should have been told in unequivocal terms that there was no evidence of any admission of drug dealing, rather than that the trial judge had “misunderstood” the evidence. In the circumstances, it was open to the jury, the appellant argued, to infer that the trial judge had material which was not available to them. The further direction should have sought to address that inference. Finally, given that the context of the revelation was an attempt to ensure that the jury put prejudicial material to one side, it would have been desirable if that instruction had been repeated in the course of the correction. 
     
      
    22 Although the correction was in the respects noted inadequate, there was, nevertheless, a correction of the error. The factual error was itself not critical to the trial and, taken in isolation, could not be said to have caused a miscarriage. Whether it did so cumulatively with other errors, is a matter to which it will be necessary to return. 
     
      
    (b) Knowledge of the blue vibrator23 The appellant complained separately of two aspects of the summing-up with respect to what was variously described as a “dildo” and as the “blue vibrator”. It is convenient to deal with these complaints together. 
     
      
    24 The existence of the blue vibrator was a matter of some importance as evidence potentially confirmatory of the complainant’s account of events. In the first interview with the complainant, conducted at Orange Base Hospital at 12.50am on the night following the afternoon on which the assaults took place, the complainant gave evidence of the appellant putting the vibrator up her bottom. She described it as a “purple man kind of thing and it looked like a dick, and had … a sharp bit there, like that coming out of it to stop it from going right in, and it was, like, round”: Tcpt of interview, answer to Q113. 
     
      
    25 As explained in evidence by Sergeant Nicole Bruce, police executed a search, under warrant, at the Gaskill Street premises at about 8am the next morning: Tcpt, 26/07/06, pp 47-48. Following the search, Sergeant Bruce spoke to Ms Joanne Conroy, the occupier of the premises, by telephone. (The appellant had been staying at the premises while Ms Conroy was away, with the latter’s permission.) Sergeant Bruce then recovered from the front of a square cane basket, a dark blue vibrator which was described as having been “shoved down the front edge of the basket”: Tcpt, p 49. In cross-examination she agreed that Ms Conroy had told her that that was where “she usually keeps the vibrators”: Tcpt, p 51. 
     
      
    26 The police had discovered, on the initial search, what was described as a flesh-coloured dildo near the bed, in a plastic shopping bag: Tcpt, 27/07/05, p 75 (Sergeant Clarke). 
     
      
    27 Both devices were tested for identifiable DNA and the results were given in evidence by Ms Sharon Neville, a forensic biologist. She gave evidence that there was DNA on the flesh-coloured dildo attributable to Ms Conroy and the appellant. It would have been difficult for the appellant to have satisfactorily denied knowledge of the existence of the flesh-coloured dildo, not only because it was found in a plastic bag on the floor, but because of the DNA connection. However, the flesh-coloured dildo was not the subject of any charge and the picture of it taken by the officers conducting the search was apparently not originally included in the relevant exhibit. 
     
      
    28 DNA tests were also carried out on material recovered from the blue vibrator. Ms Neville gave the following evidence as to the results of her examination (Tcpt, 28/07/06, p 103): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You conducted an examination in relation to the blue vibrator and you determined there were at least three contributors of DNA to that, however because of the mixture it was too complex for you to interpret? 
         
        A. Yes. Due to the large number of contributors to that mixture it was too complex.” 
        
       
      
    29 During the evidence of Detective Senior Constable McKechnie a videotape of the search undertaken in the early hours of 21 August was played to the jury (Ex K; Tcpt 26/07/06, p 39). The tape recorded a conversation with the appellant which occurred during the search. The police, knowing of the allegations of the complainant, asked the appellant whether he knew of a vibrator. The appellant replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “No, not that I know of. Jo may have one, but I’m not going to go looking for it.” 
        
       
       
      He was also asked whether he had seen one and replied “No”. 
       
      
    30 As explained by the prosecutor to the jury there were two separate occasions on which he was asked whether there was a vibrator and on the first he said, “I wouldn’t know”: Tcpt, 31/07/06, p 128. The prosecutor then referred to the finding of the flesh-coloured vibrator with the appellant’s DNA on it and to Ms Conroy’s evidence as to where the two items might be located and that, according to her, they were both in the basket. The prosecutor continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “So the accused’s denied any knowledge of it and yet his DNA is found on it. Now that’s something that also corroborates what [the complainant] has told us. So he did have it. He did get it out of there and he placed it in that bag with the black wool … He was asked, ‘Is there a vibrator here?’ ‘Not that I know of. Jo might have one but I’m not looking for it.’” 
        
       
      
    31 In discussing the evidence of Ms Neville, the forensic biologist, his Honour said to the jury (Tcpt, 01/08/06, p 32): 
     
      
       
        
        “The flesh-coloured dildo was examined and found to have the DNA profile of at least two people. The DNA profiles were that of the accused, said to be the major contributor, and that of the owner Miss Conroy, said to be the minor contributor. The accused said that he did not know anything about a dildo, a vibrator, being in the premises. Yet his DNA profile was found on the flesh-coloured dildo. The learned Crown Prosecutor said that you would bear that in mind when you consider the accused’s denials when interviewed by police.” 
        
       
      
    32 Both the comment by the prosecutor in his address and the extract from the summing-up were capable of confusing and misleading. It is possible that the denial of knowledge of a vibrator was a lie, but it was a statement made at a time when the police did not know there were two objects of a similar kind, and when the terms “dildo” and “vibrator” had not attained the points of reference which appear to have arisen during the trial, namely that there was a “flesh-coloured dildo” and a “blue vibrator”. 
     
      
    33 Further, there was some difficulty in the suggestion by the prosecutor that the finding of DNA on the flesh-coloured dildo corroborated the complainant, it being no part of the prosecution case that that item had been used in the course of criminal activity. At the very least, there would have been merit in a clarification of the reasoning process, addressing the manner in which a false denial could properly be used. In the circumstances in which it occurred, it did not necessarily or directly demonstrate a guilty mind as to matters which had been the subject of complaint: see discussion in Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; 178 CLR 193. His Honour’s statement, in effect affirming the logic of the prosecutor’s submission, did nothing to ameliorate the risk of confusion. 
     
      
    34 Despite the potential for confusion, the direction discussed above does not demonstrate a real basis for finding a miscarriage of justice. That the complainant accurately described a specific vibrator, which was in the room, was far more powerful evidence in favour of the accuracy of her complaint than a denial by the appellant of the existence of a vibrator when there were two, one of which (though not that used in the offence) was clearly linked with the appellant and was lying on a bag on the floor beside the bed. To undermine the complaint in this respect, it was necessary to raise the possibility that the complainant had means of knowledge of the existence and appearance of the vibrator, independently of any alleged offence committed on her with it: see [54] below. 
     
      
    35 In respect of this ground, there is an additional problem in that it was not clearly the subject of any objection and hence required leave in order to be pursued. Matters which are not necessarily inaccurate, but merely confusing fall squarely within the area calling for strategic judgment on the part of trial counsel. It was a situation in which closer attention (by way of a further direction) to the way in which the denial could have been used against the appellant, combined with an assessment of the limited damage done by the confusing statements, may not have been thought to be in the appellant’s interests. 
     
      
    (c) Absence of DNA analysis with respect to blue vibrator36 Immediately following the passage in the summing-up discussed above, the trial judge addressed the analysis of DNA found on the blue vibrator. He summarised the evidence in the following manner (Tcpt, 01/08/06, p 33): 
     
      
       
        
        “Ms Neville found that the DNA recovered from the blue vibrator had at least three DNA profiles and neither Miss Conroy, the complainant or the accused could be excluded as having contributed to the DNA on the blue dildo. That does not mean that they necessarily contributed to the DNA, only that they could not be excluded from contributing to the DNA. In other words the markers in the DNA profile of Miss Conroy, the complainant and the accused matched in some respects with the DNA found on the blue vibrator and could not be excluded as not matching. So it does not mean necessarily that the complainant’s DNA is on the blue dildo, only that it is possible that the complainant’s DNA is on the blue dildo.” 
        
       
      
    37 Very shortly thereafter, the jury was apparently asked to leave at the request of the prosecutor. The trial judge asked for the cause of concern and was told: 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: It’s the evidence … regarding the blue vibrator. Your Honour said that he was one of the major contributors that could not be excluded, that’s not the evidence. It was never led. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: One moment, I didn’t say that – in relation to the blue vibrator I said there are at least three people and neither Joanne Conroy or the complainant of the exclude … 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: That’s not the evidence, this is in relation to the blue vibrator. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes the blue vibrator. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: What the evidence was that there was a mixture of contributors and that because of that mixture it was too difficult to interpret. Nothing further was said in relation to the accused being … 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I thought Ms Neville said that neither could be excluded. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No. I led that from her in those terms as I have said. …” 
        
       
      
    38 Later, Mr Walsh for the accused stated (Tcpt, p 36): 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour, in relation to the DNA your Honour has, as the learned Crown Prosecutor put it, has got it completely wrong, absolutely wrong. There is a report in the file, the Registry file, dated 21 April 2006 which is along the lines of what your Honour told the jury.” 
        
       
      
    39 There was then a debate as to whether it was possible effectively to correct the error, counsel for the appellant saying that it was not. His Honour did provide a correction in the following terms (Tcpt, p 38): 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to the evidence of Miss Neville, I referred to the fact that she said that DNA was recovered from the blue-coloured dildo or vibrator from at least three people and I said that her evidence was that the DNA of Miss Conroy, the complainant and the accused could not be excluded from being on that object. Her evidence was, I am reminded, that, because of the complexity of the DNA recovered from the blue coloured dildo, no one could be identified as having the DNA profile. So I withdraw what I said about Ms Neville’s evidence in relation to the DNA recovered from the blue-coloured dildo.” 
        
       
      
    40 This error on the part of the trial judge is troubling. Factual errors are capable of correction, usually without undue prejudice, because they result from mistakes. Mistakes with respect to matters central to the prosecution or defence case differ from those with respect to matters which are peripheral (albeit prejudicial) as in the first mistake referred to above, relating to drug dealing. With the present error, the language used by the trial judge departed to such a degree from that employed by the witness, in response to a precisely formulated leading question from the prosecutor, that it invited speculation as to how the error could have arisen. Counsel, it appears, had no doubt that it had arisen from his Honour having reference to a second report, which was not in evidence. Indeed, an exchange with the Bench tended to confirm that reasoning: Tcpt, p 36. The appellant’s contention now is that there must be a real risk that the jury inferred that there was other evidence which, for reasons which had not been revealed to them, was not available to them. Such speculation was available because they were not given any reason for such a significant misstatement of the evidence. 
     
      
    41 In written submissions, the Director noted (pars 56-57): 
     
      
       
        
        “These corrections would have been clear to the jury having just heard the summing-up and the errors his Honour had made. His correction was clear and the jury could have been left in no doubt as to what the evidence was and how it could be used. …  
        
       
       
        
        Once the learned trial judge had corrected himself, there was no need for any further direction.” 
        
       
      
    42 This response does not fully answer the gravamen of the complaint. It might have been helpful if there had been further discussion of the difficulty in the course of the trial, but it appears that because of the trial judge’s firm insistence, without reasoned discussion, that the matter could be corrected, together with the absence of any discussion as to the form of the correction, that the real difficulties were not identified. If, as the Director asserted on the appeal, in arguing that the error carried little risk of miscarriage, the evidence actually given by Ms Neville would have been fresh in the jury’s minds during the summing-up, that fact would tend to accentuate the risk that the jury might have speculated as to the source of his Honour’s error. 
     
      
    43 Again, it is desirable to reserve consideration of the effect of the error until the other complaints have been addressed. 
     
      
    Lack of balance in summing-up44 The issue raised by the first ground of appeal in relation to the conviction concerns the requirement for a proper balance to be maintained in the course of the summing-up. That such an obligation exists, as an element of procedural fairness, is not in dispute. However, the nature of the requirement may vary significantly depending on the circumstances of the particular case. As explained in Stokes v The Queen [1960] HCA 95; 105 CLR 279 at 284, by Dixon CJ, Fullagar and Kitto JJ, the trial judge should not sum up in a manner such as ‘“to deprive the jury of an adequate opportunity of understanding and giving effect to the defence and the matters relied upon in support of the defence.” 
     
      
    45 Alternatively, as explained by Brennan J in B v The Queen [1992] HCA 68; 175 CLR 599 at 605-606, in language derived from earlier authorities, there may be “a danger of the jury being overawed by the judge’s views, where, even though the jury are told that the decision on the facts is for them, the language of the judge is so forceful that they may be under the impression that there is really nothing for them to decide or that they would be fatuous or disrespectful if they disagreed with the judge’s views”. 
     
      
    46 The most obvious circumstances in which a summing-up may be unfair is where the trial judge deems it appropriate to comment in a deprecating fashion upon aspects of the defence case. Such conduct may be justifiable, but it risks a demonstration of partiality in relation to matters which are to be determined by the jury alone and not by the judge. 
     
      
    47 In other cases there may be a misrepresentation as to the substance of the defence. In Regina v Tomazos (unrep, NSWCCA, 6 August 1971) a conviction for malicious wounding was set aside where the appellant’s defence, as explained by the trial judge to the jury, was one of self-defence, whereas he had denied involvement in the wounding. 
     
      
    48 The present case gives rise to neither a complaint that the judge usurped the jury’s function, nor to a complaint that the defence case was misrepresented. Rather, the complaint is that it simply was not put, thereby allowing the jury to infer that the trial judge placed no weight upon it. 
     
      
    49 In substance, the defence case had four limbs. The first was that the account told by the complainant included inconsistencies and falsities which demonstrated that the jury could not rely upon her evidence to satisfy them beyond reasonable doubt of her complaints. The second limb was that, once the jury was satisfied that it should seek independent corroboration of her account, there was little by way of independent corroboration which was not capable of alternative explanation. Thirdly, because her account of events expanded upon each retelling, it became impossible to say what if any was the truth, and what was exaggeration or the product of imagination. Fourthly, emphasis was placed upon the absence of any evidence of semen or DNA material from the appellant on the complainant or her clothing and the absence of any of the complainant’s DNA on the blue vibrator. 
     
      
    50 In the course of his Honour’s general explanation to the jury of the criminal process, he sought to explain the elements of the charges and to distinguish them from other factual matters. The elements were to be proved by the prosecution beyond reasonable doubt, but there was no obligation “to, as it were, chase every rabbit down every burrow”: p 16. His Honour gave three examples of factual matters in dispute, as to which a jury might not be able to determine the truth. The first was whether, as the complainant had alleged, the accused locked the door to the unit. Her evidence was that she saw the accused lock the door and hide the key: p 17. On the other hand, both the appellant, in his recorded interview, and the occupant of the premises, Ms Conroy, asserted that the door could not be locked from the inside. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Does that mean that the complainant is lying? Or does it mean the complainant believed that the door was locked but is mistaken in her belief? That is a question that you might ponder long and hard and not answer or resolve.” 
        
       
      
    51 In putting the matter in this way, and not otherwise addressing it, the trial judge failed to identify the significance of this issue for the defence case, as opposed to its irrelevance for the prosecution case. Of course, it was no element of the charge which the prosecution needed to prove, but for the defence, it may have been significant if the complainant could be shown to have either made up this aspect of her story, or imagined that something had happened which could not have happened. 
     
      
    52 Although giving evidence of being a virtual prisoner, held under lock and key, the complainant eventually conceded in cross-examination, inconsistently with the tenor of that evidence, that she had gone to the shops during the course of the afternoon and had visited two friends. Further, she accepted that the appellant had left her alone in the house for a period. 
     
      
    53 There was evidence said to be inconsistent with her allegations of traumatic sexual misconduct in that, when visiting friends with the appellant in the course of the afternoon she had apparently played happily with their dog. Further, before going home, she had accepted the appellant’s offer to make custard for her and had eaten it. Shortly after 5pm, she had called her father by telephone without seeking help or expressing fear of the appellant. 
     
      
    54 The second dispute referred to by his Honour was closer to the core of the prosecution case. Thus, the complainant had given evidence that the blue vibrator in fact vibrated when it had batteries in it, whereas its owner, Ms Conroy, stated that it was broken and would not vibrate: Tcpt, 27/07/06, p 84. This was a not insignificant detail for the defence. The complainant had accepted in her evidence that she had been to Ms Conroy’s premises before. Although she denied the suggestion that she had found the blue vibrator on an earlier occasion, the accuracy of the detailed description of the vibrator and the opportunity to have found it on another occasion could have given rise to some doubt in the minds of the jury in relation to an aspect of the case which would otherwise have been damning to the accused.  
     
      
    55 The third example of a rabbit which did not need to be chased down a burrow was the reason why the accused gave the complainant $10. He said that it was something of a fine payable because she had caught him swearing and that it came from what was known as “the swear jar”. In his interview with police, the appellant said that he had proffered $5 and had capitulated to her demand for $10. 
     
      
    56 That example was more nearly neutral than the other examples. The real complaint was that the trial judge failed to explain to the jury the significance of the first two matters to the defence, as going to establish inaccuracies in the complainant’s account. 
     
      
    57 There were two other matters of some significance in assessing the veracity of the complainant which were not addressed in the summing-up. The first was that, although the complainant alleged penetration of her vagina, the medical evidence did not support that complaint and indeed the erythema of the vulva, although consistent with attempted penetration, may also have resulted from a genital infection, for which the complainant had been treated both shortly before and shortly after the events of 20 August. 
     
      
    58 Secondly, the first action of the appellant of which she complained was that he “stuck his finger up my bottom”: police interview, Q32 and answer. She later stated that “he kept pushing it up and down” and “[k]ept scratching my bottom and it hurt”: Q95. She also said that it hurt because “his nail stuck into my bottom”: Q88. The defence case noted that, despite this evidence, there was no medical evidence of laceration, tearing, abrasion or bleeding. 
     
      
    59 There is substance in these complaints and, in presenting the case to the jury, it would have been desirable if the trial judge had identified for the jury the potential weaknesses in the prosecution case relied on by the defence. This did not happen. 
     
      
    60 The Director contends that whatever the strength of these complaints, they were not raised with the trial judge and hence there was no opportunity for the trial judge to give further directions in a form requested by the accused. 
     
      
    61 As with the earlier complaint of lack of objection at the trial, this Court must be conscious of the possibility that no further directions were sought at the end of the summing-up for the strategic reason that counsel was content to rely upon the message conveyed by his own address, rather than risk the repetition of the strong points for the defence, possibly in more muted terms, from the trial judge. 
     
      
    62 On the other hand, as counsel for the appellant noted, when the two corrections had been sought by the prosecutor, counsel for the accused had immediately applied for the jury to be discharged: Tcpt, 01/08/06, p 35. He had stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “There are so many matters with respect that your Honour’s said that can’t be rectified and the flavour of what your Honour’s said creates problems.” 
        
       
      
    63 Counsel then complained that the jury had been told at the outset that there was a possibility of a majority verdict, of the error in relation to the DNA evidence and of the confusion said to have arisen as to the accused’s denial during the search with respect to knowledge of the vibrator. What exactly counsel meant by his reference to “the flavour” of what had been said is not entirely clear. 
     
      
    64 No further redirection was sought at the end of the summing-up, although counsel asked his Honour to explain to the jury that in participating in an interview at the police station, he had deliberately elected not to exercise his right to silence and had told his story voluntarily. His Honour concluded (p 50): 
     
      
       
        
        “So, members of the jury, he was told about the rights that he had and he did not exercise them. It is not something to be taken in account in his favour. The Crown relies upon some of the answers that he gave when he was interviewed.” 
        
       
      
    Miscarriage of justice65 The correct approach to assessing the matters of concern raised above is not without difficulty. Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act provides that the Court shall allow the appeal if it falls into one of three categories: see Hargan v The King [1919] HCA 45; 27 CLR 13 at 23. The first is that the verdict is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. That ground is not relied upon in the present case. Secondly, an appeal shall be allowed where there has been a wrong decision on any question of law. That category of error is not relied upon. Thirdly, an appeal shall be allowed if “on any other ground whatsoever” there was a miscarriage of justice. The present case must be considered by reference to the third category. As noted by Gleeson CJ in Nudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; 80 ALJR 614 at [7]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The concept of miscarriage of justice is as wide as the potential for error. Indeed, it is wider; for not all miscarriages involve error.” 
        
       
      
    66 The potential scope of the ground was summarised by Brooking JA in R v Gallagher [1998] 2 VR 671 at 677-678: 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        R v Cutter  
        [1944] 2 All ER 337 at 339 it was said that the words ‘or that on any ground there was a miscarriage of justice’ mean that there has been some irregularity and that it has resulted in a miscarriage of justice. … The dragnet ground covers, in appropriate circumstances, a very wide variety of irregularities, including discovery of fresh evidence, undue interruption by the judge, refusal of an adjournment, tampering with a juror and the disclosure to the jury of prejudicial material (otherwise than by the reception of inadmissible evidence, which is a wrong decision of a question of law). Very early in the application of the legislation it was accepted … that a mistake of the judge as to fact, or the judge’s omission to refer to some point in favour of the prisoner, was not a wrong decision of a point of law but merely came within the dragnet ground, so that the question in such a case was whether there was a miscarriage of justice. … 
        
       
       
        
        Similarly, in  
        McInnis v R 
         (1979) 143 CLR 575, where the trial judge had refused to grant the accused an adjournment, the accused relied, as he had to do, on the third, dragnet, ground.” 
        
       
      
    67 The obligation of the Court to allow the appeal when of the opinion that one of the conditions identified in s 6(1) is satisfied, is not absolute; it is subject to the proviso that the Court may dismiss the appeal if affirmatively satisfied that “no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”. In Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; 224 CLR 300 at [36] the High Court noted that “[b]y hypothesis, when the proviso falls for consideration, the appellate court has decided that there was some irregularity at trial”. However, where the verdict was neither unreasonable nor unsupportable and where there was no error of law in the course of the trial, there is some awkwardness in treating s 6(1) as involving a rigid two-stage process whereby the Court must determine that there has been “a miscarriage of justice”, before considering whether the miscarriage was not substantial. 
     
      
    68 The problem was referred to by McHugh J in TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; 212 CLR 124 at [63] in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “When miscarriage of justice is a ground of appeal, the burden of proof and the nature of the issues determined are different from those issues in a case where the proviso is being considered. Cases on the proviso operate on the hypothesis that there has been a legal error that prima facie requires the conviction to be set aside. The issue then becomes whether the Crown has shown that no substantial miscarriage of justice occurred because the error could not have affected the result of the trial. When the appellant seeks to make miscarriage of justice a ground of appeal, however, he or she has the burden of proving that there has been a miscarriage of justice. But does miscarriage of justice have the same meaning in the miscarriage of justice ground in s 6(1) as it does in the proviso? Is there a difference between a miscarriage of justice and a substantial miscarriage of justice? Does the proviso have any application to a case falling within the miscarriage of justice ground in s 6(1)?” 
        
       
      
    69 The problem of the inter-relationship between the proviso and the various bases upon which a conviction may be set aside exists with respect to each category, but appears to be most acute in respect of the third miscarriage of justice category. That is because there is a degree of artificiality in saying that there has been a miscarriage, in the sense of an irregularity which may have affected the verdict, but saying that it was not a substantial miscarriage. With respect to an error of law in the direction to the jury, it would be surprising if the section required the Court to allow the appeal on such a ground unless the error were material, because it might have affected the outcome; however, that would be sufficient to satisfy the proviso. As noted by McHugh J in the passage set out above from TKWJ, the burden will shift from the appellant, who must establish a ground of appeal, to the prosecution, which must establish that the proviso is engaged. However, to speak about a burden on one party or the other is unlikely to have practical consequences. What the appellant must prove is the error or irregularity; the assessment of that error or irregularity as material or as not giving rise to a substantial miscarriage, is an evaluative judgment about which the Court must reach a view, one way or the other. It is likely to be a relatively rare case in which the Court is unable to reach a view and the burden becomes decisive. As McHugh J stated in TKWJ at [72], “[i]f the appellant must show that the irregularity affected the result, there can be no onus on the prosecution to show that it did not”: at p 72. 
     
      
    70 Where the complaint is based upon a lack of “balance” or fairness in the summing-up, it will often be necessary to evaluate the summing-up as a whole and in the context of the evidence and the addresses of counsel. No different exercise will be required in applying the proviso. Even though it may be possible to identify specific aspects of the defence case which were not adequately put to the jury by the trial judge, there is nevertheless an air of artificiality in adopting a two-stage analysis. Nor does the section appear to require it: it does not envisage that the obligation to allow the appeal must be engaged before the proviso is considered. Rather the power to dismiss the appeal, by applying the proviso, is said to arise if the Court is of opinion that “the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant”. No doubt it is necessary for the Court to be satisfied that there are irregularities which might constitute a miscarriage of justice, and to assess the materiality of those irregularities. The Court is not required, however, to reach a firm conclusion that there has been a miscarriage of justice, before considering whether it is also satisfied that no substantial miscarriage has actually occurred. 
     
      
    71 As was explained in Hannes v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) (No. 2) [2006] NSWCCA 373; 60 ACSR 1; 165 A Crim R 151; 205 FLR 217 at [56], the phrase used in the provision can have two points of reference: first, it may refer to the fairness of the process of a criminal trial; secondly, it may be directed to the soundness of the verdict. The High Court explained in Weiss at [45]: 
     
      
       
        
        “What can be said, however, is that there may be cases where it would be proper to allow the appeal and order a new trial, even though the appellate court was persuaded to the requisite degree of the appellant's guilt. Cases where there has been a significant denial of procedural fairness at trial may provide examples of cases of that kind.” 
        
       
      
    72 Although there were aspects of the trial judge’s summing-up in the present case which revealed inadequacies or irregularities, they were not so material as to amount to a significant denial of procedural fairness. Accordingly, adopting the approach required by Weiss, it is necessary for this Court to decide whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred: Weiss at [35] and [39]-[41]; Gassy v The Queen [2008] HCA 18; 82 ALJR 838 at [18] (Gummow and Hayne JJ); [60]-[61] (Kirby J). 
     
      
    73 In order to undertake that assessment, it is helpful to identify the manner in which the jury discriminated between the counts on which it convicted the appellant and those on which it acquitted him. First, the jury rejected those counts which involved genital penetration going beyond the vulva, but did accept count 4, dealing with penile penetration of the vulva itself. This discrimination suggests that the jury was not prepared to rely upon the complainant’s evidence alone, unsupported by corroboration. The jury was not prepared to accept her complaint of vaginal penetration, which was not supported by medical testimony. On the other hand, it was prepared to accept her complaint of vulval penetration and did not accept the suggestion that the erythema of the vulva was, contrary to the primary position of the examining doctor, a result of infection rather than assault. Further, the jury was not persuaded beyond reasonable doubt of oral penetration or that the appellant took the complainant’s hand and placed it on his penis. These were matters which had no element of corroboration; they only surfaced in the complainant’s second police interview. 
     
      
    74 The elements of the story which the jury accepted were recounted by the complainant to her father on arriving home (a complaint of anal digital penetration) and to her next door neighbour, Ms Jones, immediately thereafter (both digital and penile anal penetration, together with reference to self-injection with drugs, watching a pornographic movie and ejaculating over the pillow). 
     
      
    75 There were two elements of her story which were objectively corroborated by material obtained on search of the premises. The first was the identification of semen on the appellant’s pillow. That could, of course, have resulted from sexual activity having nothing to do with the complainant, but there was no plausible explanation as to why, in that event, the complainant would have known of it. This constituted persuasive objective evidence supportive of sexual activity involving the complainant. 
     
      
    76 Secondly, there was her description of the blue vibrator, which was indisputably accurate. If she had not seen it in the course of sexual activity on the afternoon in question, as she claimed, she must have seen it on a different occasion. While it was established that the complainant had been to Ms Conroy’s premises on more than one occasion, the complainant had not slept in her bedroom and Ms Conroy was adamant that she did not leave the vibrator lying around the bedroom: Tcpt, 27/07/06, pp 87-88. In re-examination she was asked whether she had shown the complainant the vibrators and answered: “Absolutely not”: Tcpt, p 88. 
     
      
    77 The possibility that the complainant had seen the blue vibrator on some other occasion rose no higher than speculation, and speculation which she denied. The blue vibrator was not clearly visible in the bedroom and was not found by police on the first search, although they asked the appellant about a vibrator on three occasions. His denial of knowledge of a vibrator was at least inconsistent with the possibility that the vibrator had been clearly visible and might have been seen by the complainant on the previous afternoon. In fact, the objective evidence was persuasive and supportive of the view that there had been sexual activity on the previous afternoon involving the complainant and involving a blue vibrator. 
     
      
    78 Further, the evidence given by Dr Mulcahy, of erythema around the anus, on examination of the complainant at Orange Base Hospital on the following morning, was described by him as “consistent with her history of digital penile and penetration by a vibrator”: Tcpt, 26/07/06, p 55. 
     
      
    79 Finally, the fact that the appellant had pornographic videos portraying anal sex was supportive of the complainant’s evidence that he had been watching a “crude video” during the course of the sexual activity which she had described. 
     
      
    80 Other aspects of the complainant’s account were also in conformity with independently established facts. The complainant gave evidence that the accused had injected himself with “speed” in the course of the afternoon. Whilst he admitted that he was a drug user, as indicated by the syringes found by the police on the bedroom floor, he denied injecting in the presence of the complainant. Nevertheless, it was open to the jury to accept the evidence of drug use as providing some support for her description of that part of the events of the afternoon. The defence noted that there was no attempt by the police to identify a recent puncture mark on his left arm, as described by the complainant. On the other hand, there was no evidence to suggest that such an examination would have provided relevant evidence, given his own admission of addiction. 
     
      
    81 The evidence of digital penetration given by the complainant was unequivocal and consistent, from her first complaint to her father on the afternoon in question. The evidence of penetration with a vibrator was supported by the location of the vibrator which she had described. Penile penetration was also consistent with her story from her complaint to Ms Jones on the evening in question. 
     
      
    82 The objective evidence of vulval penetration did not distinguish between possible use of a vibrator and penis. However, there was no description of him using the vibrator in the complainant’s first interview and the discrimination between the two counts appears to be explicable on that basis. 
     
      
    83 It may be seen from this analysis of the evidence that any failure to correct the prejudicial statement about drug dealing is unlikely to have had any significant bearing on the outcome of the case. Similarly, the possible confusion as to the use which might be made of the appellant’s denial during the search of knowing of the presence of a vibrator was unlikely to have been critical in the circumstances, because the use of the vibrator was otherwise supported by the complainant’s description and absence of alternative explanation as to how she could have described the vibrator accurately and in detail. For the same reason, any possible confusion in relation to the DNA analysis of material on the vibrator, was unlikely, as a practical matter, to have affected the jury’s consideration of the counts. So far as the question of balance was concerned, the challenge related to matters of omission, rather than commission. This was not a case in which the trial judge sought to comment on the evidence or spoke deprecatingly or dismissively of the accused’s case: cf Green v The Queen [1971] HCA 55; 126 CLR 28 at 34 (Barwick CJ, McTiernan and Owen JJ). The effect of the omissions was to a significant extent ameliorated by the recent and comprehensive address of counsel for the accused. That the summing-up, taken as a whole, did not demonstrate glaring imbalance may also be inferred from the failure of counsel to take any further objection when the opportunity arose. 
     
      
    84 Accordingly, while it was appropriate to grant leave to appeal to consider the various challenges raised by the appellant, I am affirmatively satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice actually occurred in the present case. The appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
    Appeal against sentence85 As noted above, the appellant was sentenced to a period of imprisonment of 8 years 6 months and an additional term of 4 years 10 months. The sentence term of 13 years 4 months was achieved by adding to the standard non-parole period of 10 years a further period of one-third of 10 years, in accordance with the statutory formula in s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. The appellant’s complaints are two-fold: first, it is contended that his Honour failed to consider relevant factors which might have led him not to apply the standard non-parole period and, secondly, that his Honour failed to give proper weight to the appellant’s mental illness. 
     
      
    Application of standard non-parole period86 Section 54B of the Sentencing Procedure Act relevantly provides : 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        54B Sentencing procedure 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) This section applies when a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for an offence set out in the Table to this Division. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) When determining the sentence for the offence, the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    87 The Sentencing Procedure Act further provides that “the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the Table”: s 54A(2). 
     
      
    88 The obligation to set the standard non-parole in a particular case will operate unless the Court determines there are reasons for setting a different period. In order to identify proper reasons, it is necessary to understand what is conveyed by the concept of a “standard” non-parole period. The standard is said to “represent” the non-parole for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences which fall within the specific class to which the particular standard applies. That, in the present case, is the class of offences identified by reference to s 61J(1) of the Crimes Act. The term “represents” is a curious one in this context. Section 54A(2) does not say that the standard non-parole period is that which “should be” set for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. That the legislature eschewed such language may reflect the fact that a non-parole period is not determined solely by reference to an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence; the exercise also takes into account subjective factors specific to the offender, but not relevant to the seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    89 In R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168, in a passage relied upon by the appellant in the present case, this Court (Spigelman CJ, Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J) held that in relation to an offence for which a standard non-parole period was fixed, the sentencing judge was required to ask and answer the question “are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period?”: at [117]. The Court held that an answer to that question must commence with consideration of the objective seriousness of the offence, in order to conclude whether or not it “falls into the mid range of seriousness for an offence of the relevant kind”: [118(i)]. In considering factors relevant to determining objective seriousness, the Court identified “the relevant circumstances which can be said ‘objectively’ to affect the ‘seriousness’ of the offence” as including matters personal to the offender, such as motivation, mental state, mental illness, intellectual disability and other factors going to moral culpability: at [86]. Such matters were to be distinguished from other factors personal to the offender, which did not have a “causal connection” with the commission of the offence. 
     
      
    90 Section 54A adopts a concept of “the range” of objective seriousness: whether that is the whole range or the range of seriousness with respect to those circumstances which require the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment is not clear, although the latter is probably the correct construction, because s 54B only applies when a court is imposing a sentence of imprisonment. The statutory language does not require the determination of a low range, a middle range and a high range of seriousness: it envisages a single range and an offence in the middle of the range. I do not understand the reference in Way to “the mid range of seriousness” to involve any departure from that statutory language. As a practical matter, it must be accepted that the middle of a range of seriousness is not a precise point, nor is there any paradigm by which it can be identified. This follows almost inevitably from the scope and variety of circumstances which can be relevant to considering seriousness. 
     
      
    91 Nor do I understand the Court’s reference to “objective” facts and matters which may affect the judgment of seriousness as rejecting matters which have a subjective quality in relation to the particular individual. That must follow from the Court’s acceptance that some such factors will be personal to the offender: at [86]. The language of the section rather invokes the concept of an objective assessment of the seriousness of the offence, which, while it may be affected by circumstances personal to the offender or the victim, is not to be judged from the perspective of either. 
     
      
    92 On the approach approved in Way, even if a particular offence does fall within the middle of the range of objective seriousness, it does not follow that the standard non-parole period will be set for that offence. If there are subjective factors relevant to the offender (but not the offence) which militate in favour of a shorter period, those will provide reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period. Those factors must be aggravating or mitigating circumstances identified in s 21A, according to the terms of s 54B(3), but, as the Court noted in Way, s 21A(1) refers not merely to the specific factors identified in sub-s (2) and (3) but to any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence. Accordingly, s 54B requires no departure from the application of s 44, including the determination of whether there are “special circumstances” for the purpose of considering whether to depart from the statutory proportion as between the non-parole period and the balance of the term, as defined by that section: see Way at [108]-[113]. 
     
      
    93 There are puzzling aspects of the approach adopted in Division 1A with respect to standard non-parole periods. For example, was it intended by the Parliament that an assessment of the “objective seriousness of an offence” should take into account each of the conduct in question, other objective factors affecting culpability and the subjective features of the offender? There are two reasons for thinking that Parliament did so intend, although by somewhat inapt language. First, in s 21A, after requiring the court to take into account aggravating factors referred to in sub-s (2), and mitigating factors referred to in sub-s (3), the court is required to take into account “any other objective or subjective factor that affects the relative seriousness of the offence”: s 21A(1)(c). Specified mitigating factors include many factors concerning the offender which would generally be considered as subjective considerations undoubtedly relevant to sentence, but not relevant to defining the seriousness of the offence. Secondly, it would be curious to define a standard non-parole period as that which is to be set for the offence, without allowance for subjective features of the offender, where those subjective features will undoubtedly be relevant in the sentencing process at some stage. 
     
      
    94 On the other hand, that approach would have odd consequences. It would require that the objective seriousness of the offence be determined, at least in part, by reference to subjective features of the offender. Secondly, it would tend to diminish the individualized exercise of sentencing and promote a far more mechanistic approach. This Court held in Way that these (and other considerations) militated against the construction outlined above. The preferred construction requires that, even in circumstances where an offence does fall within the middle range of objective seriousness, factors personal to the offender must still be addressed before determining that the standard non-parole period is appropriate. 
     
      
    95 In the present case, the appellant contended that there were reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period, including the appellant’s significant mental illness and his good prospects for rehabilitation. More generally, he contended that the trial judge had not properly taken into account his mental illness in setting the sentence. 
     
      
    96 The trial judge sentenced the appellant on 23 February 2007. In the course of sentencing, he considered a number of factors identified as aggravating factors in s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, which were relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence. In particular, he referred to the following considerations: 
     
      
       
      (a) there was a degree of planning accompanying the offence, albeit without much sophistication; 
       
       
      (b) although there was no actual violence, there was a threat of violence if the complainant were to reveal what had happened and because she believed she was not able to leave the premises; 
       
       
      (c) the complainant was vulnerable because of her age, being only 10 years and 6 months at the time of the offence; 
       
       
      (d) the offender had assumed responsibility for the complainant while in his care, and 
       
       
      (e) although she suffered no significant physical injury, there was a likelihood that she would suffer an adverse effect upon her sexual and emotional development in her teenage years. 
       
      
    97 It does not appear that his Honour took into account the appellant’s mental illness in considering the objective seriousness of the offence, a matter which will be addressed separately below. 
     
      
    98 His Honour concluded that each offence was in the middle of the range of seriousness and that “the standard non-parole period of 10 years is the appropriate starting point for the sentences, so that the appropriate sentence for each offence is imprisonment for 13 years four months”: Judgment, p 13. It is clear that, in calculating the term of each sentence, his Honour commenced with the standard non-parole period and added one-third to achieve the statutory minimum proportion specified in s 44(2). He concluded that the sentences should be served concurrently. 
     
      
    99 His Honour then considered whether there were “special circumstances” warranting a variation of the statutory proportion. He concluded that the need for treatment for mental illness was not a special circumstance, but that his classification as a “non-association” prisoner would make prison life more onerous and should be considered a special circumstance. It was accommodated by reducing the non-parole period by 18 months, without affecting the term of the sentence. 
     
      
    100 Subject to a question as to whether his Honour properly addressed the question of mental illness in determining the objective seriousness of the offence, there was no challenge to the conclusion that the offences fell within the middle range of objective seriousness. Indeed, there was some lack of clarity as to whether the assessment of mental illness affected that issue, or went rather to of the basis for departure from the standard non-parole period and the assessment of the proper length of the sentence. 
     
      
    101 In The Queen v Verdins [2007] VSCA 182; 16 VR 269 the Victorian Court of Appeal (Maxwell P, Buchanan and Vincent JJA) discussed the different ways in which impaired mental functioning, whether temporary or permanent, may affect the sentencing of an offender. Similar principles have been identified from time to time in this Court: see, eg, R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; Regina v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [21]-[26] (Spigelman CJ, Simpson and Blanch JJ agreeing); R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33]-[35] (Sperling J); Courtney v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 195; 172 A Crim R 371 at [14]-[18] (Basten JA), [57]-[59] (Grove J) and [82]-[86] (Howie J). In substance, these factors operate at one or both of two levels. First, a mental impairment may be relevant to the commission of the offence, by reducing the moral culpability of the offending conduct, and thus the relevance of general deterrence and, if the condition is likely to continue, individual deterrence. Secondly, it may affect the appropriate sentence either because imprisonment may adversely affect the condition, or because the condition may affect the severity of the punishment. 
     
      
    102 In the present case, the severity of the punishment was likely to be affected by an additional factor, namely that the appellant had been, prior to conviction, and was likely in the future to be, subject to a level of isolation because of risks to himself which might eventuate from association with other prisoners. This Court has warned in particular cases against a too ready assumption that a person convicted of offences with young children will necessarily suffer from harsher prison conditions than those applicable more generally. Nevertheless, in the present case there was unchallenged evidence that such a consequence had flowed and was likely to continue, a factor which his Honour took into account in varying the relationship between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence, so as to reduce the non-parole period. There is no challenge to the appropriateness of that step, nor that it properly constituted a finding of “special circumstances” for the purpose of s 44(2). Rather, the appellant seeks to challenge his Honour’s refusal to include in the assessment of special circumstances the effect of his mental illness, which was properly to be taken in combination with his isolation within the prison environment. Further, it was submitted that the onerous conditions of imprisonment should properly have been reflected in a reduction of the term of the sentence and not merely the period of mandatory incarceration. 
     
      
    Evidence of mental illness and circumstances of imprisonment103 The appellant commenced drug use in his later school years, which appear to have complicated his mental health assessment. In 2002 he saw Dr Robert Tym, a psychiatrist in Canberra, who diagnosed him as suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. That diagnosis was confirmed by Dr William E Lucas in 2003. On 18 January 2007, Dr Lucas reported in some detail on his current situation and the circumstances he faced while in prison awaiting trial, having interviewed him in the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre (“the MRRC”) in mid-January 2007. He recounted visual, auditory and olfactory hallucinations. After reviewing the records of Justice Health, Dr Lucas noted that the appellant “has remained psychotic during his imprisonment with some improvement noted during 2006 despite continuing symptoms”: Report, p 10. He noted that he had read a report of Professor David Greenberg querying whether he suffered from a drug-induced psychosis or underlying schizophrenia but noting “the consensus” that he was suffering from chronic paranoid schizophrenia and not a drug-induced psychosis: p 11. 
     
      
    104 Dr Lucas noted that since his trial the appellant had been moved to Bathurst Correctional Centre. Whilst at the MRRC, Long Bay, he had been in the “mental health wing, 16 POD” most of the time, but had not been in the psychiatric wards at Long Bay Hospital. In relation to his period at Bathurst, Dr Lucas stated (Report, p 9): 
     
      
       
        
        “Activity was very limited in Bathurst as he was on non-association and had half an hour a day out of his cell. He was in segregation in the MRRC.” 
        
       
      
    105 In relation to his future, Dr Lucas stated (p 12): 
     
      
       
        
        “His psychiatric management will be difficult in prison. Although he is on medication it is unlikely he will spend a substantial period, if any, in a psychiatric unit and will be classified to a prison where he will be on protection and in segregation probably for the duration [of] his sentence. These circumstances will not be conducive to the psychiatric treatment and rehabilitation he requires. Unfortunately the main effort to provide for his psychiatric and other needs will be after he is released when a lengthy period of supervision in the community will be essential, combined with psychiatric treatment and drug and social rehabilitation.” 
        
       
      
    Error in sentencing106 It is clear that, having determined that the offence fell within the middle range of objective seriousness, the trial judge determined the sentence period by applying the statutory formula for the relationship between the non-parole period and the term of the sentence to the standard non-parole period. There may be a certain logic to that mechanistic approach, if the standard non-parole period is likely to be the non-parole period required to be set. However, once it is accepted that subjective features of the offender may result in the standard period not being set, even though the sole precondition to its operation is satisfied, the justification for that approach is significantly reduced. Further, it means that circumstances relevant to the offender, which do not characterise the seriousness of the offence, will not be addressed in fixing the term of the sentence. Such an approach is inconsistent with the requirement for individualized justice in sentencing, affirmed in Way at, eg, [86], [126] and [127]. 
     
      
    107 That there were relevant factors, subjective to the offender, affecting the term of his non-parole period, suggests that the fixing of the sentence by reference to the standard non-parole period, which was not in fact imposed, was potentially erroneous. That potential was realised because the factors which properly led to a reduction of the standard non-parole period were also relevant to the sentence. 
     
      
    108 Further, a mechanistic approach to determining the term of the sentence by reference to the standard non-parole period is likely to give rise to anomalous results. The standard non-parole periods fixed by the Table to Division 1A demonstrate widely disparate proportions of the maximum penalties for those offences. Yet, Parliament not having varied the maximum penalties, those penalties remain a reference point which must be taken into account in the sentencing process. That the sentences imposed in the present case, for offences in the middle of the range of objective seriousness where there were features of the offender which ultimately were found to warrant departure from the standard non-parole period, should be two-thirds of the maximum penalty, did not necessarily demonstrate error, but should have given the sentencing judge cause to reconsider whether they were appropriate sentences. The mere fact that, in relation to this offence, the standard non-parole period is 50% of the maximum penalty, suggests the need for caution in adoption of the arithmetical process noted above. 
     
      
    109 Although, largely because sentencing is an individualized exercise, statistics are of limited assistance to the sentencing Court, they do, , provide a guide for assessing where a proposed sentence stands in respect of the sentencing profile for that offence. 
     
      
    110 Material before the sentencing judge indicated that over the period from February 2003 to December 2005, 96% of all offenders sentenced under s 61J received sentences of 12 years or less. For non-consecutive terms only, 95% received sentences of 10 years or less. The usual cautions should be borne in mind in having reference to these statistics. In particular, the two categories involve 28 and 20 cases respectively, being relatively small numbers. On the other hand, they provide some broad indication of judicial experience in sentencing for such offences. 
     
      
    111 For the reasons noted by his Honour and recounted above, the offences committed by the appellant were undoubtedly serious. Each offence carried a maximum penalty of 20 years. However, they were committed as part of an on-going course of conduct and were directed to be served concurrently, a course which was not challenged by the Director. 
     
      
    112 There is no doubt that prison conditions are onerous for many members of the community. Imprisonment constitutes punishment, but the punishment should not be the imposition of unduly onerous conditions. If the conditions are likely to be more onerous for one class of prisoner, that should be taken into account on sentencing. It appears that the appellant’s psychotic condition is kept in control by medication. Nevertheless, it is apparent that the combination of isolation, or limited association, together with the evident symptoms of schizophrenia are likely to render a prison environment more onerous for the appellant than for a person to whom either of those conditions applies separately. The fact that his Honour failed to take account of the effect of his mental illness in respect of the circumstances of his imprisonment and the combined effect of his mental illness and his segregation within the prison system, constituted a failure to take account of relevant circumstances.  
     
      
    113 It was as much the need to stabilize the appellant on return to the community in terms of his mental condition, as the removal from onerous conditions of non-association, which justified a longer than usual period on parole. Further, to the extent that each factor rendered his imprisonment more onerous, they should both, separately or in combination, have been taken into account in relation to the setting of the term of imprisonment. Throughout the term of his sentence, even if released into the community, an offender remains liable to be returned to custody, with the consequence that the onerous nature of the custody should be taken into account in relation to the sentence and not merely the non-parole period. This is not taking into account a factor which has been taken into account in reducing an otherwise appropriate “head sentence” with the result that, according to the statutory formula, the non-parole period is reduced, thus rendering it double-counting to reduce the non-parole period further on account of that factor: cf R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at [67] (Spigelman CJ, Mason P, Grove J and Newman AJ agreeing). 
     
      
    114 It appears that the conditions of segregation are likely to continue. In an affidavit filed on 22 August 2008 in these proceedings and available for the purpose of re-sentencing, the appellant stated that he was now at John Morony Correctional Centre at Berkshire Park. He stated that he had been there since he was sentenced. The affidavit continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “I requested that I be kept apart from other prisoners. That was because I was fearful what might happen to me if other prisoners knew why I was in custody. I was a non-association prisoner for fourteen months. Over that time I had a small yard two metres by two metres attached to my cell. I was allowed to be in the yard for six hours a day. I suffer from schizophrenia. Over that time I also became depressed. I have been medicated for my schizophrenia. I receive zyprexol and respirodone. 
        
       
       
        
        I am now a limited association prisoner. This means that I am in a POD with a small number of other prisoners. There are seven of us together. I am the wing sweeper. The other prisoners are also classified as ‘sex offenders’. I am cautious about having too much to do with most of them. 
        
       
       
        
        Because I have been a non-association prisoner and a limited association prisoner there have not been any courses or educational facilities available for me. My part of the prison has a small library. There is, however, nothing to help me educate myself for when I am released.” 
        
       
      
    115 In the circumstances, and taking into account the factors noted above, a sentence of 12 years imprisonment would, in my view, have adequately reflected offences which, according to his Honour’s judgment, fell in the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Maintaining, as the appellant submitted was appropriate, the proportion adopted by the trial judge, a non-parole period of 7 years 8 months should be set, with a further 4 years and 4 months, giving a sentence of 12 years. 
     
      
    Orders116 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Grant leave to appeal in respect of convictions on 4 counts of aggravated sexual assault. 
       
       
      (2) Dismiss the appeal against the convictions. 
       
       
      (3) Grant leave to appeal against the sentences imposed in respect of each count. 
       
       
      (4) Quash the sentences and re-sentence the appellant as follows in respect of each count: 
       
       
        
        (a) Set a non-parole period of 7 years 8 months, with a further period of 4 years 4 months, giving a term of sentence of 12 years. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) Order that each of the sentences be served concurrently. 
         
         
        (c) Direct that each non-parole period commence on 21 August 2005 and expire on 20 April 2013, on which date the appellant is eligible for parole. 
        
       
       
        
        (d) Direct that the further period commence on 21 April 2013 and expire on 20 August 2017. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) The appellant is to be subject to supervision by the New South Wales Parole Service whilst on parole. 
        
       
      
    117 HISLOP J: I agree with Orders 1 and 2 proposed by Basten JA and his Honour’s reasons for those orders. I agree with the orders proposed by Price J as to sentence and with his Honour’s reasons for those orders. 
     
      
    118 PRICE J: I have had the opportunity of reading the draft of the judgment prepared by Basten JA. I agree that the conviction appeal be dismissed. I also agree as Basten JA identifies at [112] that the sentencing Judge failed to take into account the combined effect of the appellant’s mental illness and his segregation within the prison system. This is a matter which might be considered to make the appellant’s prison sentence more onerous than others in the general prison population.  
     
      
    119 Although error has been identified, the question remains whether the Court should form as required by s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 an opinion that “some other sentence … is warranted in law and should have been passed”. As Basten JA recounts at [2] the four offences of which the appellant was convicted by the jury involved three counts of anal penetration and one count of penile penetration of the genitalia. The sentencing Judge determined that the offences were committed as part of an ongoing course of conduct by the appellant and concurrent sentences were imposed consisting of a non-parole period of 8 years 6 months with an additional term of 4 years 10 months. 
     
      
    120 The Crown contended that it was open to His Honour to partially accumulate the sentences for the four offences despite the fact that they occurred as part of the one episode. Given that his Honour determined that all the offences were to be served concurrently, it could not be said, the Crown argued, that the overall result was so severe as to require a reduction in sentence given the principle of totality. No other sentence was warranted in law. I agree with this submission.  
     
      
    121 For his own sexual gratification, the appellant inflicted four different acts of gross indecency on a 10 year old child. Three of those acts involved the penetration of the child’s anus; the first by his finger, the second by his penis and the third by the insertion of the blue-coloured vibrator. Each act by itself occasioned harm to the complainant. The fourth offence concerned penile penetration of the child’s genitalia which involved separate harm to her.  
     
      
    122 The purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 include a recognition of the harm done to the victim and the community. The imposition of totally concurrent sentences, to my mind, fails to acknowledge the separate harm done to the child by the different criminal acts of the appellant. In my view, there are occasions when a sentencing Court should take care to ensure that consideration of an offender’s behaviour being closely related in time does not obscure the fact that different offences were committed. This was, it seems to me, such an occasion. There should have at least been partial accumulation of some of the sentences. Total concurrency of the sentences was generous to the applicant.  
     
      
    123 I am not of the opinion that some other lesser sentence is warranted.  
     
      
    124 I agree with orders (1) and (2) proposed by Basten JA. I, however, propose that leave to appeal against the sentences imposed in respect of each count be granted, but the appeals be dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: 
       
       
      Introduction  
       
      
    1 The proceedings in this matter were originally commenced by way of summons filed on 9 April 2008. On 24 April 2008, an amended summons was filed. Although, on its face, the relief claimed is that for which provision is made in s.69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970, the primary claim was presented as an application for leave to appeal under s.53 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 against the decision of Local Court, his Honour, Magistrate Johnson, the first defendant, given on 11 December 2007. A submitting appearance was filed on behalf of the Magistrate on 17 April 2008.2 Under s.53(3) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, a person against whom an interlocutory order has been made by a Local Court in relation to the person in summary proceedings may appeal to the Supreme Court against the order, but only on a ground that involves a question of law alone, and only by leave of the Supreme Court. 
     
      
    3 An application for leave to appeal must be made within the period prescribed: s.53(4). The period permitted by that provision for an application is 28 days after the making of the decision. The present application has been brought out of time and leave is sought in that respect in circumstances disclosed in the affidavit of the plaintiff’s solicitor, Fouadi Khalil, sworn 20 May 2008. 
     
      
    4 The plaintiff, alternatively, seeks the relief to which I have earlier referred under s.69 of the Supreme Court Act. 
     
      
    5 On the hearing of the proceedings in this Court, the plaintiff was represented by Mr T Gartelmann of counsel. The second defendant, the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) was represented by Mr I Bourke of counsel. Written submissions were lodged by both counsel and these were supplemented at the hearing on 13 October 2008. I record my appreciation to both counsel for their succinct and helpful submissions.6 The decision in question is that of Magistrate Johnson’s refusal to deal with the plaintiff (the defendant in the Local Court) under s.32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990, a provision enabling the diversion of sufferers of specific mental conditions from the criminal law process. In short, the learned Magistrate determined that the plaintiff’s application did not fall within the provisions of s.32 and, accordingly, refused to take action as provided for in s.32(2) or (3).7 The plaintiff has been charged with a large number of offences as set out in the Court Attendance Notices, copies of which constitute Annexure A to the affidavit of Karen Parouchais, solicitor, affirmed on 11 June 2008.8 In summary, the charges are as follows:- 
     
      
       
      • 15 offences under s.178BA of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900 (obtaining a valuable thing by deception). 
       
       
      • 15 offences under s.300(2) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       (use false instrument with intent). 
       
      
    9 The Crown case is that the charges arise out of a series of events alleged to have taken place on the one day, namely, 27 March 2007, at various retail outlets in the Wollongong area. 
     
      
    10 The Crown alleged that on the last-mentioned date, the plaintiff, and two other men, attended various retail outlets and, using fraudulent credit cards, obtained property to the total value of approximately $13,000. 
     
      
      Overview of the local court proceedings culminating in the impugned decision 
      
    11 On 11 September 2007, the plaintiff appeared before the Wollongong Court, the proceedings on that date being listed before his Honour, Magistrate Johnson. Counsel for the plaintiff advised the Court that an application was to be made under s.32 of the abovementioned Act. The matter was then referred to another magistrate who was sitting in the same court complex. 
     
      
    12 Later that same day, the proceedings came before Magistrate Walker for the purposes of hearing the application under s.32. On that occasion, the report of a clinical psychologist, Dr Christopher J Lennings, dated 24 August 2007 was before the Court. The record of proceedings does not indicate that the report was formally tendered and there is no reference in it to the police Statement of Facts having been tendered. 
     
      
    13 According to the transcript, Magistrate Walker expressed a preliminary view (at p.3) that the basis for the application was not, in his opinion, the “normal” type of basis dealt with under s.32 of the Act. Magistrate Walker heard submissions from counsel then appearing for the plaintiff (Mr Ozen of counsel) and from the police prosecutor in relation to the s.32 application. The Magistrate soon after adjourned the proceedings, noting that there was no “treatment plan”. The purpose of the adjournment to another day was to provide the plaintiff with the opportunity of enabling such a plan to commence.  
     
      
    14 Magistrate Walker stated that once the plan had commenced, then the “s.32 application can be considered again” and remarked “I’ve made a note that the treatment plan is to be implemented and we’re to see that it is underway before further consideration”. The proceedings were adjourned until 16 October 2007. I note, at this point, that that was a date when Magistrate Walker was not available as he had been rostered for leave. See, in that respect, Exhibit 2. 
     
      
    15 On 16 October 2007, the proceedings were listed in the Wollongong Local Court before his Honour, Magistrate Andrews. The plaintiff, on that occasion, was represented by his solicitor, Ms Khalil who indicated to the Magistrate that she understood the s.32 application was part heard before Magistrate Walker. Ms Khalil inquired as to whether Magistrate Andrews wished to “deal with it … or adjourn it to allow another magistrate … [to deal with it]”. 
     
      
    16 Magistrate Andrews indicated that, if not inconvenient, he considered that Magistrate Walker should deal with the application. The application was, accordingly, adjourned to 11 December 2007. 
     
      
    17 On 11 December 2007, the proceedings were listed before Magistrate Johnson who took the view that the proceedings were not part heard and that he would proceed to hear the application. The learned Magistrate made it clear that he had, early that morning, listened to the tape of the proceedings in the matter before Magistrate Walker on 11 September 2007. His Honour, on that date, made notes in relation to the matter, a copy of which was tendered in the present proceedings (Exhibit 1). 
     
      
    18 Ms Khalil asked Magistrate Johnson for the proceedings to go before Magistrate Walker but that application was refused. 
     
      
    19 The solicitor for the plaintiff made further submissions, some revisiting her contention that the proceedings were part heard before Magistrate Walker, others directed to the s.32 application.20 It was common ground that Magistrate Johnson had available to him and had read documents relevant to the application under s.32 but there was uncertainty as to whether his Honour had a copy of the police statement of facts. It is evident from the record of proceedings before him that he had read Dr Lennings’ report, which was the primary material relied upon by the plaintiff in support of his application. It may also be inferred that the Magistrate had an appreciation of the matters relied upon by the Crown in relation to the alleged offences, having regard to the details of the alleged offences as set out in each Court Attendance Notice, copies of which were annexed to the affidavit of Ms Karen Parouchais affirmed on 11 June 2008. 
     
      
    21 In his submissions in the proceedings in this Court, Mr Gartelmann advised that his instructing solicitor had informed him of a practice operating at the relevant Court whereby documents in support of an application similar to that made under s.32 were filed at the Local Court and served on the parties in advance of the hearing and that that would appear to be consistent with the fact that the transcript did not disclose the tender of any document either on the day in question or other days.22 The learned Magistrate, as earlier indicated, refused to deal with the plaintiff pursuant to s.32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act. 
     
      
       
      The relief claimed 
       
      
    23 In the amended summons, the relief claimed includes:- 
     
      
       
      (1) An order extending the time for filing the summons for leave to appeal. 
       
       
      (2) An order setting aside the decision of the learned Magistrate made in the Local Court at Wollongong on 11 December 2007 refusing the application made pursuant to s.32 of the  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
      . 
       
       
      (3) A declaration that the jurisdiction of the learned Magistrate had constructively not been exercised for an order that the matter be remitted to the Local Court at Wollongong to be determined according to law. 
       
       
      Grounds 
       
      
    24 The grounds of appeal set out in the amended summons are as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The first defendant erred in law in determining an application under s.32 of the  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
       in circumstances where another Magistrate had part-heard the application. 
       
       
      (2) The first defendant denied the plaintiff procedural fairness in the making of an interlocutory order, namely, the determination of an application pursuant to s.32 of the  
      Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 
      , as the first defendant:- 
       
       
        
        (a) denied the plaintiff adequate opportunity to present evidence in the hearing of the application; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) denied the plaintiff adequate opportunity to make submissions in the hearing of the application; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) demonstrated an apparent pre-judgment of the application; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) demonstrated an apparent bias in hearing the application; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) refused to allow the hearing of the application to continue before the Magistrate who had previously commenced to hear it. 
        
       
       
      The statutory scheme 
       
      
    25 The long title of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act is “an Act with respect to criminal proceedings involving persons affected by mental illness and other mental conditions”. 
     
      
    26 Part 3 of the Act applies to criminal proceedings in respect of summary offences or indictable offences triable summarily, being proceedings before a Magistrate, and includes any related proceedings under the Bail Act 1978, but does not apply to committal proceedings: s.31(1). 
     
      
    27 Section 32, which appears in Part 3 of the Act provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “32.  
        Persons suffering from mental illness or condition 
         
         
        (1) If, at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a Magistrate, it appears to the Magistrate:-  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that the defendant is (or was at the time of the alleged commission of the offence to which the proceedings relate):- 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) developmentally disabled, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) suffering from mental illness, or

            but is not a mentally ill person, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) that, on an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the Magistrate may consider relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law, the Magistrate may take the action set out in subsection (2) or (3). 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Magistrate may do any one or more of the following:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) adjourn the proceedings, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) grant the defendant bail in accordance with the Bail Act 1978, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) make any other order that the Magistrate considers appropriate. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3) The Magistrate may make an order dismissing the charge and discharge the defendant:-  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) into the care of a responsible person, unconditionally or subject to conditions, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) on the condition that the defendant attend on a person or at a place specified by the Magistrate for assessment of the defendant’s mental condition or treatment or both, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (c) unconditionally. 
        
       
       
        
        (3A) If a Magistrate suspects that a defendant subject to an order under subsection (3) may have failed to comply with a condition under that subsection, the Magistrate may, within 6 months of the order being made, call on the defendant to appear before the Magistrate. 
        
       
       
        
        (3B) If the defendant fails to appear, the Magistrate may:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) authorise an authorised officer within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3C) If, however, at the time the Magistrate proposes to call on a defendant referred to in subsection (3A) to appear before the Magistrate, the Magistrate is satisfied that the location of the defendant is unknown, the Magistrate may immediately:-  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) authorise an authorised officer within the meaning of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 to issue a warrant for the defendant’s arrest. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (3D) If a Magistrate discharges a defendant subject to a condition under subsection (3), and the defendant fails to comply with the condition within six months of the discharge, the Magistrate may deal with the charge as if the defendant had not been discharged. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) A decision under this section to dismiss charges against a defendant does not constitute a finding that the charges against the defendant are proven or otherwise. 
        
       
       
        
        (4A) A Magistrate is to state the reasons for making a decision as to whether or not a defendant should be dealt with under subsection (2) or (3). 
        
       
       
        
        (4B) A failure to comply with subsection (4A) does not invalidate any decision of a Magistrate under this section. 
        
       
       
        
        (5) The regulations may prescribe the form of an order under this section.” 
        
       
      
    28 “Mental condition” means “a condition of disability of mind not including either mental illness or developmental disability of mind”: s.3. 
     
      
    29 For the purposes of Part 3, a Magistrate may inform himself or herself as the Magistrate thinks fit, but not so as to require a defendant to incriminate himself or herself: s.36. 
     
      
    30 In Director of Public Prosecutions v El Mawas [2006] NSWCA 154; (2006) 66 NSWLR 93 at [2], Spigelman CJ observed that the structure of s.32(1) turns on whether each of two matters “appears to the Magistrate”, namely:- 
     
      
       
      (1) one of the three facts set out in s.32(1)(a); and 
       
       
      (2) that  
      “it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant” 
       in the manner set out in s.32(1)(b). 
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    31 Before dealing with the submissions put forward by the plaintiff and the second defendant, it is necessary to elaborate upon events attending the hearing on 11 September 2007 before Magistrate Walker and the hearing on 11 December 2007 before Magistrate Johnson 
     
      
    32 On 11 September 2007, Magistrate Walker, as earlier noted, in the submissions of counsel for the plaintiff, raised the point (transcript pp.2 to 3):- 
     
      
       
        
        “Well it hardly seems the basis of the normal type of thing we see in s.32 applications where someone has a real mental illness and they do things because of a mental illness. This is just obtaining money by deception. It seems it would take a pre-determined mental attitude to be able to do it in the first place, it’s not the normal matter that comes within s.32 is it?” 
        
       
      
    33 Following further submissions by counsel for the plaintiff, Magistrate Walker raised the question of a treatment plan:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Now with the treatment plan it sets out things there but there’s nothing been done.” 
        
       
      
    34 Counsel for the plaintiff indicated that his client’s first appointment for “psychotherapy” with a Dr David Luke (a clinical psychologist) had been made for the following Friday. Magistrate Walker then observed (transcript p.3):- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        If I do it 
         under s.32 I’ve got to have a plan that is set out and ready to go.” 
         (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    35 It is clear that, at this early stage, that the Magistrate raised a query as to whether or not the first of the three matters required to be established under s.32(1) existed in the present case (that is, the existence of a “mental condition”). The question of the treatment plan went to the second of those three issues (that “it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant” in the manner set out in s.32(1)(b)) and was raised by him in the context that the treatment plan would only be relevant if he was satisfied of the first matter. At that time, as earlier stated, no treatment plan had, in fact, been implemented. In these circumstances, the matter was, in due course, adjourned, his Honour stating (at transcript pp.5 to 6):- 
     
      
       
        
        “What I intend to do is adjourn the matter to allow that treatment plan to commence and once that’s been done well that s.32 application can be considered again. Now how long do you think you need to get all these things underway?” 
        
       
      
    36 The proceedings were then adjourned on that basis. 
     
      
    37 When the proceedings came before his Honour, Magistrate Johnson on 11 December 2007, his Honour indicated that he had “listened to the transcript” and expressed the view that he did not consider that the proceedings were part-heard. His Honour observed that Magistrate Walker did not say that he was part-heard. He also observed that the Magistrate had not written on the papers that it was part-heard. 
     
      
    38 After some further exchange with the plaintiff’s solicitor, Ms Khalil, the Magistrate stated (transcript, pp.1 to 6):- 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Anyway, let’s get on with this application, do you want to proceed with this application or not? 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Well we wish to proceed but Mr Ozen had all ready  
        [sic] 
         made arguments in relation to s.32 and Magistrate Walker appeared to be satisfied with the limbs but haven’t been satisfied -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: The facts weren’t even tendered to the court, how could you deal with a s.32 and be satisfied without reading the facts. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: They were your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No they’re not. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Your Honour I’d need to go before Magistrate Walker again. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You’re not going before Magistrate Walker again I’m doing it, I’ve read the application, where’s Mr Ozen today? 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Well Mr Ozen didn’t come because there was no reason for him to come because he didn’t have to argue on the 32 any more. All that needed to happen was Magistrate -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOJUR: Mr Walker said he would adjourn the matter for a s.32 application be made to him. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: No he adjourned the matter, if you look on the note it says the treatment plan. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Did you ever listen to the transcript? 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: No. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I did. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Well may I have a copy of the transcript? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I haven’t got a transcript, I listened to the tape. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Well I’d be seeking to listen to that your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well you can make arrangements to do that in the court office if you wish to do that. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Your Honour I have here an updated report. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: This is not a case for a s.32 application, this man does not suffer from a mental illness, this man is not developmentally delayed and this man is not suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital. None of those apply. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: My understanding is Magistrate Walker was satisfied that they did apply. Now he would not have adjourned it and the treatment plan to be instigated -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Don’t interrupt me. I said none of those things apply. There was no evidence that this man is mentally ill, that this man is suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital or this man is developmentally delayed. None of those things apply in Mr Khalil’s case. He does not meet the criteria of s.32. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: I disagree and I also disagree -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I didn’t ask you if you disagree, I said – well is he mentally ill. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: He suffers from a mental condition. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Is he mentally ill? 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: He is not mentally ill, he does not need to be mentally ill. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Stop. Well that’s one of the criteria, he’s not mentally ill. Is he developmentally disabled? 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: No. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Okay so the only criteria you can rely upon is that he suffers from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: That’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Is that what you rely on? 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: The psychologist doesn’t say that, does he. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Well I’d be asking that your Honour read the report again. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’ve read the report, I got in early this morning at half past 7 and I read it and it doesn’t say that. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Well your Honour is there a reason -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’m not going to argue with you, this is not a suitable case. Even if you got over that hurdle, given the nature of the offences this is not an appropriate case to deal with under s.32. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Can I ask your Honour why the matter was adjourned for a treatment plan to be put in place. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You were there were you? 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Yes I was there. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well I wasn’t there you can answer the question, you can answer your own question. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Well because his Honour was satisfied that the two limbs had been met but what he was concerned about -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’m not here to argue with you this is not a section – I’m going to raise my voice and talk over the top of you, this is not a s.32 matter. It will not be dealt with under s.32. One you don’t get over the first hurdle and two if you did this is a most inappropriate case to deal with under s.32. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: To be honest then your Honour -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Are you going to argue with me? Stop -- 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: -- I don’t know why -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Stop, 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL – we’ve been adjourned constantly. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Stop. Don’t argue with me, what pleas are your entering? 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Well I wish to proceed with a s.32 before Magistrate Walker. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Your s.32 application is refused. What pleas are your entering. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: I would suggest that Magistrate Walker is part heard in it and that it goes before -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’ll enter pleas of not guilty for you if you don’t enter pleas. I’ll give you two seconds to enter a plea or I’ll enter them for you and then I’ll set it down for hearing. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Your Honour I must admit you appear to be showing bias in this matter. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: No, no I’ve read it, I’ve read the application and I’ve listened to what Mr Walker said and I’ve listened to the tape. If you want to go and listen to the tape again by all means you do it and then come back again. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Is there a reason you’re not putting it back before Magistrate Walker? 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes indeed. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Considering that Magistrate Andrews wouldn’t deal with it. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Because the court wasted two days because solicitors from your office didn’t make sure that Mr Khalil’s case was resolved before the 6th and 7 December. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: So you’re punishing Mr Khalil because of what solicitors form my office did. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’m not punishing Mr Khalil at all. This is an application without substance without merit whatsoever. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: I would be asking that the matter go -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I’ve wasted enough time on it now, you can get instructions and enter your pleas today, you can go and listen to the tape if you want to. I’m not listening to any more of it. I’ve heard enough now. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: May I be excused.” 
        
       
      
    39 At that point, another matter was interposed. At some later time, the present matter was called on (at transcript, pp.6 to 7):- 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes Ms Khalil. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Your Honour I’d be seeking an adjournment of two to three months to test your decision in relation to the s.32 application and if your Honour’s against me on that I’m not into  
        [sic]  
        a position to enter in any pleas today and we’d be seeking an adjournment into the new year to consider our position. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: You’ve had since March to consider a plea and I did tell your colleagues from your office who were here last week for the other two co-accused to let you know if the s.32 was not successful then you were to enter a plea. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Counsel are not available -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: And you’ve had nine months to consider what pleas should be entered and I would have thought that -- 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: -- to advise 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: -- would be plenty of time. I beg your pardon? 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Counsel are not available to advise the client on a plea and I am not in a position to enter in a plea. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well there are plenty of counsel and plenty of lawyers to advise someone on a matter that is fairly straight forward. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Well your Honour I do not have any instructions on entering a plea and thus cannot enter in a plea -- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Well I did ask your – did your colleagues tell you I wanted a plea entered today? 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Yes my colleagues did indicate that to me. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: 
          
        Okay so what’s been done in the last nine months to enter a plea, I mean there must have been at some stage, some consideration given whether or not if the s.32 is unsuccessful. I mean the s.32 matter didn’t get before Mr Walker until nearly nine months, six months after the event. So there must have been some consideration given to whether there’d be a plea or whether there’d be a 32 application or what we’d do if the 32 was unsuccessful. Someone must have thought about that. 
        
       
       
        
        KHALIL: Well counsel had brought it up with Mr Khalil however given the events that happened on 11 September it wasn’t brought up since then and --”  
        
       
      
    40 There was then further discussion about other matters including the whereabouts of the plaintiff’s counsel and as to what the transcript before the Magistrate had revealed. 
     
      
       
      The plaintiff’s submissions 
       
      
    41 The plaintiff’s written submissions filed on 15 September 2008 set out the history of the application including what is termed the “purported determination of the application”. Reference is also made to the decision of the Court of Appeal in El Mawas (supra) and to the judgment of Howie J in Confos v Director of Public Prosecutions [2004] NSWSC 1159. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – were the proceedings part heard? 
       
      
    42 In relation to Ground 1, it was submitted for the plaintiff that Magistrate Walker had commenced the hearing of the application, had received and considered material in support of it, received submissions of the parties and expressed “at least preliminary views in relation to the questions to be determined in the application” (paragraph 14). 
     
      
    43 It was further submitted that Magistrate Walker should have concluded the hearing of the application, in the absence of some event or circumstance making that impracticable or impossible. Reference was made in that respect to the principles enunciated by Kirby P in Wentworth v Rogers (No 3) (1986) 6 NSWLR 642 at 649. 
     
      
    44 It was submitted for the plaintiff that no occasion had arisen for another judicial officer to conclude a hearing in the circumstances of this case and that Magistrate Johnson had failed to give any reasons for declining to allow the proceedings to be heard before Magistrate Walker. 
     
      
    45 In the circumstances of the case, it was submitted no occasion arose which would warrant a departure from what was described as “the primary rule” whereby proceedings should be completed by the judicial officer who had commenced a hearing of them. 
     
      
    46 Mr Gartelmann, in his oral submissions, sought to support the proposition that the proceedings were part heard by reference to the following matters:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The statement by Magistrate Walker after reference to the absence of a treatment plan  
      “if I do it under s.32 I’ve got to have a plan that is set out and ready to go” 
       (transcript, 11 September 2007, p.3). It was argued that this indicated that his Honour was contemplating hearing the proceedings himself rather than referring them to some other Magistrate. 
       
       
      (2) The reference by Magistrate Walker (pp.5 to 6) that following the treatment plan, the  
      “… s.32 application can be considered again” 
       and that he did not suggest that the application would be heard  
      “afresh or anew or something to that effect” 
       (transcript, 13 October 2008, p.8). Mr Gartelmann submitted that this was consistent, at least, with his Honour being apprised of the matter and having in mind that it would continued before him. 
       
      
    47 Mr Gartelmann submitted that, whilst his Honour stood the matter over to 16 October 2007, a date upon which he would not be available, that could be seen as being consistent with the matter going over for mention on that date. Mr Gartelmann suggested a further interpretation which I need not here detail (transcript, p.8) but he fairly conceded that that interpretation was “somewhat speculative”. I agree with that observation. 
     
      
    48 Mr Bourke, on behalf of the Director of Public Prosecutions, submitted that the actions of Magistrate Walker were inconsistent with him regarding himself as being part heard. In that respect, he relied upon the following facts:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That Magistrate Walker did not mark the bench papers as  
      “part heard” 
      . 
       
       
      (2) That his Honour adjourned the proceedings to a date on which he was not sitting at the Court. 
       
       
      (3) That he adjourned the proceedings to allow the treatment plan to commence and that  
      “… once that’s been done, well that s.32 application can be considered again …” 
      . Mr Bourke also relied upon Magistrate Walker’s statement  
      “… I’ve made a note that the treatment plan is to be implemented and we’re to see that it is underway  
      before further consideration 
      ” 
       (emphasis added). 
       
       
      (4) That the actions of the plaintiff’s solicitor when the proceedings came before Magistrate Andrews on 16 October 2007 were inconsistent with the proceedings being part heard before Magistrate Walker. On that occasion, Ms Khalil stated, inter alia,  
      “I’m not quite sure whether your Honour wants to deal with it or you want to adjourn it to allow Magistrate Walker … [to deal with it]” 
      . 
       
      
    49 Mr Bourke submitted, alternatively, that, even if the proceedings could be regarded as part heard, the plaintiff’s solicitor had waived any entitlement to rely upon that ground. In that respect, it was said that the plaintiff’s solicitor, on 16 October 2007, effectively invited Magistrate Andrews to hear the application and that this amounted to a waiver. It was argued there was a further instance of waiver on 11 December 2007 before Magistrate Johnson. 
     
      
    50 In his oral submissions, Mr Bourke submitted that an important matter in considering whether proceedings should be regarded as being part heard is the question as to what, if any, issues have been considered or determined and regard should be had as to the actual nature of the hearing. 
     
      
    51 In this context, he observed that the proceedings before Magistrate Walker involved no disputed issues of fact, the only issue being what “inferences should be drawn from that report …” (transcript, p.22) referring to the report of Dr Lennings. 
     
      
    52 Finally, Mr Bourke submitted that there had been no explicit requests made by the plaintiff’s solicitor or counsel to Magistrate Walker to treat the matter as a part heard case. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – Denial and procedural fairness? 
       
      
    53 In relation to Ground 2, it was submitted by counsel for the plaintiff that the hearing before Magistrate Johnson failed to meet most, if not all, of the tenents of procedural fairness required of a court. In this respect it was submitted that the plaintiff was denied an adequate opportunity to present his case and attempts made by the solicitor for the plaintiff to refer to material and to make submissions were “overridden” by the Magistrate. 
     
      
    54 It was further submitted that the Magistrate demonstrated an apparent bias in hearing the application and that a reasonable fair-minded observer might reasonably apprehend “… that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide” (paragraph 24).  
     
      
    55 In the written submissions for the plaintiff it was contended:- 
     
      
       
        
        “26. The manner in which Johnson LCM conducted the hearing would have conveyed to the hypothetical observer an apparent pre-judgment of the application. His Honour’s repeated statement that the case was ‘not a case’ for such an application, before giving the parties the opportunity to make submissions as to the issue, manifested that the application had already been determined.” 
        
       
      
    56 In oral submissions, Mr Gartelmann addressed the following matters:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That the reason the Magistrate was resistant to the matter being referred to Magistrate Walker was that he had considered that there had been a waste of time and referring to his Honour’s statement  
      “because the court wasted two days because solicitors from your office didn’t make sure that Mr Khalil’s case was resolved before 6 and 7 December” 
      . This statement referred to the fact that as at 16 October 2007 when the proceedings were listed before Magistrate Andrews, the Court’s attention was not drawn to the fact that cases involving the alleged co-offenders had been listed for hearing on 6 and 7 December 2007. 
       
       
        
        Mr Gartelmann contended that this revealed a pre-occupation by the Magistrate with an extraneous question as to whether the matter was or was not part heard and, more importantly to the s.32 application itself. He submitted that the exchanges about the matter gave rise  
        “… to an unavoidable impression from which a reasonable observer would draw the inference that the learned Magistrate was apparently biased” 
         (transcript, 13 October 2008, p.9). 
        
       
       
        
        I have considered the submissions made on this aspect. I do not consider that the matter was an influencing factor in relation to the questions involved in the first or second grounds of appeal nor do I consider that it reflects any apparent bias. The Magistrate, plainly, was exasperated at the plaintiff’s solicitors for not having drawn to Magistrate Andrew’s attention the listing in relation to the alleged co-offenders and that that had resulted in lost time. Mr Gartelmann fairly conceded that, taken in isolation, this aspect of the matter would not demonstrate perceived bias. I confirm that nothing said on the matter, in my opinion, could support the proposition that it demonstrated any apparent bias in Magistrate Johnson. 
        
       
       
      (2) On the issue of apparent bias and denial of procedural fairness. Mr Gartelmann referred to the transcript of proceedings on 11 December 2007 at pp. 2 to 3 after the Magistrate raised the question  
      “do you want to proceed with this application or not?” 
      . Following reference to additional segments of the transcript that followed the Magistrate’s question, Mr Gartelmann submitted (transcript, 13 October 2008, at pp.11 to 12):- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “The reason I have taken your Honour through that passage is in support of the proposition that the plaintiff was denied adequate opportunity to present his case in support of the application pursuant to s.32. At the outset of that exchange the solicitor then appearing for the plaintiff was, we would submit, quite legitimately concerned still with the appropriateness of his Honour hearing the matter at all, having regard to what had transpired. The learned Magistrate then essentially asked three questions directed to the eligibility of the matter to be dealt with pursuant to s.32, that is, in relation to the jurisdictional question and then purported to refuse the application and that was the extent of the opportunity given to the plaintiff in the purported hearing of the application to present his case.” 
            
          
         
        
       
      
    57 Mr Gartelmann submitted that the exchange between Ms Khalil and Magistrate Johnson to which he drew attention revealed “… an inadequate opportunity for the plaintiff to present his case. His Honour did not allow the plaintiff to refer to the evidence, to make submissions in any meaningful way about the relationship between the evidence and the relevant questions for determination in hearing an application pursuant to s.32 and that is one of the considerations that would tend towards a finding that the plaintiff was denied procedural fairness in the purported hearing of the application” (transcript, 13 October 2008, p.12). 
     
      
    58 In his written submissions, Mr Bourke responded to the two “sub-categories of suggested error”, namely, that “the plaintiff was denied adequate opportunity to present his case” and “Johnson LCM demonstrated apparent bias in hearing the application”. 
     
      
    59 Mr Bourke emphasised, in relation to the first matter, that the plaintiff’s solicitor, when asked by Magistrate Johnson as to whether she wanted to proceed with the application, indicated that she did wish to proceed. Mr Bourke submitted (Outline Submissions for the second defendant (DPP), paragraph 22):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… the solicitor should then have proceeded with the application, by tendering relevant materials, and making submissions. Rather than take that course, the solicitor referred to the history of Mr Ozen having ‘already made arguments in relation to s.32’ and to her (erroneous) belief that ‘Magistrate Walker appeared to be satisfied with the limbs …’” 
        
       
      
    60 Mr Bourke correctly observed that the solicitor had erred in informing Magistrate Johnson that Magistrate Walker had made any determination in relation to the matters under s.32(1)(a) and (b).  
     
      
    61 Mr Bourke further submitted (Outline Submissions for the second defendant):- 
     
      
       
        
        “25. Rather than take up the offer by Magistrate Johnson to present the s.32 application, the Plaintiff’s Solicitor continued largely to repeat the erroneous submission that Magistrate Walker was part-heard, and that (in effect) he had already been satisfied of (some of) the ‘limbs’ of s.32. Although the Solicitor indicated that ‘your Honour I have here an updated report’, there was apparently no attempt to tender the report and make submissions about it.” 
        
       
      
    62 Mr Bourke acknowledged that the proceedings “were not conducted in a model fashion”. Nonetheless, the submission made was that, in fact, the plaintiff’s solicitor was given an adequate opportunity to present the plaintiff’s case but that the opportunity was not acted upon by her in any effective way. 
     
      
    63 In relation to the question of apparent bias, Mr Bourke submitted that it was clear from the transcript that Magistrate Johnson “… took a fairly robust attitude to the appropriateness of applying s.32 to the plaintiff’s circumstances. However, the fact that a judicial officer has formed a preliminary view about an application is, in itself, unexceptional, and does not, without more, amount to apprehended bias or pre-judgment …”. 
     
      
    64 Mr Bourke supported his submission by stating it was not unusual for judges to formulate propositions in order that they be tested and that what a judge says in the course of argument will be merely tentative and exploratory, citing the High Court’s judgment in Regina v Watson; ex parte Armstrong (1976) 136 CLR 248 at 264. 
     
      
    65 He also submitted that, even if it could be said that the Magistrate displayed some impatience or irritation with the application, or with the plaintiff’s solicitor’s presentation of it, it was not at such a level that would justify a finding of actual or apprehended bias. In that respect, he relied upon the observation of Priestley JA in Galea v Galea (1990) 19 NSWLR 263 at 283B. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    66 In relation to Ground 1, a close examination of the transcript of proceedings before Magistrate Walker on 11 September 2007 establishes the following matters. 
     
      
    67 On that occasion, the plaintiff was represented by Mr Ozen of counsel on which occasion Mr Ozen made submissions in relation to what was termed “the first question” which may be taken as a reference to the issue arising under s.32(1)(a)(iii), that is, whether the plaintiff was suffering from “a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital”. 
     
      
    68 After Magistrate Walker expressed doubt as to the basis of the application under s.32 (as set out in paragraph [13]), Mr Ozen made some further submissions about the nature of the suggested medical condition. It was then that Magistrate Walker raised the question of the absence of a treatment plan and that if he did make an order under s.32, he would have to have a plan. There was further discussion on that question and a response by the prosecutor as to the nature of the condition referred to in the psychologist’s report. The prosecutor also addressed on “the second limb” which was a reference to the issue arising in terms of s.32(1)(b), namely, whether “… it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Part than otherwise in accordance with law.” 
     
      
    69 Mr Ozen further addressed on the psychologist’s evidence but not specifically on the issue under s.32(1)(b). The Magistrate then indicated that he intended to “adjourn the matter to allow the treatment plan to commence …”. He added “… once that’s been done, well, that s.32 application can be considered again”. 
     
      
    70 There was then discussion as to an adjourned date. 
     
      
    71 On analysis, the following matters are relevant to the first ground:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The proceedings before Magistrate Walker on 11 September 2007 proceeded for a short time recorded over five pages of transcript. 
       
       
      (2) It became clear that the application was deficient in that there was no available evidence in relation to a treatment plan in the event that the Court was otherwise satisfied as to the plaintiff’s eligibility under s.32 and an opportunity was, accordingly, given to the plaintiff to address that situation by allowing him time to commence the proposed treatment. 
       
       
      (3) I do not attribute the significance suggested in the submissions for the plaintiff to Magistrate Walker’s statement  
      “If I do it under s.32 …” 
      . That is, at least, equally consistent with the possibility that the proceedings may, but would not necessarily, come back before his Honour once the case was ready to proceed after the  
      “plan” 
       was implemented and evidence about the plaintiff’s progress under the plan was available. 
       
       
      (4) The proceedings were, accordingly, adjourned for that purpose without any reference to the matter being treated as part heard and without a request being made for the matter to be marked as part heard. 
       
       
      (5) The date to which the proceedings were adjourned was a date upon which the Magistrate was on leave. This is inconsistent with Magistrate Walker acting on the basis that he was or considered himself to be part heard in the matter. Although it could be said that there is an inference that the proceedings were stood over to 6 October 2007 for mention, the better view is that Magistrate Walker acted on the basis that the proceedings were not part heard before him and would come before another Magistrate on 6 October 2007. 
       
      
    72 I accept, as argued on behalf of the second defendant, that there was some evidence that the plaintiff’s solicitor was prepared to act upon the basis that the proceedings were not part heard when the matter came before Magistrate Andrews on 16 October 2007. Although Ms Khalil at first said that she believed the proceedings were part heard, she then raised the question as to whether Magistrate Andrews would deal with the matter. 
     
      
    73 Whether or not Magistrate Walker could be said to have commenced a hearing on 11 September 2007, the transcript reflects the fact that the Magistrate acted upon the basis that, as the plaintiff did not have the required evidence on a treatment plan, he not having yet embarked upon such a plan, the hearing he had commenced was to be terminated so that the application could then be dealt with, that is, when the proceedings were ready for hearing. 
     
      
    74 Having considered the matters to which I have referred, I am not satisfied that the plaintiff has established that the proceedings were part-heard. A busy Magistrate, if he regarded himself as part heard, would be expected to record on the court record or at least in his or her diary or in the Court roster that the hearing was to be continued part heard before him on a future date. There is no evidence to that effect. Having regard to the matters to which I have referred, I am, accordingly, not satisfied that the plaintiff has made out Ground 1. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    75 In relation to Ground 2, I make the preliminary observation that it is apparent that the proceedings were not conducted by Magistrate Johnson on 11 September 2007 in the orderly manner that one would expect on an application under s.32 of the Act to proceed. In that respect:- 
     
      
       
      (1) There was no process followed involving the tender and marking of documents by way of evidence. 
       
       
      (2) There was no other means of identification employed to record precisely what documents were available to the Magistrate. 
       
       
      (3) The Magistrate did not identify with clarity what documents were and were not before Magistrate Walker on 11 September 2007. 
       
       
      (4) There was no confirmation that the police Statement of Facts was available to the Magistrate. 
       
      
    76 An examination of the transcript, however, also reveals that the plaintiff’s solicitor must also share some responsibility for the way in which the proceedings were conducted. 
     
      
    77 After Magistrate Johnson indicated that he did not consider the proceedings to be part heard, he, as earlier noted, stated “anyway, let’s get on with this application, do you want to proceed with this application or not?”. 
     
      
    78 At that point, it was for Ms Khalil to determine whether or not she wished to apply for an adjournment for a short time or to another date, whether or not she required counsel to appear or otherwise to proceed by focusing upon the issues and make relevant submissions. Her response to the Magistrate’s question was “well we wish to proceed, but Mr Ozen had already made arguments in relation to s.32 and Magistrate Walker appeared to be satisfied with the limbs but haven’t been satisfied --”. 
     
      
    79 In this respect, it is clear:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Ms Khalil indicated that she did wish to proceed with the matter. 
       
       
      (2) She wrongly stated that Magistrate Walker had appeared to have some satisfaction in terms of s.32(1)(a) and (b). 
       
       
      (3) She did not take steps to tender any documentary material such as the statement of facts or any other document. 
       
       
      (4) Ms Khalil did not seek to add anything on the s.32(1)(a) matter to what had already been put forward by Mr Ozen in his submissions and which the Magistrate had access to as part of the information available to him. 
       
       
      (5) Rather than proceed with the issues on the s.32 application, Ms Khalil returned to the question (already determined) of the hearing being conducted by Magistrate Walker stating  
      “your Honour 
        
      I’d need to go before Magistrate Walker again” 
       which drew the response from Magistrate Johnson  
      “you’re not going before Magistrate Walker, I’m doing it, I’ve read the application, where’s Mr Ozen today?” 
      . 
       
      
    80 By the time of this exchange, it was plain that the hearing was not at all proceeding as it should have proceeded. Ms Khalil soon after referred to the fact that she had “an undated report” (p.3) but according to the transcript she made no attempt to tender the report or provide a copy to the Magistrate. It appears, however, from the evidence in the present proceedings that a copy of the report of Dr Luke dated 15 October 2007 had been placed with the Court file on 11 October 2007 (Ms Parouchais stated the report was tendered and “admitted in evidence” on that date). Ms Parouchais’ affidavit affirmed on 12 September 2008 also established that the plaintiff’s affidavit sworn 16 October 2007 had also been filed. It is reasonable to assume that both documents were available to the Magistrate on 11 December 2007. 
     
      
    81 Magistrate Johnson then made the statement that “this is not a case for a s.32 application …”, which in context, as recorded in the transcript, was a reference to the fact that it did not meet the criteria in s.32(1)(a). 
     
      
    82 There then followed a little later a further statement by Magistrate Johnson that he did not consider, given the nature of the offences that it was “an appropriate case to deal with under s.32”. Rather than addressing specifically the issue arising under s.32(1)(b) as to whether or not the facts and circumstances satisfied the second stage required for an application under s.32, Ms Khalil sought to answer what was put to her by simply saying “can I ask your Honour why the matter was adjourned for a treatment plan to be put in place”, the inference here being that the answer to what was put to her by Magistrate Johnson was that Magistrate Walker must be taken to have been satisfied as to both matters under s.32(1)(a) and (b) when, in fact, plainly Magistrate Walker had not expressed any final view on those two matters when the application was before him on 11 September 2007. 
     
      
    83 In the circumstances in which the proceedings were conducted, the question arises as to whether, as contended by Mr Gartelmann of counsel for the plaintiff in his written and oral submissions, the plaintiff was denied an adequate opportunity to present his case, whether attempts by his solicitor to make submissions were “overridden” and whether the manner in which the Magistrate conducted the hearing would have conveyed to the hypothetical observer an apparent pre-judgment of the application (Written Submissions, paragraphs 25 and 26). 
     
      
    84 Before determining the issues raised in relation to Ground 2, it is desirable to consider those issues in the context of the relevant statutory provisions. 
     
      
    85 The legislative framework and the general purpose and policy of s.32 was considered in detail by McColl JA in El Mawas (supra) at [47] to [58]. The provisions of s.32 themselves, together with the analyses of Spigelman CJ and McColl JA in that case, enable a number of propositions to be formulated as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The nature of the powers exercised by a magistrate under the Part 3 jurisdiction are of an inquisitorial or administrative nature and the magistrate may inform himself or herself as he or she things fit: s.36 of the Act, see McColl JA in  
      El Mawas 
       (supra) at [74]. 
       
       
      (2) A defendant may seek to put before a Magistrate who is exercising the jurisdiction under Part 3 of the Act, evidentiary material (eg, medical reports) directed to each of the two matters arising under s.32, namely:- 
       
       
        
        (a) one of the three facts set out in s.32(1)(a); and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) that  
        “it would be appropriate to deal with the defendant” 
         in the manner set out in s.32. 
        
       
       
      (3) A Magistrate exercising the jurisdiction under Part 3 may have regard to any evidentiary material produced on behalf of a defendant on matters relevant to s.32(1)(a) and (b) as well as to  
      “an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the Magistrate may consider relevant …” 
      : s.32(1)(b). 
       
       
      (4) The powers under Part 3 are to be exercised in accordance with procedural fairness requirements:  
      El Mawas 
       (supra) per McColl JA at [74]. 
       
       
      (5) In formulating the judgment for which s.32(1)(b) calls, a proposed course of treatment, including, in particular, the existence and contents of a treatment plan, may be considered and given such weight as the Magistrate considers appropriate in making that judgment: see discussion on this aspect in  
      El Mawas 
       (supra) by Spigelman CJ at [10]. 
       
       
      (6) In addition to receiving evidentiary materials or relevant information, it is necessary that a Magistrate during the course of a hearing in relation to the application of s.32 permit the defendant or his or her legal representative to make submissions relevant to matters arising under or in terms of the two  
      “stages” 
       prescribed by s.32(1) (a) and (b). 
       
       
      (7) In formulating the judgment for which s.32(1)(b) calls, the seriousness of the alleged offence or offences is always a matter that is entitled to be given weight:  
      El Mawas 
       (supra) per Spigelman CJ at [7]. As observed by Howie J on  
      Confos 
       (supra) at [17], the more serious the offending, the more important will be the public interest in punishment being imposed for the protection of the public and the less likely will it be appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of the Act. 
       
      
    86 Returning to the facts of the present matter, it is clear that Magistrate Johnson had access to the following:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The Court file. 
       
       
      (2) The record of the transcript of proceedings before Magistrate Walker on 11 September 2007 which he used to inform himself of the matters raised on the 11 September 2007. There was no objection to him having done so. 
       
       
      (3) The report of Dr Lennings dated 24 August 2007 and, on the basis of Ms Parouchais’ affidavit, the report of Dr Luke. 
       
      
    87 It is apparent from the transcript that Magistrate Johnson had, prior to the hearing, familiarised himself with the submissions that had been made by Mr Ozen of counsel and documents relevant to issues involved in the application including the report of Dr Lennings.  
     
      
    88 No submissions concerning the matter required to be considered under s.32(1)(b) had been made by Mr Ozen or Ms Khalil on 11 September 2007. Mr Ozen may well have decided not to proceed that far, given, as earlier discussed, that the proceedings required an adjournment in order to obtain evidence about a treatment plan, a matter relevant to s.32(1)(b). 
     
      
    89 The specific issues raised in the plaintiff’s submissions, firstly, in relation to the claimed denial of an adequate opportunity to present the plaintiff’s case in relation to the contentions of apparent bias and pre-judgment should, as Mr Gartelmann correctly submitted, be considered together. 
     
      
    90 The transcript of 11 December 2007 confirms, as earlier indicated, that very shortly after he embarked on the hearing of the application, Magistrate Johnson stated “this is not a case for a s.32 application …” (at transcript, p.3) as set out earlier in this judgment. Following an exchange with the plaintiff’s solicitor as to which of the three facts set out in s.32(1)(a) was relied upon, Magistrate Johnson immediately then proceeded to deal with the matter arising under s.32(1)(b) (whether it “would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant”) and expressed his opinion in strong terms (transcript, pp.4 to 5):- 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: I’m not going to argue with you, this is not a suitable case. Even if you got over that hurdle, given the nature of the offences, this is not an appropriate case to deal with under s.32.” 
        
       
      
    91 The latter statement was made by the Magistrate without any submission having been received from the plaintiff’s solicitor and, in the circumstances to which I have earlier referred, none having been made on that aspect earlier by Mr Ozen to Magistrate Walker. It is clear, in my opinion, that, in the circumstances, no proper opportunity was given to the plaintiff’s solicitor to address the issue under s.32(1)(b) before the Magistrate expressed his concluded view about that matter. 
     
      
    92 Whilst the plaintiff’s solicitor did not, either before or after Magistrate Johnson’s last-mentioned statement was made, seek to engage the important issue arising under s.32(1)(b), the Magistrate in moving so swiftly to express his concluded views on the matter under s.32(1)(b), could not, in my opinion, be said to have given the plaintiff’s solicitor the opportunity of dealing with that particular matter before reaching and stating his determination. 
     
      
    93 In those circumstances, I am of the opinion that the plaintiff has established that there was a denial of procedural fairness in that the plaintiff’s solicitor was not afforded an opportunity of making submissions in relation to the matter under s.32(1)(b) before the Magistrate announced his decision in that regard in clear and emphatic terms. 
     
      
    94 The Magistrate’s actual decision can be seen as recorded on p.5 of the transcript of 11 December 2007 in which he stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I’m not here to argue with you this is not a section – I’m going to raise my voice and talk over the top of you, this is not a s.32 matter. It will not be dealt with under s.32. One you don’t get over the first hurdle and two if you did this is a most inappropriate case to deal with under s.32.” 
        
       
      
    95 Insofar as the learned Magistrate’s statement can be said to have evidenced pre-judgment at the point in the proceedings in which it was made, it was not followed by any application to him by the plaintiff’s solicitor to either hear submissions on that matter or to disqualify himself before any formal order was made refusing the application. I will return to the significance of these matters below in relation to the question of leave. 
     
      
    96 A little later after that statement was made, Ms Khalil simply stated, once again, “Well I wish to proceed with a s.32 before Magistrate Walker” which Magistrate Johnson said was refused. Ms Khalil, then again, contended that Magistrate Walker had been part heard, following which Magistrate Walker pressed her to enter a plea on behalf of the plaintiff. It was only then that the question of bias was raised when Ms Khalil stated “your Honour I must admit you appear to be showing bias in this matter”. 
     
      
       
      The question of leave to appeal or exercise of the Court’s discretion 
       
      
    97 A denial of procedural fairness does involve a question of law within the meaning of s.53(3) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act: Australian Broadcasting Tribunal v Bond (1990) 170 CLR 321, 366 to 367 per Deane J. In light of the conclusion I have expressed, namely, that the plaintiff was denied procedural fairness to the extent that the plaintiff’s solicitor was not given an opportunity to make submissions on the matter for consideration under s.32(1)(b) before the Magistrate formed and expressed a firm view on it, the question then is whether or not leave to appeal ought be granted. 
     
      
    98 Alternatively, in terms of the relief of a prerogative nature sought, a similar question arises as to whether or not the discretion should be exercised in favour of granting the relief sought. 
     
      
    99 The grant of leave to appeal under s.53(3), as in the case of the exercise of the discretion, involves the exercise of a broad power or discretion in the Court but one which is to be exercised with regard to accepted principles. Accordingly, the grant of leave may be refused or the discretion declined where a finding of procedural unfairness is made by appropriate regard to matters such as:- 
     
      
       
      • Delay. 
       
       
      • The absence of any operative significance (or the absence of any substantive injustice), arising from a denial of procedural fairness. 
       
       
      • The absence of an application by or on behalf of a defendant to make submissions on a matter under s.32(1). 
       
      
    100 Other general discretionary considerations include:- 
     
      
       
      • The reluctance of courts to interfere with the workings of the criminal courts. 
       
       
      • The availability of appeal processes. 
       
       
      Delay 
       
      
    101 In the present case, I do not consider that delay is a relevant factor operating against the grant of leave or the favourable exercise of the discretion. The circumstances occasioning the delay were fully explained in the affidavit of Ms Khalil sworn 30 May 2008. No submissions were made on this aspect by Mr Bourke on behalf of the second defendant. 
     
      
       
      The significance of the denial of procedural fairness to the outcome 
       
      
    102 In evaluating whether injustice may be said to have been occasioned by the denial of procedural fairness in relation to the discrete aspect identified above, the question is whether the denial of the opportunity to be heard on the issue arising under s.32(1)(b) made a difference to the outcome of the proceedings. That test was stated and applied by Gleeson CJ in Re Refuge Tribunal; ex parte Aala (2000) 204 CLR 82 at [88]. In the same case, Gaudron and Gummow JJ at 116 to 117 adopted the approach that it was sufficient, as was stated by the High Court in Stead v State Government Insurance Commission (1986) 161 CLR 141 at 147 that “the denial of natural justice deprived [the prosecutor] of the possibility of a successful outcome”. See also Bridges v Minister for Immigration & Multicultural Affairs (2001) 114 FCR 456 at [10]; Gibson v Repatriation Commission [2000] FCA 739 and Commissioner of Taxation v La Rosa [2003] FCAFC 125 per Hely J at [84]. 
     
      
    103 It is well-accepted that all a plaintiff need establish is that the denial of natural justice deprived him or her of the possibility of a better outcome. In order to negate that possibility it is necessary for the Court to conclude that a properly conducted adjudication could not possibly have produced a different result: Stead (supra) at 147 and Fifty Property Investments Pty Limited v O’Mara [2006] NSWSC 428 per Brereton J at [53]. 
     
      
    104 As the relevant authorities reveal, the application of that test will very often be difficult to satisfy, especially, for example, where decisions as to credibility are based on erroneous and unfavourable factual assumptions relevant to credibility. 
     
      
    105 Accordingly, it is necessary to take account of the nature of the particular matter that fell for Magistrate Johnson’s determination. The matter under s.32(1)(a) involved a question of fact: El Mawas (supra) per McColl JA at [75] and, as her Honour there stated, it is one properly described as a jurisdictional question. 
     
      
    106 There was both evidence presented (Dr Lennings’ report) and submissions made by Mr Ozen on that jurisdictional question. Bearing in mind the definition of the expression “mental condition” in s.3 of the Act, the question was whether the plaintiff, at the relevant time, “suffered from a mental condition for which treatment is available on a mental health facility”. “Mental condition” is defined in s.3 as “a condition of disability of mind not including either mental illness or developmental disability of mind”. 
     
      
    107 Dr Lennings, in his capacity as a psychologist, there being no evidence available to the learned Magistrate of a medical diagnosis by a medical practitioner, opined that the plaintiff presented with a “mood disorder” which he considered to be “moderately severe” in which symptoms of “depression and comorbid anxiety” occurred. He also concluded that the plaintiff had “some impulse disorder behaviour (his gambling) …”. 
     
      
    108 Dr Lennings did not explain how the plaintiff’s “disorder”, as described, might be considered to fall within the definition of “mental disorder” or a “condition of disability of mind” in the terms defined (see above). The psychologist merely asserted that it was of “sufficient severity to bring him into the criteria as outlined in s.32 of … the Act”. He also stated “His mood disorder was clearly contributory to the offence and in part helps explain his poor judgment”. The substrata for those opinions was not articulated: Makita (Australia) Pty Limited v Sprowles [2001] NSWCA 305; (2001) 52 NSWLR 705. Nor was there any explanation as to how or in what sense the mood disorder was “contributory”. However, in the context of an application under s.32, such deficiencies could only be said to go to the weight to be given by the Magistrate to the opinions, and not to admissibility, the Magistrate being entitled to inform himself as he thinks fit: s.36. 
     
      
    109 Whether or not Dr Lennings’ conclusions in these respects are valid, the plaintiff was not, by reason of the particular breach of procedural fairness which I have determined, deprived of the opportunity of having the evidence that he relied upon, namely, Dr Lennings’ report, placed before the Magistrate nor was he, on the question of his eligibility under s.32(1)(a), deprived of the opportunity of having counsel’s submissions made in relation thereto, these having been placed before Magistrate Walker and noted by Magistrate Johnson who said that he had listened to the tape recording of the proceedings before Magistrate Walker. As earlier noted, there was no objection raised as to Magistrate Johnson’s method of proceeding in relying on information garnered from the hearing conducted on 11 September 2007. 
     
      
    110 In relation to the matter under s.32(1)(b), the Magistrate concluded that “the nature of the offences” meant that “this is not an appropriate case to deal with under s.32” (transcript, p.4), adding, at transcript p.5, that if the plaintiff got over “the first hurdle, this is a most inappropriate case to deal with under s.32”. 
     
      
    111 The question in this case, so far as the plaintiff is concerned, is whether, by not providing his solicitor with the opportunity to make submissions on s.32(1)(b), that “deprived him of the opportunity of the possibility of a successful outcome”: Stead (supra) at 147 in relation to the matter arising under that provision. 
     
      
    112 It is clear that Magistrate Johnson considered that the “nature of the offences” (transcript, p.4) was central in concluding that the case was “not an appropriate case” to be dealt with under s.32. However, it is also important to observe that he also had a clear view that the evidence (which, of course, included Dr Lennings’ report), was not sufficient to satisfy the criteria as to the primary issue of eligibility under s.32(1)(a). That conclusion was reached, as I have observed, having heard the recorded submissions of Mr Ozen made on 11 September 2007 on that aspect and Ms Khalil did not seek to supplement those submissions on 11 December 2007. 
     
      
    113 A Magistrate must be satisfied in relation to both matters under s.32(1)(a) and (b). On the findings I have made, there was no breach of procedural fairness in respect of the Magistrate’s conclusion on the s.32(1)(a) matter. The Magistrate’s determination, which was adverse to the plaintiff on s.32(1)(a), necessarily meant that the application under s.32 could not have succeeded regardless of what the outcome may have been of a properly conducted hearing in relation to s.32(1)(b). 
     
      
    114 It follows that the defect in the hearing in relation to the latter question could not be said to have had any material significance to the outcome of the application. In other words, the breach of procedural fairness to which I have referred in relation to s.32(1)(b) could not be said to have deprived the plaintiff of a successful outcome as the plaintiff did not, on the basis of the Magistrate’s assessment (there having been a proper hearing in relation to eligibility under s.32(1)(a)), meet the specified criteria. 
     
      
       
      Other matters on the issue of leave/discretion 
       
      
    115 By reason of the conclusion that the breach of procedural fairness was not productive of any injustice to the plaintiff, it is unnecessary to consider at any length other matters that could affect the question of the grant of leave/discretion. However, as submissions were made on them, I will briefly set out some observations. 
     
      
    116 I have earlier referred to the fact that no application was made to the learned Magistrate to disqualify himself from continuing in the matter and, in particular, before making an order refusing the application. The relevant principle where there has been a failure to observe the requirements of the appearance of impartial judgment were stated by the High Court in Vakauta v Kelly (1989) 167 CLR 568 at 572, Brennan, Deane and Gaudron JJ. However the specific failure to meet the requirements of procedural fairness in the present case was primarily related to the question of the absence of a proper opportunity to address the Court below on the particular matter arising under s.32(1)(b) and not, on my assessment, one of apparent bias. I do not consider that the abovementioned principle should be applied in the circumstances of this case, particularly having regard to the way in which the proceedings were conducted, as I have earlier outlined. 
     
      
    117 In relation to other matters relevant to the questions of leave and discretion, the proceedings have now been pending in the Local Court for some time. It is clearly desirable for criminal proceedings to be head and determined as soon as possible. Those matters may also be taken into account on the question of the grant of leave or the exercise of discretion in favour of granting relief in this case. In so saying, I am mindful of the fact that the caution exercised by this Court in interfering with current criminal proceedings in other courts is more pronounced where a hearing of proceedings has actually commenced as, for example, was the position in Ayoub v Stapleton [2001] NSWSC 767 per Sperling J. It is unnecessary to express a concluded view on this aspect. 
     
      
    118 In all the circumstances, I do not consider that it is appropriate to grant leave to appeal. Accordingly, leave to appeal is refused. On the same basis, and for the same reasons, I do not consider that the discretion available to the Court should be exercised favourably to the plaintiff in the circumstances outlined in this judgment in relation to relief claimed under s.69 of the Supreme Court Act. I make orders accordingly. 
     
      
    119 I will provide the parties with the opportunity to be heard on any question of costs.

    JUDGMENT AND VERDICTS1 HIS HONOUR: On 8 October 2008 the Accused, William John MURRAY, was arraigned before me on an indictment alleging that he committed 2 offences of resisting a police officer in the execution of the officer’s duty, 2 offences of assaulting a police officer in the execution of the officer’s duty, 1 offence of attempting to use an offensive weapon with intent to prevent the lawful apprehension of himself and 1 offence of escaping from lawful custody.2 He entered pleas of not guilty to each count. A trial then proceeded before me with the Accused having elected to be tried without a jury. I am satisfied that before making that election he sought and received legal advice from an Australian legal practitioner: see s.132 Criminal Procedure Act 1986.3 The task for me is to consider whether the Crown has proved the essential elements of the offences. The Crown bears the onus of proof and the standard of proof is beyond reasonable doubt. The Accused gave evidence in the proceedings but it is important to bear in mind that he did not have to and that he has no onus of proving anything.Overview of the prosecution and defence cases4 Stated briefly, the prosecution case is that two police officers, Plainclothes Senior Constable Owen and Plainclothes Constable Evans sought to arrest the Accused in Chippen Street, Chippendale at about 8pm on 26 January 2007 because they genuinely, although mistakenly, believed that he was in breach of bail conditions. They were purporting to exercise the power of arrest provided in s.50 Bail Act 1978.5 A violent struggle ensued almost immediately the officers informed the Accused that he was under arrest. On the prosecution case it involved the Accused resisting and assaulting both officers. At one point the Accused endeavoured to take the pistol of one of the officers in order to use it to prevent his apprehension. He did not manage to obtain complete control of the pistol, however, and that is why count 5 is charged as an “attempt”. In the end, the Accused managed to break free from the officers and run, hence the charge of escaping from lawful custody.6 It is the prosecution case that such force as was used by the police officers in endeavouring to effect the arrest of the Accused did not exceed that which was “reasonably necessary”, and thus, at no stage were they acting beyond the limits of their duty. The defence case is that the officers did exceed what was legitimately necessary in the circumstances. It is the defence case that the officers did not inform the Accused that he was under arrest, let alone the reason why, and that they simply proceeded to manhandle him and assault him. The Accused raised an issue of self defence and it has been contended that this is an issue no matter what my finding is as to whether the police were acting in the execution of their duty. Once raised as an issue it is, of course, necessary for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt either that the Accused did not believe that it was necessary to do what he did to defend himself, or to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his liberty, or that his conduct was not a reasonable response in the circumstances as he perceived them: see s.418 Crimes Act 1900. S.422 provides, relevantly, that self defence is still available in a situation in which the conduct to which the person responds is lawful. I find it difficult to reconcile that provision in s.422 with the provision in s.418 that allows for self defence in a situation where a person is acting in order to prevent the “unlawful deprivation of his or her liberty”. As far as I can see, that would apply only in a situation referred to in s.418(2)(a), where the person is acting “to defend himself or herself or another person”.7 In addition to the provision in s.422, there is authority from the Court of Criminal Appeal that confirms the availability of self defence to a person who is the subject of action taken by a police officer who is acting in the execution of his or her duty: see Crawford v R [2008] NSWCCA 166.Significance of the officers’ “mistake”8 What is the significance, if any, of the officers being mistaken in their belief that the Accused was in breach of his bail conditions and therefore should be arrested?9 S.50(1) Bail Act is, relevantly, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
      (1) Where a police officer believes on reasonable grounds that a person who has been released on bail has, while at liberty on bail, failed to comply with, or is, while at liberty on bail, about to fail to comply with, the person’s bail undertaking or an agreement entered into by the person pursuant to a bail condition:  
       
        
         
        (a) a police officer may arrest the person without warrant and take the person as soon as practicable before a court, … 
        
       
      
    10 The opening words are important. It is the belief of the officer, and whether it is based on “reasonable grounds” that is determinative of whether there is a power of arrest in the circumstances with which the section is concerned. In this case the evidence is that Senior Constable Owen was aware that the Accused was on bail and that it included a condition that imposed some geographical restriction of his movements. He wanted to speak with the Accused to clarify what that condition was and whether there was any breach of it. Whilst he was speaking with the Accused, Constable Evans made an inquiry on the police radio. Amongst other things about the Accused the radio operator told him that there was “a wanted notation for breach of bail condition that was dated 23 January 2007 so that’s current, he is wanted”. Mr Young SC on behalf of the Accused conceded in his closing submissions that this was sufficient for me to conclude that the officers then held a belief on reasonable grounds that the Accused had failed to comply with his bail conditions and they were thus empowered to arrest him pursuant to s.50. That concession, in my view, was appropriate. I am satisfied that at the time they endeavoured to initiate an arrest of the Accused the officers held a genuine belief that he was in breach of his bail and that, given the source of the information and that they were operating in the field, as it were, this belief was based on reasonable grounds.Police acting in the execution of their duty11 Before turning to a more detailed review of the evidence I should say something about the concept of a police officer acting in the execution of his or her duty. It is something that has been interpreted rather broadly. After a review of long standing authority, the Full Court of the Federal Court of Australia said in Director of Public Prosecutions Reference No 1 of 1993; R v K (1993) 118 ALR 596 at 601: 
     
      
      “The effect of all those cases is that a police officer acts in the execution of his duty from the moment he embarks upon a lawful task connected with his functions as a police officer, and continues to act in the execution of that duty for as long as he is engaged in pursuing the task and until it is completed, provided that he does not in the course of the task do anything outside the ambit of his duty so as to cease to be acting therein”.  
      
    The Court further said (at 601): 
     
      
      “Section 64 should not be construed in any narrow or restricted sense, but should be given a broad operation to protect the performance of all police duties, and not just some. The section is general: ‘in the execution of his duty’. That means that the section applies whenever the police officer is doing something which can fairly and reasonably be regarded, given the existing circumstances, as a carrying out of his duty. The generality of the section is further confirmed by the consideration that it attempts to cover a very wide range of possible interferences with the work of the police: assault, resistance, obstruction, or hindrance, or aid incitement or assistance in relation to any of those things. It is not limited to violence of the sort that was in issue in the present case.” 
      
    12 The section 64 referred to was of the Australian Federal Police Force Act 1979 (Cth) which provided an offence of assaulting, resisting, obstructing or hindering a Federal Police officer in the execution of his duty. Barr J held in Director of Public Prosecutions v Gribble [2004] NSWSC 926 at [27] that s. 58 Crimes Act 1900 had similarly broad scope. 13 As I have already mentioned, the Crown contends, and the defence concedes, that the officers were exercising a power of arrest pursuant to s.50 Bail Act. Are there limits or constraints to the exercise of this power?14 The Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 (“LEPRA”) makes provision in s.201 for safeguards in relation to officers exercising powers under that Act. In particular, it provides that in exercising a power of arrest a police officer must provide the person the subject of the power with evidence that the officer is a police officer, the name of the police officer and his/her place of duty, and the reason for the exercise of the power. However s.201(6) provides that the section does not apply to the exercise of a power that is conferred by an Act or regulation specified in Schedule 1 of the Act. The Bail Act is one of the Acts specified in that Schedule. Consequently, it appears to me that the only legislative safeguard that applied to, and limited, the exercise of the power of arrest that the officers were purporting to exercise was that in s.231 of LEPRA. That section provides: 
     
      
       
      “A police officer or other person who exercises a power to arrest another person may use such force as is reasonably necessary to make the arrest or to prevent the escape of the person after arrest.” 
      
    15 That provision, it seems to me, sets the scope and defines the parameters of the “duty” that the officers were performing. If they exceeded the use of “such force as is reasonably necessary to make the arrest” then they were not acting in the execution of their duty and Counts 1 to 4, which include this as an essential element the Crown must prove, would fail. If I was to find in the Accused’s favour on this point (meaning, if I have a reasonable doubt about whether the officers were acting in the execution of their duty), it would mean that I would have a doubt about whether there was a “lawful apprehension” that was sought to be prevented which is an essential element for Count 5 and whether the Accused was in lawful custody, which is an essential element for Count 6. Significance of prior incidents16 There was a considerable amount of evidence in the trial concerned other events involving the Accused and local police in December 2006 and early January 2007. I do not propose to review that evidence as its significance is quite limited. It indicated that Redfern police officers had arrested the Accused a number of times and charged him with offences which were not sustained. This included a mistake about the Accused being in breach of bail. It led to the Crown Prosecutor suggesting to the Accused that by Australia Day 2007 he felt he was being harassed or targeted by the police. This evidence is equivocal when it comes to determining what in fact happened on that day. It may mean that the police were more likely to act unfairly in relation to the Accused or it may mean that the Accused was more likely to be uncooperative with the police. It may also mean that it made police more aware of the need for caution in their dealings with the Accused, for example, by indicating that he was a person likely to be aggressive and to attempt to evade arrest. There was quite a deal of dispute between the parties as to the details of these prior incidents. In all of the circumstances I do not find it necessary to make any finding in relation to them. The evidence17 The Crown Prosecutor called 5 witnesses in her case. Senior Constable Owen and Constable Evans, Christopher Bourke and Amelia Chauncy who were two passers by who witnessed some parts of the incident, and Leading Senior Constable Wynn who was involved with Constable Evans in a previous encounter with the Accused. The Accused gave evidence in the defence case. 18 Constable Evans gave evidence that he was performing plain clothes duties with Constable Owen when at about 8pm on Friday 26 January 2007 they observed the Accused alighting from a taxi in Chippen Street near Cleveland Street at Chippendale. He said that Constable Owen informed him that the Accused was on bail with a condition that he not be within the Redfern area. Constable Owen said in his evidence that he was aware the Accused was on bail and that there was a geographical boundary condition but in this case he was not quite sure of the limits that had been set. Both officers were familiar with the Accused, having had past dealings with him themselves and being aware of dealings the Accused had had with other police. Constable Evans said that the Accused looked in their direction and then turned and walked away hastily. Constable Owen reversed the unmarked police vehicle until it was near to the Accused and then stopped, alighted and ran over to him. He said that his intention was to speak with the Accused, obtain his details and conduct a bail check over VKG. When he got to the Accused he said, “G’day mate, Redfern police”. The Accused responded, “Yeah, yeah, I don’t want any trouble, just do your thing”. He then held up both hands and placed them against a nearby wall. Constable Owen said, “We’re not going to search you, we just want to check your bail conditions”. The Accused replied, “I don’t want any trouble. Just do your thing. I’m sweet, bro”. He then squatted with his back to the wall. Constable Owen said, “I know you have run away from police before, do you mind sitting with your bum on the ground”. The Accused complied and sat on the ground. Constable Evans then obtained the Accused’s name, address and date of birth and went to the police car to use the radio.19 The radio transmission was recorded and later transcribed. A transcript is Exhibit D. It includes the radio operator informing Constable Evans: 
     
      
       
      “Has warnings, level of resistance, unarmed resisted control wrestle … Will run from police when placed under arrest. POI decamped from police when in custody on the 18.12.2006 … May become aggressive and question police powers … Will attempt to escape at first opportunity, … very towy of police and may attempt to run.” 
      
    20 There are then references to other matters and events recorded on the police computer and then,  
     
      
       
      “the last being a wanted notation for breach of bail condition that was dated 23rd January 2007, so that’s current, he is wanted”.  
      
    21 Constable Evans asked for a caged truck to attend and he was told one would be there in 2 minutes. 22 Constable Evans said that this information heightened his awareness in relation to the Accused. He intended to arrest him but he said he knew he would have to effect that arrest through communication so that it did not escalate because of the Accused’s previous “adverse contact with police”. He returned to the Accused and Constable Owen, produced his police identification and said, “William, you’re under arrest for breaching your bail, but before I caution you I’m going to handcuff you as I know you’ve run away from police in the past”. He explained that he decided to proceed in that way because of the Accused’s demeanour in that he appeared to be on edge, nervous and agitated and his actions seemed a little illogical. He wanted to ensure the safety of both officers and ensure that the Accused did not run away and could be brought before the courts for breaching his bail. He was wanting to control the Accused and minimise violence by handcuffing him. 23 At this point, however, the officers said that the Accused jumped to his feet. Constable Owen took a step towards him and said, “You’re under arrest, William. Turn around and face the wall”. The Accused’s hands were raised in the air at shoulder height and he said, “I’m turning”. As he said this he proceeded to walk sideways. Constable Evans said, “You’re under arrest. Turn around and face the wall so we can handcuff you”. He described the Accused’s demeanour at this point as “very edgy, fidgety, nervous”. He said the Accused did not say anything apart from, “I’m turning”. In other words, there was nothing said by the Accused in relation to the allegation of him being in breach of his bail conditions. 24 The Accused continued to walk away and at that time Constable Owen took hold of his right upper arm. The Accused then began to flail his arms about and walk towards the roadway. His fists were clenched. Constable Evans said, “You’re under arrest. Stop resisting and get on the ground”. Constable Evans then attempted to take hold of one of the Accused’s arms but had difficulty in doing so because of the way the Accused was swinging his arms about. He eventually took hold of the Accused’s left arm with both hands, dropping his portable radio in the process. The Accused pulled free of both officers. They each formed the opinion that he was trying to prevent the arrest and get away. 25 A struggle between the Accused and both officers ensued. Constable Owen was trying to hold on to the Accused but he continued to swing his arms with clenched fists, striking Constable Owen a number of times. He pulled himself out of his T-shirt which Constable Owen was left holding. Constable Evans took hold of his upper body in an attempt to force him to the ground. Both officers were yelling at the Accused to get on the ground. The Accused was punching Constable Evans’ arms and back. The struggle continued with both officers trying to get the Accused to the ground. Constable Evans said he was struggling to hold on to the Accused and felt he was being overpowered. As he was holding on to the Accused, still roughly face on to him, he said he felt the Accused felling around his appointments belt in the area of his capsicum spray canister, handcuffs and baton which were on the left side of the belt. He said he saw the Accused attempting to take out the spray canister. The Accused managed to unclip the pouches that contained the spray canister, handcuffs and baton. He yelled at the Accused, “Don’t take them out”. The Accused did not desist and Constable Evans yelled to Constable Owen, “He’s trying to take out my spray”. Constable Owen said that from the position he was in, he could not see what was happening in the vicinity of Constable Evans’ capsicum spray pouch. 26 Constable Evans said that at this point he was concerned that he and his partner did not have control and that the Accused was stronger than them. He was concerned about the Accused obtaining the spray canister so he punched him twice to the head which appeared to stun the Accused. Constable Owen also punched the Accused who went down but immediately stood back up and the struggle continued. Constable Evans again took hold of his upper torso. At this point Constable Owen yelled out to some bystanders, “We’re police, call triple 0” and Constable Evans yelled, “We’re New South Wales police, help us”. No-one, to their knowledge, responded. Constable Owen said that he had never before felt the need to call upon civilians to assist in relation to this type of incident but in this case he felt it necessary because, “we were out-muscled, he was quite stronger than I was and quite stronger than … Constable Evans. My force that I was applying to get him on the ground was being resisted I think quite easily”He said the punches that had been delivered to the Accused appeared to have no effect on him.27 The struggle continued with the three moving around on the roadway. The Accused continued thrashing his body and arms from side to side. Constable Owen again called out to the bystanders, “We’re police, pick up our radios and call for help”. 28 Constable Evans had the Accused in a headlock with his left arm around the back of his head, attempting to pull him to the ground. Constable Owen then obtained his capsicum spray canister and delivered a short burst into the Accused’s face. Some of the spray went on Constable Evans’ arms. The spray had no apparent effect on the Accused who continued punching at the two constables. 29 Constable Owen took hold of the Accused’s torso from behind. At this point Constable Evans said he felt the restraining strap on his firearm holster on his right hip being pushed down and forward. He looked down towards his gun, a Glock pistol loaded with 15 rounds of deadly hollow point ammunition, and saw the Accused’s hand around the handle. I will quote Constable Evans’ evidence at this point: 
     
      
       
      “And then the next thing when I looked down the firearm was out of my holster. It was - I remember seeing the gap between the nozzle, if I could describe it that way, of my holster - the nozzle of my firearm and my holster, there was a distinct I’d say couple of inches in space, I could see through that. The way my holster sits, and I’d be happy to show you, it sits quite high. The holster is raised and the gun was under my pectoral muscle pointing towards my stomach and my leg. His hand since he’s leaning forward is towards me, his left hand is towards me. It’s over the firearm. His finger was around the trigger guard. I saw his finger around the trigger guard.  
       
       
      The gun’s towards my stomach, in the direction of my stomach or leg and I thought it’s only a matter of time that he’s going to pull that, that’s what I thought. His finger’s on the trigger guard, he’s going to slip onto the trigger or he’s going to figure out where the trigger is. You only need 3 kilograms of force to let that go. That hollow point bullet is going to go straight on the artery in my leg, there I am, I’m dead. Or it’s going to go through my stomach. If I’m lucky to survive I’m going to have life long injuries and serious problems. From that point I had panic. I thought I was dead or pretty much as good as dead. I put my hand on top of the gun and as we’re trained to do, we train for this repeatedly at the academy and we do get this trained in our yearly reviews, so I put my hand on top of his. I remember putting my other arm around his head, I don’t know how I did it but I remember putting both my arms across because that’s all I could think about. And I tried to move it to the side and move my body out to direct the gun so if it did shoot it would shoot into the ground and not on me. The members of the public were still around there. Obviously that was a secondary thought going through my head but I just wanted to get this gun in my holster. I just began to yell out the words,  
      “Gun, gun, gun, gun” 
      , and that’s what we’re trained to do. It notifies the public that there’s a gun, get out of there and notifies your offsider that someone has a gun or they’ve got your gun. 
       
       
      I’ve tried to put it in the holster and he was strong, like, I was struggling to put it there. It did feel like forever. I was trying to put it down in there. I yelled out to Brad,  
      “He’s got my gun.” 
       He said,  
      “If he’s got your gun I’ll shoot you.” 
       And then of course I was panicking and I yelled out,  
      “Well, he has got my fucking gun.” 
       Obviously the wrestle was continuing. Brad’s behind him trying to pull him off. During the struggle I’ve managed to get it into the holster. I haven’t got it the whole way down. He’s still got control of the gun and I could feel the force of him pulling it up. And I was thinking, God, this guy’s strong, you’ve got two men trying to wrestle him to the ground, he’s been sprayed, I’ve punched him, he’s pulling this up and I’m just trying to get it down. I’m also moving back, like, trying to twist it away and get the gun and get him away. It was like a tug of war motion. I could feel the force coming up and I’d think, I’m not going to get this down in there. I managed to and then Brad - I remember Brad pulling him back by around the neck and he pulled him away. And I’ve managed to clip the holster back on. 
       
       
      Then Brad’s pulled him to the ground and then a short wrestle happened where he’s on the ground and I’ve clipped my holster back up. … I’ll go back a bit. … When the gun was in there I was continually moving away. I don’t think I said that. With the struggle with him going up and down while I’m trying to keep my gun in my holster. And I was just yelling out,  
      “Gun” 
      . It’s hard to give the amount of time, it’s hard to say. I’m struggling to articulate it but we’ve both pulled him off and managed to re-holster it. I instantly clipped it to secure it. And then I remember him coming back with two hands towards my gun again. I think if it wasn’t for Brad pulling him off I would have struggled to get that back on. He obviously wants my gun. He’s coming back forward like a zombie with two arms directly in front of him, he’s going to get it again. And then I’ve just thought, well, I’m just going to have to defend myself here and then I’ve just started punching him to the face.” (T16-17). 
      
    30 Constable Owen said when Constable Evans called out “Gun” he instinctively looked towards his firearm. He saw that it was up out of the holster with only the hand of the Accused on it. He said it was at least two inches clear of the holster. He said Constable Evans immediately placed at least one of his hands over the top of the Accused’s and at that point he lost sight of the firearm because of the way that Constable Evans twisted his body clockwise so that his right hip moved away from the Accused.31 Constable Evans said that, thinking that he could be killed or seriously injured, it was necessary to increase the level of coercive force to defend himself and to try and make the Accused submit. He punched the Accused to the face. The struggle continued. Constable Owen managed to pull the Accused to the ground but the Accused continued punching. Constable Evans decided at this point to use his extendable baton and he struck the Accused a number of times, aiming for his legs. The Accused continued punching Constable Owen. Constable Evans dropped his baton, realising that it was useless. He then grabbed the Accused and dragged him over to the bonnet of a parked car. He was hoping to hold him there against the bonnet with the hope that the other police who were on the way would arrive soon. However the Accused continued to struggle and resist. Constable Owen picked up his capsicum spray from where he had dropped it on the roadway. He announced that he was going to spray the Accused again. Constable Evans told him to proceed, even though his head was right next to the Accused. Constable Owen delivered another two bursts of spray into the Accused’s face. Constable Evans felt immediate and excruciating pain but it again appeared to have no effect on the Accused. The Accused continued throwing his arms about, striking Constable Evans and managed to extricate himself from his grip. Constable Own said, “Forget it, just let him go”. Constable Evans made one last attempt to take hold of the Accused but failed and said, “Good, because I’ve got nothing left”. He said he was exhausted. His arms and face were burning from the effects of the capsicum spray. Help arrived moments later.32 In relation to the two bursts of capsicum spray having no apparent effect upon the Accused, Constable Evans said, “I’ve seen capsicum spray deployed in the past. I have deployed it on people in the past. It usually has an immediate effect on them, especially when it’s in the face. They usually scream in pain, sometimes they can cry. They get on the ground, they become very submissive and then you can control the situation there and end it and decontaminate them. It had no effect on him. In the past where spray has had no effect on people it’s usually because they’re under an illicit drug like ice where pain compliance is severely minimised.”33 Amelia Chauncy and Christopher Bourke were two of the bystanders who witnessed at least some parts of the incident. They were returning to the Waldorf Apartments in Chippen Street. As they entered Chippen Street from Meagher Street Ms Chauncy said that she saw what she thought was a couple of men, who she thought were just mates “kind of mucking around together” at the end of the street. She and Mr Bourke continued walking towards the incident and as they came closer she realised it was 3 men, one of them having no shirt on. Obviously that was the Accused so I will refer to him in that way when referring to her evidence. She said they realised that the men were fighting. She said she saw the Accused hitting the other men with his hands. She could not say how many times but it was more than once. The other two men were hitting back. They identified themselves as police officers by saying, “We’re the police, help us”. She was a couple of metres away at this point. They also said, “Call triple 0”, which she later did. She said they also said that “he was trying to grab their gun”. She said “From what I could tell, it did look like he was trying to grab at it”. She thought that at that time the men were on the ground. What made her think that the Accused was trying to grab a gun was seeing him with his hands out all the time towards the hips of the policeman. She was asked if she saw whether his hand made contact with the hip of the police officer and she said, “I couldn’t say if it actually made contact”. 34 Ms Chauncy described the Accused as seeming “quite angry, like, quite strong, quite – like, he was wanting to fight”. She saw the Accused punching the officers as well as the officers punching the Accused but none of the punches seemed to her to have any effect because they all continued fighting. At one stage she saw an officer striking the Accused with a baton but that did not appear to her to have any effect either. Ms Chauncy used her mobile phone to call triple 0. Other police arrived while she was on the phone. She saw the Accused run off. She could not tell if he was injured. After he had left she said the officers were “just kind of sitting on the ground, panting”. 35 The main issue in this trial is whether I should accept the evidence of the police officers. It is significant that whilst she did not see all of the incident, Ms Chauncy did see that the Accused was punching both of the officers and that one of them did make reference to the Accused trying to grab a gun and that she saw the Accused reaching out in the direction of an officer’s gun. The fact that she could not say if he actually made contact is not significant because it is unclear at what stage of the incident she heard what the officers said and it is further unclear whether her position was such that she would have been able to see contact made by the Accused with Constable Evans’ gun. Overall, whilst Ms Chauncy’s evidence does not completely support the evidence of the police, it is consistent with it, and inconsistent with the account given by the Accused. He, for example, said he did not strike the officers at all.36 Mr Bourke gave evidence that as he and Ms Chauncy turned the corner into Chippen Street from Meagher Street he saw an altercation between 3 males who were all wearing shirts. He said what he first saw was two of the males holding the other male up against a wall on the opposite side of the street from the Waldorf Apartments. He said they were 40 to 50 metres away at this point. As they walked down the street the three men started to move across the street and by the time they were closer, the men were in the middle of the street. Mr Bourke was asked whether he had been watching the fight as it moved from the wall to the middle of the street and he said “not really”. He said he was keeping his eye on it but he was more concerned for his and Ms Chauncy’s safety. What he observed as the men moved from the wall to the middle of the street was the Accused managing to break free and try and move away with the other two men pursuing him. He said that as they got close the two men announced that they were New South Wales police officers and that they needed help. He said they asked for triple 0 to be called. He said he saw the officers punching the Accused. One had the Accused in a headlock and he was being punched to the face. He said that until he drew abreast of the incident he did not see the Accused punching the officers – that, of course, must be considered in the light of his evidence that he was “not really” watching but “keeping his eye on it”. He said that the Accused seemed to be trying to break free of the struggle, doing what he could to get away. It appeared to him that the Accused was reaching for one of the officer’s guns and he saw his hand end up on the pistol. He was asked if he noticed whether the pistol remained in the holster and he said, “Yes, it remained in the holster”. He said that when the Accused had his hand on the holster he was trying to free the weapon by reefing his arm backwards more than once. This was something that Mr Bourke focussed on to the extent that he was unaware of what the other officer was doing at the time. Mr Bourke said that at this time he was 5 to 10 metres away with nothing obscuring his view. The next specific part of the incident he spoke of was seeing the Accused break free and the officers grabbing him and pushing him onto the bonnet of a parked car. Between the gun incident and the Accused being on the bonnet he did not see the police punching the Accused at all. A short time later in his evidence he said he was sure that the Accused made attempts to hit the police between the gun incident and being on the bonnet, but then said it was more like pushing and shoving rather than actual blows. He did not see the police using any batons on the Accused up to that point but he said that “after the incident with the car he ended up being pushed to the ground and the officers removed their batons and proceeded to hit him. He felt there was nothing the Accused could do at that stage. He said, “He just lay there and took a beating”. At that point, he said he and Ms Chauncy proceeded to walk away. Mr Bourke did not see the police using their capsicum spray at any point. When he and Ms Chauncy got to the Waldorf Apartments he saw the Accused running away. He said the Accused was frightened, although he did not explain the basis of that opinion. He also said that he was bloody, mostly to the face. 37 Mr Bourke’s evidence assists the prosecution in that he claims to have seen the Accused attempting to get one of the officer’s gun. It does not assist in that he said the gun remained in the holster. Further, he was not certain that the Accused’s blows landed on either of the officers, the highest he could put it was that “they probably would have”. However, his evidence is unsatisfactory in a number of respects in that he claims that he saw things happen that obviously did not. He claims that after being on the bonnet of the car the Accused was pushed to the ground and both officers then proceeded to beat him with their batons, whereas it is common ground that only one officer, Constable Evans’, hit the Accused with a baton, and that was before the incident at the car bonnet. When I asked him to clarify the position of the Accused in relation to Constable Evans at the time when the Accused touched the officer’s gun, he said that the constable had him in a headlock with the Accused’s body behind him and head in front of him. This is clearly inconsistent with all of the other evidence which is to the effect that the Accused and the Constable were facing each other at that time. Further, Mr Bourke claims that the Accused had blood over him, including his face, as he ran from the scene. No-one else, including the Accused, has suggested that.38 A matter of general concern about Mr Bourke’s evidence is that it was obvious a number of times that he was speculating or offering opinions as to what was happening, rather than simply relating what he saw. For example, when he was talking about the Accused “trying to free the weapon” he said he was not using maximum force because if he had done so the weapon would not have stayed where it was. Mr Bourke apparently did not know that the weapon was secured in the holster with a restraining strap. This tendency to speculate or offer opinions makes me guarded about accepting Mr Bourke’s evidence generally. I am only inclined to accept his evidence where it is clearly something that he actually observed and not the result of him making assumptions or the product of his opinions.39 One matter to consider in relation to the evidence of both Ms Chauncy and Mr Bourke is the stage of the incident they observed when they say they saw the Accused touching Constable Evans’ gun. CCTV material, which I will refer to later, indicates that these two witnesses came close to the incident towards the end of the time that the Accused can be seen with his left hand in the vicinity of Constable Evans right hip. If Constable Evans is right that there was a continued struggle over the gun subsequent to its brief removal from, and replacement in, the holster, then it appears that what Ms Chauncy and Mr Bourke witnessed was that continuation of the struggle and not the early part of it.40 The Accused gave evidence that on 26 January 2007 he caught a taxi from Chinatown to Chippen Street and had arranged to meet his grandfather at 8.30pm across the road in Cleveland Street. He said he was first aware of the presence of police when he saw the police car reversing towards him. He did not explain how he knew that the plain clothed occupants of the unmarked car were police. The Accused said that the driver alighted and ran up to him and he recognised him as Constable Owen who he had prior dealings with, having charged him with offences that were subsequently dismissed. The Accused said that he thought to himself that Constable Owen would charge him for whatever he can so he decided not to do anything and to put his hands up against the wall and just comply with whatever they say, so as to avoid being arrested and charged for any sort of offence. So, he said that he put his hands up against the wall and said, “I don’t want any trouble, do whatever youse want” and “I’ve done nothing wrong”. Constable Evans joined Constable Owen and the Accused recognised him as well from a past encounter. The Accused said he was told, “You don’t have to do that”, presumably a reference to him having his hands up against the wall. He then kneeled on the ground and was then told to sit on the ground which he did. 41 He said that the officers said they were going to do “a warrant check, a bail check”, and Constable Evans then returned to the police car. While he was away, a conversation ensued with Constable Owen in which they discussed the details of the Accused’s bail and about the last time that he had been in trouble. The Accused also told Constable Owen that he was going to TAFE and was trying to stay out of trouble, did not want to do anything wrong and did not want to go back to gaol. The Accused then asked if it was all right for him to go as he had not done anything wrong but Constable Owen told him to wait there. 42 Constable Evans returned after about 5 minutes. The Accused said that Constable Evans told him to get up off the ground. He said, “They told me to turn around and face the wall. At no stage did they say, ‘You’re under arrest, you have the right to remain silent’”, or anything like that. The Accused said that at this stage he did not say anything. He was turning around to face the wall when he felt a push on his back up against the wall. He turned around to say, “What’s going on?”. He was again pushed and “they” said, “Turn around, turn around, face the wall”. 43 The Accused said that he remembered getting grabbed and pushed, or hit. He stumbled and that’s when he felt the police grabbing him and trying to hold him. He then remembered getting hit, getting placed in a choke hold, getting kneed, kicked and punched. 44 At some stage he tried to get away from the officers. He was asked how and he said, “I just wiggled away from them”. He wiggled his arms but did not thrash them around. He was not attempting to strike the officer or land blows on them. 45 When he was being pushed against the wall and then struck and manhandled in the various ways he described he said he was wondering to himself what was going on because he had not done anything wrong. He reiterated that at no stage had he been told that he was under arrest or had his rights read to him. 46 He described his shirt coming off at a time when he was leaning forward and an officer was grabbing at him. He had been punched before this happened. He was asked if at any stage he punched the police and he said, “I don’t hit police. I don’t hit people in general, especially police”. He was asked specifically whether he punched the police on this occasion and he said, “No”. 47 The Accused recalled being sprayed with capsicum spray by Constable Owen and struck with a baton by Constable Evans. He also said that every time the officers could see that his face was open he was struck repeatedly to the face. He added at that point that “At no time did I try to swing at the police”. He said that all he was trying to do was stay on his feet, thinking that because of the way they were punching him, if he went to the ground he was going to get hurt very badly. However, on a couple of occasions he was flung to the ground. He recalled at one stage being thrown up against the bonnet of a car. The officers were trying to grab him again. He was sprayed again. He said that was about the time when he ran away. 48 The Accused said that at no stage did he attempt to grab Constable Evans’ gun. He said at one stage when he was being held in a headlock he had no option but to “be in that area”, that is the area of the constable’s gun, but he did not deliberately go to that area. He gave a description similar to that given by the officers of facing Constable Evans but being bent over and held in a headlock, so he had both his arms around the constable’s waist area. He said, “I could have touched his holster, but I never touched his holster with intent to take his gun, or to take his mace or handcuffs, or anything like that. … I had no intentions of doing that”. He denied the suggestion that his hand had come back and forward in what was described by Mr Bourke as a “reefing motion”. He said he did move his hands, but that was only to try and block punches to his face. 49 The Accused denied having any familiarity with how a police service pistol is secured in its holster. He denied that Constable Evans’ pistol ever came out of its holster. He denied attempting to grab his holster. 50 In relation to the evidence of previous arrests, and an attempted arrest, of the Accused in December 2006 and January 2007, the Accused said at one stage in cross-examination that it made him feel like Redfern police were targeting him (T211). Four pages later in the transcript he directly denied feeling that Redfern police were targeting him (T215). 51 The Accused said twice in his evidence in chief that he was not told that he was under arrest and that it was for breach of bail (T.194.25 and 195.40). He repeated this in cross-examination at T217.2. At T217.9 he said he did not remember. He was then asked, “Are you saying that he didn’t say it, or you just don’t recall it?” and he replied, “I don’t remember him saying those words” (the words being, “you are under arrest for breach of bail, but before I caution you we’re going to handcuff you because I know you’ve run away from police before”). After that, he said on 5 occasions that he was not told that he was being arrested for breach of bail (T220.25, 220.41, 221.43, 225.5, 226.20), on one occasion he did not think he was told (T225.13) and on 4 occasions said he did not remember (T220.22, 220.46, 226.9, 227.7)52 There was no clear statement by the Accused that he felt it necessary to assault the officers, or to resist their attempt to arrest him, in order to defend himself or to prevent or terminate the unlawful deprivation of his liberty. Indeed, the Accused denied assaulting the officers. There is, in fact, little that the Accused said about his reasons for acting as he did. In evidence in chief: 
     
      
       
      “Q. At what point in time, from what you told us happened, did you start to attempt to get away?  
       
       
      A. After I was already pushed and hit and pushed up against the wall, and as far as I could see, I was thinking; what's going on here. I haven't done anything wrong. In my mind, I haven't done anything wrong and I was getting pushed around and pushed up against the wall and trying to be manhandled. I was thinking; what's it for? At no time did they read me my rights or tell me I was under arrest. I didn't jump - I didn't spring to my feet and start waving my arms around, a windmill motion, like, (Indicated). I didn't do that.” (T195). 
      
    53 In cross examination: 
     
      
       
      “Q. What did you think would happen if you stopped fighting and went back to the police station? 
       
        
       
      A. I don't know.  
       
      Q. If you had stopped, it's likely, isn't it, that you would have been taken back to Redfern Police Station and read your rights by the custody sergeant like you were on the last occasions?  
       
       
      A. That's right, but in my mind I didn't - I was thinking of - I thought I didn't do anything wrong and I was wondering why they're trying to push me up against the wall and handcuff me and I knew that I didn't breach my bail. That was what I was thinking in my mind. I was thinking why are they trying to do what they're doing to me.” (T218-219) 
      
    54 If the Accused was thinking “I knew that I didn’t breach my bail”, that, I am satisfied, must have been in response to some allegation being made concerning his bail. This was taken up with him at the end of his cross-examination. He said that he thought that after he had raised the mistaken belief of the police about him being in breach of his bail when he appeared in court on 3 January 2007 that the error would be corrected. Thereafter he had complied with all of the conditions of his bail. From this I conclude that he had no reason to think there was any question of him being in breach of bail when he was approached by the police on 26 January 2007. I am satisfied that the only explanation for him thinking about not being in breach of his bail was that it was provoked by having been told by the police that this was the purpose for which he was being arrested. He realised that he had not breached his bail and his thoughts were concerned with the mistaken belief of the police that he had. I do not think that because he had earlier been told that “a warrant check, a bail check” was going to be made that subsequently he would think that the police were acting as they did because they thought he was in breach of his bail. He was, as I have mentioned, of the view that prior mistakes in that respect had been rectified.55 In summary, the Accused’s account is one of two police officers stopping him, making an inquiry about him, and then endeavouring to arrest him, perhaps without telling him that he was under arrest and the reason for it. He was, to use his terms, grabbed, pushed, held, struck, placed in a choke hold (in cross examination he said he was “strangled”), punched, kneed, kicked, thrashed around, thrown around, flung to the ground, sprayed with capsicum spray, beaten with a baton and thrown against the bonnet of a car. At no time did he strike either of the officers in any fashion – “I don’t hit police”. All he claimed to have done was just “wiggle”, or “wriggle” to try and get out of the officers’ hold. He agreed in his evidence that he was physically bigger than both Constable Evans and Senior Constable Owen. At the end of all of this, he ran off. He gave no evidence of being injured in any way. 56 I find it simply too extraordinary to accept that the incident occurred in the way the Accused described. Compared to the officers, he claims that he was relatively passive. Yet he was able to evade them and run off. They came off second best, notwithstanding the violence they meted out to him without him responding with any violence at all. I find his version to be totally incredulous.57 Rejecting the Accused’s evidence does not mean that I must necessarily be satisfied that the prosecution has proved the offences beyond reasonable doubt. I must still examine the evidence in the Crown case and consider whether I am so satisfied.Should I accept the evidence of Constable Evans and Senior Constable Owen?58 The version of events given by the two Constables was, when looked at in isolation, logical and plausible. Their evidence was internally consistent and they were consistent with each other. I did not detect any element of exaggeration. There were some they conceded that might have been thought would not assist the prosecution case. For example, when something happened involving the other officer and the Accused that they might not have seen, they readily conceded that they did not see it. Similarly, Constable Evans gave evidence that he struck the Accused quite a number of times during the incidents on occasions when there are gaps in the CCTV footage. If he was trying to minimise the extent of the violence of the police towards the Accused he would be unlikely to have so readily have made such a concession.59 The demeanour of the Constables when giving their evidence is something I take into account to a limited extent. They are, of course, experienced in giving evidence and that is why demeanour can be deceiving. One particular feature, however, struck me as a useful indication of credibility. Constable Evans gave a very clear indication in the manner in which he gave his evidence of being traumatised by the memory of feeling he was in grave danger when he said the Accused had removed his pistol and it was pointing in the direction of his lower abdomen and leg. On the second day of his evidence he was being cross-examined on his evidence concerning the Accused’s actions in relation to the gun. It was put to him that the Accused never removed his gun from the holster. He denied the proposition but he became distressed to the extent that senior counsel inquired of him whether he needed to take a break. The Court did at that point take the morning adjournment to permit the officer to regain his composure. That emotion was, in my view, genuine. When the topic was raised in the course of closing addresses, Mr Young did not submit that there was any feigning by the Constable but suggested it may have been the product of the Constable having an honest yet mistaken belief that the Accused was attempting to get the gun out of the holster. He also submitted that being so traumatised by the incident was something that could be regarded as reflecting adversely on the credibility or reliability of the Constable’s evidence. In my view the evidence of Constable Evans’ was quite clear and should not be regarded as being the product of a mistaken belief about the Accused’s intentions. I cannot accept that some movement of the holster, inadvertent as the Accused claims, without the gun being removed, could be the explanation for Constable Evans to fear his life was in danger to the extent that he could either mistakenly, or falsely, claim that the gun was in fact removed from the holster, and that he would become so emotional when giving evidence about it. 60 The evidence of the two eye-witnesses, Ms Chauncy and Mr Bourke, as I have said is limited to their observations of part and not all of the entire incident. Mr Bourke’s evidence is flawed in the ways I have described. Nevertheless, in terms of the limited parts of the incident that they actually observed, and in respect of Mr Bourke, such observations that are reliable, it is more consistent with the description of the incident given by the Constables than it is with the version of the Accused. The CCTV footage61 Much of the trial was involved with an examination of the vision derived from 3 security cameras that were trained on different parts of Chippen Street. In the video footage obtained from each of the cameras there are significant gaps. It has not been suggested that there has been any tampering with the material. The explanation for the gaps is set out in the statement of Mr Damien Dunphy which is Exhibit E and there is no need to dwell upon it.62 The CCTV material is the source of a substantial part of the attack that has been made on the evidence of the two constables. There is thus a question as to whether it conflicts with their evidence and should lead to the conclusion that I should not accept their evidence which otherwise appears credible, or that I should have a reasonable doubt about it.63 One thing that can be concluded with certainty from the footage is that the incident commenced with the police car stopping adjacent to the Accused at about 7.58.25 pm and concluded with the Accused running off at about 8.07.10 pm. From the estimates of time given for the initial discussion with the Accused, Constable Evans returning to the car to make his radio inquiry and then returning to the Accused, I infer that the physical aspect of the incident commenced at about 8.05 pm. From the one camera that shows the altercation in the middle of the road, the participants do not come within view until 8.05.56. There is a gap in the footage from that camera from 8.02.59 until then. From a more distant camera, the 3 men are seen to move away from the area of the wall at 8.05.23. This means that the physical altercation that occurred at the wall took about 23 seconds, and the only camera that was trained in that direction was too far away for anything to be made out. The altercation then continued away from the wall for some 33 seconds before any of it is picked up and recorded by a security camera. Between 8.05.56 and the Accused running off at 8.07.10, the footage from this camera has 7 gaps totalling 33 seconds. The footage from the more distant camera is very indistinct and it is almost impossible to make out what is happening apart from seeing the police car door open and close and the movement of figures. This means that if the physical altercation started at 8.05 and continued until 8.07.10, there is only footage of some use of 41 seconds out of the 130 seconds. 64 It is not only the evidence of the constables but also that of Ms Chauncy and Mr Bourke that the Accused was striking out at the constables, or, in respect of Mr Bourke, at least appearing to do so. None of these actions of the Accused are clearly and distinctly shown in the CCTV footage that is available. I cannot accept that all 4 of these witnesses are wrong and that the Accused was passive, or, just “wiggling” and “wriggling”. This is a further indication that there are significant parts of the altercation that are just not discernible from the CCTV footage.65 It is at 8.06.27 that a woman, who I conclude is Ms Chauncy, appears in the vision and she then remains in a position on the footpath adjacent to where the altercation is going on in the middle of the road until sometime between 8.06.50 and 8.06 54 when there is one of the gaps. She is seen to be walking away from the scene with Mr Bourke following. This would tend indicate that the portions of the incident before 8.06.27 that were observed by Ms Chauncy and Mr Bourke, were seen by them before they were at the closest point to which they came. On any view of the evidence, that must include time when the Accused’s hand was in the vicinity of Constable Evans’ holster. 66 The best vision of the Accused running away from the scene is from a camera trained on the foyer of the Waldorf Apartments. It shows the Accused running on the street at 8.07.19. There is no sign of him being injured in any way, nor of him being hampered in his ability to run. 67 There is nothing on any of the footage that is available in which one can clearly see Constable Evans’ gun being removed from his holster. At 8.06.02, and in the few seconds before it, the Accused’s hand can be seen in the vicinity of the holster. There is then a gap of between 1 and 2 seconds. When the vision resumes the time is showing 8.06.04. Constable Evans from this point is clearly seen to be doing something with his right hand in the vicinity of his holster and the Accused’s hand is still in that vicinity. In the following seconds it is apparent that Constable Evans twists his body in a clockwise direction so as to take his right hip, and hence his holster, further away from the Accused. The Accused remains bent over, facing Constable Evans, with his arms on either side of the constable’s waist. 68 Constable Evans was taken through the CCTV footage a number of times. He was of the opinion that the incident when he says the gun was removed from his holster is in the gap between 8.06.02 and 8.06.04. It seemed to me that this was something of a “best guess” and it is primarily based upon the fact that from 8.06.04 he can be seen trying to do something that is consistent with trying to hold his gun down in the holster and twisting his body away from the Accused. He did not impress me as being completely confident about this. When he was asked by the Crown Prosecutor what was happening between 8.06.02 and 8.06.04 he said, “Well, it’s hard to be certain what happened, but I’m assuming that was the incident where I noticed my firearm was out of its holster because you can see by the footage at 8.06.04 I have reacted to it and my right hand has moved back towards my firearm. Mr Murray’s left hand is across my body and in the direction of my firearm, so I believe that is the time” (T27.45). There was much cross examination about this evidence and it remained the case that he was not one hundred percent certain. For example, he was reminded of his evidence that the gun being out of the holster must have been during 8.06.03 and he said, “It’s a guess, but yes” (T59.48). A little later he said, “I assume it happened at that time, but it did happen” (T63.22). Later still he said, “I presume so, yes” (T66.17). 69 Senior Constable Owen gave the impression of labouring under the same difficulty. He seemed to pinpoint the time of 8.06.05 as the time the gun was out of the holster but based this primarily on the fact that at this time his own head is seen to turn to the left. Obviously in the course of the altercation his head would have been turning frequently. I formed the distinct impression from the manner in which Constable Owen gave his evidence that he too was having a “best guess” at a time when the gun was, on his account, out of the holster.70 The vision around the time of 8.06.02 is not entirely clear. I have viewed the entire footage quite a number of times, both in court and since retiring to consider my verdicts. 71 After the gap from 8.02.59 the vision at 8.05.56 picks up with the Accused bent over, facing Constable Evans and moving his hands around the constable’s waist. There is nothing to indicate that this was necessarily the initiation of his grappling with his hands in the vicinity of the constable’s appointments belt. Indeed, the police evidence is to the effect that he had made an attempt to remove items by opening the pouches on the constable’s left hand side prior to the incident in the vicinity of the gun holster. The evidence is that it was after the grabbing at the handcuffs and spray pouches that the Accused was sprayed with capsicum spray for the first time. It is common ground that this first spraying was before 8.05.56. It seems to me to be a reasonable proposition that the activity in relation to the appointments belt prior to the vision commencing at 8.05.56 included the incident relating to the gun holster.72 I conclude that it is possible that the gun came out of the holster in the 8.06.02 to 8.06.04 gap. It also seems to me to be possible that it came out at an earlier time not captured on the footage and that what is seen when the footage picks up at 8.05.56 is a continuation of the struggle for the gun. Constable Evans did say that after the gun was returned to the holster the Accused continued trying to get at it. It seems more likely to me that this is what is seen at 8.06.02 and following. 73 My overall view of the CCTV material is that it is insufficiently clear, and insufficiently complete, to present a reliable account of all aspects of the altercation between the Accused and the police. Clearly a lot more went on than can be seen. I agree with Mr Young that the CCTV material does not corroborate the evidence of the police officers that the gun was removed from the holster. At best, it corroborates their evidence of having a concern about the Accused’s actions in relation to that gun, particularly where it shows Constable Evans with his right hand firmly holding down the gun in the holster and twisting the right side of his body away from the Accused’s left hand.Could the Accused have been able to remove the gun from the holster?74 Another issue to determine is the likelihood of the Accused being able to remove the gun from the holster.75 Constable Evans’ appointments belt was tendered and became Exhibit C. He gave a demonstration in the course of his evidence as to how the restraining strap had to be manipulated in order to release it and permit the gun to be released from the holster. From my examination of it I am satisfied that this is something that can be done quite easily and that a person involved in a struggle and grabbing at the holster from the position the Accused was in could manage to remove the restraining strap with relative ease. It would not be at all easy for a person who was in another position relative to the constable but being forward and bent down below him coincides best with the movement of the strap that is required. It would not be necessary for such a person to be looking at the holster. It may be that the Accused was not. It would not require prior knowledge of how the restraining strap worked. From the position he was in, just grabbing at the holster with the natural pressure one would expect from the position he was in would be sufficient.Were the officers acting in the execution of their duty?76 It is necessary to make a finding as to whether the officers were acting in the execution of their duty because that is an element of the offences in Counts 1 to 4 and relevant to elements in Counts 5 and 6. 77 I am satisfied that, although it was not strictly necessary, the Accused was informed of the matters in s.201 of LEPRA. I am satisfied that he did not co-operate at the initial phase after being informed he was under arrest. Thereafter there was an escalating level of violence. The actions of the police started with talking and progressed to holding, kneeing, punching, spraying, and then striking with a baton. None of these actions seemed to have any effect at all upon the Accused. I am satisfied that the violence emanating from the police was in response to their inability to restrain and detain the Accused because of the increasing level of resistance he was offering. I am satisfied that this remained within the concept of “reasonable force” in the circumstances that prevailed. Moreover, after having attempted to obtain Constable Evans’ gun, almost any level of force would be regarded as reasonable in order to subdue the Accused and secure his apprehension.78 I am therefore satisfied that the officers were at all times acting in the execution of their duty. It follows that I am satisfied that the elements of “lawful apprehension” in Count 5 and of “lawful custody” in Count 6 have been established.Self Defence79 As to the issue of self defence that has been raised in this trial, I must say I have reservations about whether the evidentiary onus has been met. The Accused specifically denies assaulting the police officers. His resistance to the officers, he says, amounted to “wiggling” or “wriggling” out of their grip. I have previously set out the best of what the Accused said in his evidence as to his reasons for acting as he did.80 But, then at T224.50, the Accused was asked by the Crown Prosecutor, “Mr Murray, you did not think that what you did in the whole fight, the whole resist arrest, was necessary to defend yourself, did you?” and he replied, “Yes I did”. There was no attempt to amplify on this in the ensuing cross-examination or in re-examination.81 Mr Young did not explicitly contend that I would find in the Accused’s favour on the self defence issue even if I rejected his evidence and accepted the prosecution evidence. Nevertheless I have considered the issue in that way as well. 82 In the end I am left with the conclusion that the Accused did not do what he did in order to defend himself or to prevent or terminate an unlawful deprivation of his liberty. I am satisfied that what he did was solely designed to avoid a lawful arrest. 83 In cross examination the Accused agreed that on 18 December 2006 he was approached by some police and told that he was being arrested for breach of bail. He thought that he was not in breach of bail so he ran off. He was asked why he ran off on that occasion and he said: 
     
      
       
      “I didn't do it because I didn't want to be picked up that day. I done it because I didn't want to go back to the police station and sit in there for eight hours and being in a holding cell. It wasn't right. I shouldn't have been there. I shouldn't have been pulled over and shouldn't have been taken back to the police station in the first place.” (T203).  
      
    84 This seems to me to be the likely explanation for why the Accused acted in the way he did on 26 January 2007 as well.Conclusion85 For the reasons I have given I accept the evidence of Senior Constable Owen and Constable Evans as to all of the critical aspects of the incident in Chippen Street, Chippendale on 26 January 2007.86 In relation to Counts 1 and 2, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the two constables were acting in the execution of their duty in seeking to effect a lawful arrest of the Accused and that the Accused resisted them in such endeavours. 87 In relation to Counts 3 and 4, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that whilst they were executing their duty the two constables were each assaulted by the Accused.88 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused did attempt to obtain Constable Evans’ gun, which was clearly an offensive weapon, in order to use it in some way to prevent his lawful apprehension.89 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Accused was, albeit temporarily, in the lawful custody of the two constables and that he escaped from that custody.90 I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown has disproved that in relation to any of these matters the Accused was acting in self defence.91 I return verdicts of guilty on all counts.

      SENTENCE 
       
       
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 12 September 2008 Mazen Touma (the offender) pleaded guilty to each of four charges contained in an indictment presented against him on that day. The charges were: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Between about 5 April 2005 and about 24 October 2005, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, Mazen Touma did an act, namely acquired substantial quantities of firearm ammunition, in preparation for a terrorist act, or acts. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Between about 5 April 2005 and about 24 April 2005, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, Mazen Touma did an act, namely attempted to make one or more improvised explosive devices, in preparation for a terrorist act, or acts. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) On or about 8 November 2005, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, Mazen Touma possessed a thing, namely a collection of items including lengths of copper pipe, gun powder, 165 railway detonators, instructional notes and dismantled firearm ammunition, connected with preparation for a terrorist act, or acts, knowing of that connection. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) On or about 8 November 2005, at Sydney in the State of New South Wales, Mazen Touma possessed a thing, namely a collection of documents, including electronic documents, images, videos and audio files, connected with preparation for a terrorist act, or acts, knowing of that connection. 
        
       
      
    2 As I have said, the offender pleaded guilty to each of these charges. This sentence hearing commenced on that day and he was thereupon convicted of each of the four charges. The sentence hearing was ultimately adjourned to Friday 10 October 2008 when oral submissions were taken. The parties had, prior to this date, filed written submissions. The sentence proceedings were adjourned to today for pronouncement of sentence. 
     
      
    3 The Court's task now is to state the facts of the matter, consider the competing submissions from the Crown and the legal representatives for the offender, and to impose sentence.  
     
      
       
      Background to the present plea 
       
      
    4 The offender is one of nine men who were arrested and charged in 2005 with a terrorism related offence. The charge in the original indictment was that the offender, and the other men, conspired together to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act, or acts. With the exception of one accused, who has been granted a separate trial on the basis of his unfitness for trial, the remaining accused are to be tried by a judge and jury. The empanelment of the jury is to occur during the week commencing 27 October 2008. In view of the offender's willingness to plead guilty to the four individual charges in the present indictment, the Director of Public Prosecutions has indicated that he will not proceed further against the offender in relation to the serious conspiracy charge.  
     
      
       
      Criminal History 
       
      
    5 Before embarking on the statement of facts relevant to this sentencing exercise, I should mention that the offender has a very limited criminal history. Apart from a matter in the Children's Court in 1997, the offender was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in the Redfern Local Court and fined $1,000, together with Court costs. Nearly a year later, on 22 September 1999, the offender was found guilty in relation to two charges, being possession of a prohibited drug and ""resist officer"" in execution of duty. On each charge the offender was placed on a recognisance to be of good behaviour for twelve months. These matters are, as I have indicated, of little or no moment when compared to the seriousness of the charges to which the offender has now pleaded guilty. 
     
      
       
      Agreed Facts 
       
      
    6 After consultation and sensible discussion between the parties, the Court has been provided with an agreed statement of facts. This is a very detailed document. It sets out the background to the commission of the offences, and then lists the facts in relation to each separate count in the indictment. It will be convenient and appropriate to set out the material in full in this decision.  
     
      
       
      Background to the commission of the offences 
       
      
    7 In 2004 and 2005 Police undertook an investigation of the activities of a number of persons, as a result of which the offender was arrested and charged. At the time of the commission of the offences, the offender was a devout Muslim and held certain beliefs in relation to his interpretation of the Muslim faith. Those beliefs included the following:  
     
      
      (a) that Islam throughout the world was under attack and that there was, as a consequence, a religious obligation to come to the defence of Islam and other Muslims; 
       
        
       
      (b) that “Jihad” was the primary means by which this religious obligation should be fulfilled; and 
       
      
    8 (c) that a significant and legitimate aspect of the fulfilment of this obligation was violent Jihad which involved the application of force and violence including, in certain circumstances, the killing of “infidels” or “kuffir” (that is, persons who do not have the same fundamentalist beliefs).9 The views held by the offender are evidenced by (inter alia) the finding of a large volume of material supporting such views (“extremist material”) at his premises upon the execution of a search warrant at the time of his arrest. That material is the subject of Count 4 in the Indictment. 
     
      
    10 The views held by the offender are also evidenced by statements made by him in the course of conversations with others. These were recorded, under warrant, by listening devices and telephone intercepts during the course of the Police investigation. Examples of those conversations are set out in the following thirteen paragraphs. 
     
      
    11 On 22 June 2005 at 10.31pm, there was a discussion between the offender and 2 other persons recorded by a listening device. During the conversation, the offender stated that he had “never ever saw, so strict about the Sunna until I hung out with Ahl Al-Sunna Wal Jamaa” [Ahel al Sunna Wal Jumma Association]. The offender encouraged the person to whom he was speaking to attend the prayer hall because with these people “you can’t go wrong” because “these people speak the truth and when they talk, they talk with proof and the doctrine…cannot go wrong.”  
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    12 On 7 July 2005 at 7.24 pm, there was a telephone conversation between the offender and another person during which the offender said the following:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
          “ 
          ..you can’t love infidels brother. How do you go save a man, an infidel against a Muslim when Muslims are at war with these people…God has promised that an infidel, whoever kills an infidel, the Muslim that kills an infidel they will never meet in hell 
          .”  
           
          
         
        
       
      
    13 On 9 July 2005 at 6.03 pm, there was a telephone conversation between the offender and another person during which the offender was told on a number of occasions not to talk on the telephone. During this conversation the offender spoke about Clerics who had been martyred.  
     
      
    14 On 11 July 2005 at 8.30 pm, there was a conversation between the offender and another person which was recorded on a listening device. They discussed issues relating to Islam, including attempts by the West to clamp down on terrorism by encouraging Sheiks to give “fatwa” favourable to the west. The offender claimed that the West was attempting to arrange for fatwas to be given precluding the use of suicide bombings. The conversation included the following: 
     
      
      TOUMA: 
        
      “But look, you know what else he said. He said that the fatwa they are giving they are trying to kill suicide bombing completely to make people have fears of it and to warn people against it so that people can think that suicide bombing is forbidden. This is the most things they are trying to do and it is petrifying for them it is scaring the Westerners what they are doing Brother that is what he says… 
      
     
     
      
      MALE: 
        
      Please I am scared my brother I’m not the kind to wreck/destroy. 
      
     
     
      
      TOUMA: 
        
      You are not wrecking this is Sharia, this is God’s Sharia he is doing something you have no guts to say something to him man. 
      
     
     
      
      MALE: 
        
      But look look I want to tell you something these people are innocent it is nothing to do with them you can’t. 
      
     
     
      
      TOUMA: 
        
      You can’t say that brother but what  
      
     
     
      
      MALE: 
        
      Yeeeeh but  
      
     
     
      
      TOUMA: 
        
      You can’t say that brother but what you cannot kill like this and like that what you mean you can’t the companions hey hey killed Abu Bakr Abu Bakr do you know about paying charity he killed Muslims because they stopped giving charity when the Prophet died. What are you talking about. These people want to talk about the sheikhs but we know and people know from their own country that America is paying them or they are with the American and they are giving legal ruling the way they want and they’re giving fatwa in this manner or in that manner.” 
      
     
     
      
    15 On 23 July 2005 at 7.17 pm the offender and his wife were recorded discussing various issues relating to Islam, including the undertaking of Jihad. The offender described being captured by the enemy as a chance to test oneself for the sake of Allah; 
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    16 On 27 July 2005 at 8.03 pm, during a conversation initially between the offender and his mother, and later between the offender and his wife Voula, there was a discussion about various issues relating to Islam. The offender described the need for undertaking Jihad and in doing so, he criticized Taj el-Din, whom he said his mother still supported, saying that Taj el-Din had moved away from the person he once was. The offender said that Islam became weak when people forgot about Jihad. When relating to his wife the conversation he had just had with his mother, the offender said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
            
           
          
         
        “Jihad still exists until the day of judgment brother, you  
        can’t change it, you can’t 
         change it. Then I explained to her [his mother] a Hadith about innocent people, why they die. Why Islam doesn’t kill innocent people. But innocent people die in war, its an unfortunate thing innocent people die in war, that is how it is, you know what I mean. 
        
       
      
    17 And later: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Hey,  
        I seek refuge from Satan 
         Allah promised, promised that I seek protection from Allah you’ve just told me that you will rely on Allah and Allah promised the Mujahidd [sic] that when he goes he look after his family when you are going out for the sake of  
        Allah glory and almighty he is 
        . Allah promised this sister and if you do this and if you put you through hardship this is to reward them more. I do go why do  
        this world 
        . OK you are saying that what if tomorrow I am driving on the way to the Mosque and I have an accident and die what are youse going to do? What are youse going to do I am not going to be around forever. Do you understand that? I told her to understand that, my wife’s not going to be around forever, my son is not going to be around forever, my  
        darling 
         everyone dies. I told her everyone dies. Wherever you are Allah says call him  
        indeed the death from which you flee – indeed it will meet you then you will be returned to the Noah of the unseen and the witnessed and he will inform about what you used to do 
        .” 
         
          
           
            
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    18 On 31 July 2005, the offender had a telephone conversation with another person. During that conversation there was discussion about Islamic teachings, obtaining Islamic tapes and CDs, and having a computer installed to view the programs. There was also a discussion about which moderate “Clerics” were going on “the Denton Show”. The offender said that the Clerics thought that this was good for Islam but they were ruining it because the media knew how to manipulate them. They talked about other Islamic schools of thought and Muslim fundamentalist groups. The offender said that the moderate Islamic teachings were “the work of the infidels to deviate the Muslims” and by such teachings “the war for America becomes easier”.  
     
      
       
        
         
        
       
      
    19 On 5 August 2005 at about 4.10 pm, the offender had a conversation with his mother where he expressed his willingness to undertake Jihad. He said that in response to his mother’s protestations, he had stated that Jihad is an obligation for all Muslims and that he did not need her permission. The offender also said: “I place God’s satisfaction above your [his mother’s] satisfaction”. He also said: “one should do a deed to satisfy his God, the Almighty”. The offender said that his mother should be patient because tomorrow they will all be living in paradise and she could see her children as much as she liked. The offender then discussed with his wife the conversation he had had with his mother. He also described the pressures that “Sheikh Osama” felt before undertaking Jihad (in circumstances where Sheikh Osama’s mother begged him not to do so). The offender spoke of Allah giving him paradise for martyrdom and stated that there is an “obligation on every Muslim to defend his faith to fight for the religion of God against the infidels”.20 A short time later on 5 August 2005 between about 6.57 pm and 7.07 pm, there was a conversation between the offender and another person in which the offender said that he loved being called Osama Bin LADEN. The offender then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “...we [as Muslims are] terrorist because (ind.) all of us [Muslims] to be terrorists. (Ind) the terrorism way huh…and God the Almighty he said…prepare for them whatever power and arms you are capable of with which terrorise the enemy of God you’re your enemies…terrorise is to terrorise. (Ind) God and your enemy. So therefore if you’re going to terrorise you’re a terrorist. So we [Muslims] are terrorists ….. If they kill me I get  
        martyrdom 
        ”.  
        
       
      
     
    21 On 25 August 2005, there was a telephone conversation between the offender and his wife during which the offender discussed the rationale for engaging in militant Jihad. 
     
      
    22 On 4 September 2005 at 9.53 am, there was a telephone conversation between the offender and another person during which they discussed a third party having meetings with ASIO about “anti terrorism and all that”. The offender stated: “may God never grant them success … May God exact revenge upon them”. The offender also stated that “the victory of God is soon to come … how are ya gonna get victory without hardship”. There was then a discussion about hurricane Katrina destroying New Orleans and how this event revealed the wrath of almighty God. In a conversation with another person shortly afterwards, the offender stated that the destruction from hurricane Katrina showed that “the Mujahedin’s supplication doesn’t go astray”.  
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        
       
      
    23 On 24 March 2005 at 11.49 am, there was a telephone conversation between the offender and another person when, in reference to a discussion about shooting people, the offender said “It’s a…it’s a order from God to be like that too man ….. it’s part of the preparation for everything”.  
     
      
    24 In accordance with the holding of these beliefs, the offender engaged in acts in preparation for a terrorist act (or terrorist acts), and possessed things in connection with such acts, knowing of that connection.  
     
      
       
      Count 1 – The acquisition of ammunition 
       
      
    25 Between 5 April 2005 and 24 October 2005 there were a series of telephone calls between the offender and one George LORD (“LORD”). Those conversations centred upon arrangements being made by the offender for the acquisition of significant quantities of ammunition.  
     
      
    26 On 5 April 2005 at 4.56 pm, the offender called LORD, who told him that the “point 7 point six two, whatever it is...you can’t get any more”. The offender responded: “no way”. LORD said that “hunting rounds” were available but with “soft points” and that these were $15.50 a box. He also told the offender that “high velocity powder” was also available at $40 a kilo. The offender enquired as to whether the latter was the “most like, powerful stuff” and whether there was a limit to how much could be supplied. 
     
      
    27 On 6 April 2005 at 8.11 am, there was a telephone discussion between the offender and LORD about the payment terms in relation to the proposed purchase of ammunition. A few minutes later there was a discussion as to the amount to be ordered, timing and payment terms. Later that day, the offender confirmed that it was a definite order. 
    28 On 6 April 2005 at 1.05pm, there was a telephone conversation between the offender and his wife, during which the offender asked his wife to obtain an item from the front pocket of his “army vest” and take it to his mother, where he would pick it up. During the conversation the item was referred to in code as “a block of chocolate”. On the following day, 7 April 2005, the offender again spoke with LORD and told him that he would bring half the money, being $4,000, “tonight”. LORD stated that the ammunition would not be ordered by the supplier until he had received that amount. 
     
      
       
      On 8 April 2005 at 4.30pm, LORD called the offender, who asked: “Hey, what did you get? A kilo uh?” LORD replied: “yeah I got you ... yeah. … [they are] in plastic containers now”. The offender enquired whether they were the same size. LORD responded:”yeah, half a kilo, yeah, actually they’re, they’re heavy, heavy, heavy grades, you know”. The offender responded: “Right, so they’re good ones?” LORD told him: “yeah, the good one mate, I said they’re heavy grades”. The offender responded: “they’re, they’re the best ones, uh…oh beautiful”. Arrangements were made for the offender to go to LORD’s at around 6.30pm.  
       
      
    29 On 9 April 2005, there was further discussion between the offender and LORD about the terms and conditions of the proposed supply of ammunition. LORD said that he would contact the offender on the following day. 
     
      
    30 On 10 April 2005 at 8.41am, LORD called the offender. He told him to come past that afternoon as his [LORD's] friends had given him “the list” of items (ammunition) to be supplied which included “certain rounds that you can’t find anywhere”. The offender asked: “should I come past real quick?” LORD replied: “yeah, well come past yeah.” The offender responded: “I’ll come past real quick”. 
     
      
    31 On 15 April 2005 at 11.47pm, LORD told the offender: “Come past ‘cause I rang him…he’s going somewhere, so he goes…come, pick ‘em up”. 
     
      
    32 On 16 April 2005 at 8.31am, the offender called LORD. They discussed various types of ammunition purchased on the offender’s behalf. The offender stated that he would collect them either that night or the next day. LORD again rang the offender at 8.36 am and discussed the size of a particular type of ammunition. Later that day, at 5.28 pm, LORD called the offender and told him that he was “home” and to “come and get it now”. 
     
      
    33 On 19 April 2005 at 8.09 am, there was a telephone conversation between LORD and the offender during which LORD asked the offender if he still wanted “those things” [ammunition]. The offender said that he would “come and grab them” from LORD and that he would “definitely [be] getting money tonight”. They also talked about the price of the ammunition. 
     
      
    34 On 20 April 2005 at 10 am, there was a telephone conversation between the offender and LORD during which they discussed the offender needing to receive money before he could pay for the ammunition. 
     
      
    35 On 24 April 2005 at 11.09 am, LORD called the offender and asked him whether the ammunition was required. The offender stated that it was required “100%” and indicated that he was likely to give LORD the money that night. 
     
      
    36 On 26 April 2005 at 8.56 am, the offender received a telephone call from LORD. The following conversation took place: 
     
      
       
        
       
       
      LORD: 
        
      … 
      “You know my Winchester [rifle] 
      . 
       
       
      TOUMA: 
        
      Yeah 
      . 
       
       
      LORD: 
        
      I let one go last night…Mate, talk about nuclear warhead… 
       
       
      TOUMA: 
        
      …Where, where’d you do it? 
       
       
      LORD: 
        
      At the front…Fuckin’ solid mate, solid as (ind) a kick, you wouldn’t believe it…I just aimed it up in the air…if I went to the tower maybe I would have taken the tower down… 
       
       
      TOUMA: 
        
      …How many of them…rounds have you got?” 
       
       
      
    37 Later in the same conversation, the offender told LORD to “ask Harry” about something that the offender had told LORD the previous day, saying: “I don’t want nothing with a small thing, only like…nice heavy like, like yours, you know like…a big kick and that on it…As long as… it’s in good condition and it works good…It doesn’t matter if it’s second hand”. They agreed to speak to each other later. 
     
      
    38 On 3 May 2005 at 5.42 pm, the offender received a call from LORD. During this call there was discussion between the offender and LORD about the use of a rifle. LORD provided assistance to the offender on how to use that rifle. LORD told the offender to bring the rifle to him the next day and he would show the offender how to use it. 
     
      
    39 On 10 May 2005 at about 6.46pm, the offender called LORD during which the following conversation about the offender purchasing ammunition took place:  
     
      
      TOUMA: 
        
      “Remember them things I was asking you about…to get off Harry… 
       
       
      LORD: 
        
      Yeah 
      . 
       
       
      TOUMA: 
        
      They’re for 35 each? 
       
       
      LORD: 
        
      Yeah… 
       
       
      TOUMA: 
        
      …Alright. Is there any… chance in the world you’ve got any …of that same one…now? 
       
       
      LORD: 
        
      Nuh…Not that round…not that size. 
       
       
      TOUMA: 
        
      I just thought you would have had from your old one or some…no ………. 
       
       
      LORD: 
        
      No, I’ve got, I’ve probably got some…But not, not for that price. 
       
       
      TOUMA: 
        
      OK, well, how much you want to sell them…50 bucks? 
      ... 
       
       
      LORD: 
        
      …Mine are completely different, you know what I mean? 
       
       
      TOUMA: 
        
      Yeah, yeah, I know what you’re saying…How much…go see how much you’ve got and ring me back” 
      . 
       
      
    40 On 10 May 2005 at 6.51pm, the offender again called LORD about the ammunition they had just discussed. LORD said: “I’ve got 49 of them…one missing…say a box…these are mine…my load”. The offender then asked: “…what do you want for them” and LORD replied: “I want at least seventy…’cause they’re hectic…they’re full soft…they’re blunt …”. The offender said that he would ring him back.  
     
      
    41 On 16 May 2005 at 4.55 pm, the offender received a call from LORD. LORD said that he could only get 8 and a half thousand at a cost of 75 for each 1,000 and if the offender wanted them he needed to grab them “now”. The offender told LORD that he would ring him when he sorted it out. 
     
      
    42 On 16 May 2005 at 4.59 pm, the offender received another call from LORD. LORD wanted to know whether there was going to be a problem with the purchase [of ammunition]. LORD said that he would “be getting them down” Thursday or Friday. 
     
      
    43 On 24 May 2005 at 7.08 pm, the offender received a call from LORD. LORD told the offender: “what we ordered is in…The bang bang.” The offender said: “…that stuff I asked you about today please get it for me…see how much…how it comes, like what form it comes …it’s really important…I’ll sort out the money for that other stuff”. They arranged to speak in the morning.  
     
      
    44 On 3 June 2005 at 7.14 am, the offender called LORD and told him that he was going to pick up the ammunition that day, probably at about 12.30, 1.00 or 2.00 pm. LORD said that he would be at work so he would leave “them” on the veranda and that someone would be at home. LORD told the offender to come before 9.00 or in the afternoon. 
     
      
    45 On 3 June 2005 at 7.34am, LORD called the offender and told him that he [LORD] had the ammunition on the veranda and to pick them up as soon as possible. The offender responded that he would collect them in an hour or so. 
     
      
    46 On 3 June 2005 at 9.32 am, the offender attended LORD’s premises at 95 Griffith Street, Punchbowl. At approximately 10.40am on that day he was observed to load boxes of ammunition into his (i.e. the offender’s) van which was parked directly outside that address. A short time later the offender left in another vehicle, but his van remained outside Lord’s premises. At 10.53 am, the offender called LORD and told him that there were only 15 boxes, not 16 boxes. The offender suggested that one of the boxes must have been left inside LORD’s house and arrangements were made for the offender to collect it. LORD told the offender that he would stop work at 3 o’clock and would then “come down”. 
     
      
    47 On 3 June 2005 at approximately 1.30 pm, police approached the offender’s van which was stationary and unoccupied outside 95 Griffiths Avenue, Punchbowl. Police located and seized from the van 15 boxes of ammunition which contained 7,500 rounds of 7.62 × 39mm calibre ammunition. This type of ammunition is used in SKS or AK-47 type semi-automatic weapons.  
     
      
    48 On 5 September 2005 at 7.21 am, LORD telephoned the offender and their subsequent conversation included the following: 
     
      
      LORD: 
        
      “Just so, sort out with…you sort out for the, the drums.

      LORD:

      TOUMA:

      LORD: 
        
      What about the 40 litre drums?

      TOUMA: 
        
      Um probably… today’s Wednesday. I’m just waiting for my money to come man. I got no money bro.” 
       
      
    49 This conversation related to obtaining ammunition. 
     
      
    50 On 17 September 2005 at 7.28 pm, the offender telephoned LORD and asked whether he was “going up tomorrow?” The offender told LORD: “Before you go, can you just ring me so I can come and give you money … did you tell him about them things and everything as well, have you got them? You know which ones, hey, the thousand of them?” LORD replied: “I told them but the thing is, I mean…I mean, he’s got to order them in”. 
     
      
    51 On 18 September 2005 at 4.26 pm, the offender attempted to telephone LORD. The call went to message bank. The offender left the following message: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yeah George, it’s me Maz. Er, I’m tryin’ to call ya man but obviously you’re not answering your phone. Give me a call man as soon as you get the message, before you go up if you can. Bye. Or if you don’t…if you don’t get the message, you know the, the … the 45 litre drums of the white (ind) paint, leave me, leave 5 boxes of ‘em, there. (ind) Just leave 5 drums and I’ll pick ‘em up off ya later.” 
        
       
      
    52 On 19 September 2005 at 9.15 am, the offender telephoned LORD. LORD told him that he [LORD] had left his phone at home. The offender wanted to find out if LORD had got the things from “Harry”. The offender asked: “Did ya take him everything? Like the other drums and that?” The offender said that he would come past and see LORD. 
     
      
    53 On 20 September 2005 at 6.10 pm, the offender telephoned LORD. He asked: “Did you get everything?” When LORD replied that he had, the offender told him that he would come past. 
     
      
    54 On 24 September 2005 at 6.45 pm, LORD telephoned the offender and told him that he had 10 of those “forty five litre drums”. The offender asked how much he wanted for each [“drum”]. LORD told him “sixty five each”. TOUMA said: “I’ll grab your money and I’ll come.” He asked: “What happened to the other, the ones that we, the other one can we get it or? The other … the usual ones, the usual ones that you gave me the money back for?” LORD told him that he could not get any. 
     
      
    55 On 28 September 2005 at 3.30 pm, the offender had a telephone conversation with LORD. During the conversation LORD asked whether the offender still wanted the “Forty five litre drums” and if he did, he could have them tomorrow. The offender asked whether he could get any more. LORD told him he probably could but to come past anyway. The offender asked for 10 drums. 
     
      
    56 On 29 September 2005 at 9.35 pm, the offender contacted LORD. During this conversation LORD told him: “They’re, they’re here”. The offender asked: “Everything?” LORD told him: “No, not everything but you know if you want to come and pick it up now or come tomorrow”. The offender then asked: “Oh the same drums as yesterday?” LORD told him they were. Arrangements were made to meet the following day. 
     
      
    57 On 10 October 2005 at 3.29 pm, LORD telephoned the offender. The conversation included the following: 
     
      
       
      LORD: 
        
      “… I just rang Harry and he’s got all my … he’s got everything except he can’t get, we can’t, we can’t get any three 0 threes … And, um, the locker we were getting’ a fair bit of.

    61 On 25 April 2005 at 10.42am, the offender called LORD and informed him that he [the offender] still needed to get the money that night. LORD said: “…tell him if he wants some more so he’ll have to put in a order”. Later, the conversation included the following:  
     
      
      TOUMA:

      Yeah. 
       
       
      TOUMA: 
        
      But it just...I...I’ve realised now that the only way it’s gonna work is if it’s um...if it’s...if it gets held in there so tough that it...it doesn’t break, you know, that it doesn’t come out. But it spat it...right out, man. It’s...the whole piece like, perfectly, just puffed, it just spat it...straight out. So I’ve gotta find a way where I can compress it from the top like, like keep it there like, put ...I dunno what I’m gunna put. What do you reckon I can put?” 
       
      
    62 On 25 April 2005 at 5.52 pm, the offender called a friend with whom he enquired about copper plumber pipes that his friend used on job sites. The offender asked about how to seal the end of a copper pipe and whether his friend had the tools to do this. The offender asked: “if I got you five can you, can you, um, seal them?” His friend replied, “Of course”. The offender said: “if I ever need it, if I …” [asking whether he could use the equipment if needed]. The offender asked: “how big can you get them pipes?” The offender made these enquires under the guise that he was on a job site and might have to do this, although the offender commented that he was probably quitting his job. 
     
      
    63 At the time of the execution of the Search Warrant on the offender’s premises on 8 November 2005 lengths of copper pipe (some of which had one end crimped/fused closed) were found. A note book was also found which included the following entry in the handwriting of the offender: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Bearings ball, salt, firecracker powder/thick one, electric cord/firecracker cord, batteryies (sic), sealed with cotton (sic) and compress good, gun powder, uraic (sic) acid”.  
          
         
        
       
      
    64 Also found were 13 rounds of ammunition, cut in half, with the gunpowder removed. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
      Count 3 – Possession of things connected with preparation for a Terrorist Act 
       
       
        
         
          
          At the time of the execution of the Search Warrant on the offender’s premises at the time of his arrest on 8 November 2005, the following items were seized from the garage and are the subject of this count: 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) A plastic box containing nails, 2 x 500 gram containers containing a total of approximately 800 grams of gun powder, various tools, crimped copper pipe, lead sinkers, 13 projectile pieces from sawn off shotgun, 13 sawn off bottom pieces from cartridge with primers unstuck and a quantity of .45 calibre ammunition; 
         
         
        (b) 165 Railway Detonators; 
         
         
        (c) one crimping plier set. 
        
       
       
      Count 4 – Possession of things connected with preparation for a Terrorist Act 
       
      
    65 At the time of the execution of the Search Warrant on the offender’s premises on 8 November 2005, Police seized a large quantity of what has been referred to as “extremist material”. The nature and extent of that material was summarized in Annexure A to the agreed statement of facts. It included a VHS video entitled “Sheikh Osama’s Training Course”. 
     
      
    66 In relation to this fourth count, there is also available a schedule of extremist and instructional material. This relates to a number of items tendered for the purposes of the sentencing hearing. There is no need for me to detail each and every one of these. There are really three categories. The first category relates to ""seized media"", being a number of image files, video files, document files and audio files. Once again, there is no need for me to describe these in detail. They include, for example, images of Mujahideen training and firing weapons. They include images of a number of explosions occurring during the Iraq conflict in 2005. These are described as punishment for challenging the Muslim nation. There are images of beheadings and shootings. There is fundamentalist material of various kinds glorifying suicide bombers and praising Osama bin Laden. Finally, there are instructional images dealing with sniper training, nuclear, biological and chemical warfare, and instructions on preparing firing systems, and the like. 
     
      
    67 The second category of ""seized media"" relates to files located on a number of separate disks. These were found during a search of the offender's premises on 8 November 2005. They include, for example, the virtues of martyrdom, fundamentalist concepts regarding jihad, and various instructional material relating to military and weaponry matters. There is also religious material on the methodology necessary to establish the Islamic state worldwide, and material highly critical of the United States. 
     
      
    68 The third category of ""seized images"" relates essentially to video files of beheadings, Mujahideen training and al-Qaeda instructional material, including assembly and detonation of an IED.  
     
      
    69 Finally, there is, as I mentioned earlier, a VHS cassette entitled ""Sheikh Osama's Training Course"". This material, once again, was found at the offender's premises on 8 November 2005.  
     
      
       
      The statutory framework for sentencing in Federal matters 
       
      
    70 The statutory guidepost for the exercise of the sentencing discretion in the present matter is provided by s 16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth): 
     
      
       
        
        “16A(1) In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a Federal offence, a Court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    71 Section 16A lists a number of matters which the Court must take into account ""as are relevant and known to the Court"". These include, relevantly, for the present sentencing exercise:  
     
      
     The nature and circumstances of the offence 
     The degree to which the offender has shown contrition for the offence 
     The fact that a person has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the offence 
     
     
     The deterrent effect that any sentence may have on the person 
     The character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the offender 
       
        
       
     The prospect of rehabilitation of the offender, and 
     The need to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence.   
       
    72 Although the need for general deterrence is not specifically listed among the factors in s 16A(2), a sentencing court must have full regard to the need for denunciation and general deterrence in determining the appropriate severity of the sentence in accordance with s 16A(1) (R v Paull (1990) 20 NSWLR 47; El Karhani (1990) 21 NSWLR 370). The formulation of words in s 16A(1) indicates that the sentencing principles developed at common law, rather than the various provisions in the State legislation, should apply for sentencing of Commonwealth offences (Faheem Khalid Lodhi v Regina (2007) NSWCCA 360 at [81] per Spigelman CJ; Johnson v The Queen (2004) HCA 15; (2004) 78 ALJR 616 at [15].) 
     
      
    73 It is clear that the common law concepts that are especially important in the present sentencing exercise are punishment, deterrence, denunciation and incapacitation (the last matter is often described as protection of the community - see Faheem Lodhi v Regina at [89, 97 - 109] per Spigelman CJ). In R v Martin (1999) 1 Cr App R (477 at 480), Lord Bingham CJ, as the Senior Law Lord then was, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In passing sentence for the most serious terrorist offences, the object of the Court will be to punish, deter and incapacitate: rehabilitation is likely to play a minor (if any) part.” 
        
       
      
    74 There is also a need to consider the nature and purpose of the anti-terrorism laws, the reasons for their enactment and, in the context of the precise offences, the maximum penalties prescribed by the legislature.  
     
      
    75 In relation to the first matter, part 5.3 of the Criminal Code Act 1995, within which the relevant offences are contained, is based not only on the general legislative powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, but also on legislative powers referred by each of the States under s 51(XXXV) of the Constitution. As such, it is based on a scheme determined by the Parliament of the Commonwealth and the Parliament of every State. In that sense, it reflects the common will of the people of Australia through their elected representatives.  
     
      
    76 In addition, the seriousness with which the international community views terrorism offences is reflected in the number of international instruments which address the issue. The provisions of the Code in relation to terrorism offences give effect to Australia's international obligations as a signatory to a number of these instruments. They reflect a common world view that terrorism is a matter of international, not merely domestic, concern.  
     
      
    77 The background to the enactment of the anti-terrorism provisions contained in part 5.3 of the Code was explained by the Attorney-General in the course of the Second Reading Speech on 12 March 2002. This related to the provisions which were originally enacted. On that occasion the Attorney observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “(This bill) has been prepared in response to the changed security environment since September 11.  
        
       
      
      
       
        
        September 11 is a stark example of the horror and devastation that can be caused by acts of terrorism.  
         
         
        Terrorism has the potential to destroy lives, devastate communities and threaten the national and global economy.  
         
         
        For these reasons this government has affirmed its commitment to combating terrorism in all of its forms.  
         
         
        We join with the international community in condemning the 11 September attacks and other terrorist activities.  
         
         
        Other like-minded countries have passed, or are in the process of passing, anti-terrorism legislation designed to assist in this fight.  
         
         
        Consequently, counter-terrorism legislation and proposals throughout the world have been considered in the preparation of this Bill.” 
        
       
       
      
    78 It may safely be assumed the subsequent amendments to the terrorism legislation have been motivated by these or similar considerations, and by the impact of subsequent terrorist atrocities in various parts of the globe.  
     
      
    79 The first two counts (doing an act in preparation for a terrorist act, contrary to section 101.6(1) of the Code) each carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. The remaining two counts (possessing a thing connected with preparation for a terrorist act, knowing of that connection, contrary to s 101.4(1) of the Code) each carry a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    80 The broad purpose of the creation of offences of the kind involved in this sentencing exercise is to deter the emergence of circumstances which may render more likely the carrying out of a terrorist act. It is to punish those who contemplate action of the prohibited kind. It is to denounce their activities and to incapacitate them so that the community will be protected from the horrific consequences contemplated by their actions. The legislation is designed to bite early, long before the preparatory acts mature into circumstances of deadly or dangerous consequence. 
     
      
    81 There is an observation made by the Court of Appeal for England and Wales in R v Barot (2007) EWCA Crim 1119 at [45] which is germane to this discussion. There the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Terrorists who set out to murder innocent citizens are motivated by perverted ideology. Many are unlikely to be deterred by the length of the sentence that they risk, however long this may be. Indeed, some are prepared to kill themselves in order to more readily kill others. It is, however, important that those who might be tempted to accept the role of camp followers of the more fanatic, are aware that, if they yield to that temptation, they place themselves at risk of very severe punishment. Punishment is the other important element of the determination of the sentence for offences such as this.” 
        
       
      
      
       
      
    82 This observation was, of course, made in the context of terrorist activity designed to kill innocent people. It has a relevance, however, for terrorism in all its aspects.  
     
      
    83 It is essentially important to note that the terrorism legislation, relevantly for the present matter, is concerned with actions even where the terrorist act contemplated or posited by an accused person has not come to fruition or fulfilment. Indeed, the legislation caters for prohibited activities connected with terrorism even where no target has been selected, or no final decision made as to who will carry out the ultimate act of terrorism. There is a need, then, to consider what would have happened had the intending terrorist act or acts actually occurred. There is a commensurate need, in the present matter, to assess the offender's intentions, reflected both in his actions and by his plea, as to the type of activity necessarily contemplated by the preparatory acts, or by the acts of possession knowingly connected with a terrorist act or acts. 
     
      
    84 It will be necessary to ask the question: What do the facts, agreed as they are between the Crown and the offender, tell us as to those matters? In the light of the answers to that question, what then is the objective seriousness and gravity of the criminal conduct that falls to be punished by this sentencing exercise? Before answering these questions, I will turn to say something of the subjective circumstances of the offender and of the events that led him to engage in the activities which underpin the present pleas of guilty. I bear in mind however, that the offender falls to be punished, and his punishment assessed, solely in relation to the offences to which he has pleaded guilty, and not for the fear and detestation generated by terrorism generally. 
     
      
       
      The offender’s subjective circumstances 
       
      
    85 Many of the factual matters I will now turn to describe emerge from the report of a consulting clinical psychologist, Mr Peter Champion. He has interviewed the offender on one occasion only at the MRRC. This happened on 24 September 2008. The interview, however, together with some testing occurred, over a period of some four hours, and the resultant report, in the main, contains a thorough and helpful background to the offender's circumstances.  
     
      
    86 The offender is now a 28-year-old man. He has been in custody since the time of his arrest on 8 November 2005. He is classified as an AA prisoner although he is currently in strict segregation. (It is my understanding that AA segregation enables him to mix with those persons who were arrested at the same time he was and who still await the hearing of the conspiracy charge against them.)  
     
      
    87 The offender was born in Tripoli (Lebanon), the second of four children. His mother was of Lebanese descent, his father of Syrian descent, and both were of the Muslim faith (Sunni branch). It does not appear that, during his early childhood years, he was exposed to any of the violence which had occurred in Lebanon during the 1980s. He had a generally happy and unremarkable upbringing during his early years. The family came to Australia in about 1986, although his father did not accompany them, and has settled in Canada in more recent times. Despite the loss of his father in this sense, the offender enjoyed the support of his mother during his upbringing in Australia, and his relationship with her extended family. His childhood and earlier adolescence were again unremarkable and generally quite happy. He finished years 7 and 8 at De La Salle College at Ashfield. He then completed years 9 to 12 at Belmore Boys' High where he attained his higher school certificate, albeit with a rather modest TER. It appears that his interest in his studies had diminished somewhat by the end of his schooling. This may have been, in part, because many of his friends had left school, had started apprenticeships and were thus leading a freer life, with access to money and the enjoyment of material things. The offender told Mr Champion that his application to school work, by the time of the HSC, had not been particularly sound. It is to be inferred he was a reasonable student prior to this time. 
     
      
    88 After the offender left school, he began to associate with a range of ""sub-cultural peers"". (I took this to be a reference to young adults classically referred to as “dropouts”) He then began to use cannabis, in the end reaching a stage where he was abusing significant quantities of this drug, and was regularly substance affected. He remained, however, living at his mother's home and took up a number of apprenticeships, somewhat unsuccessfully. Later he commenced an apprenticeship as a painter, ceasing TAFE involvement after a time, and working as an uncertificated tradesman. It seems he was able to find ample work, even without the formal certificate.  
     
      
    89 The offender married when he was 20, his bride being 18 and of Greek descent (Orthodox faith). There were two sons born to the marriage, now aged five and six.  
     
      
    90 It seems that, although the offender was born into a family of the Muslim faith, they were not particularly involved in observing formal religious rites, attending the mosque on special occasions, that is, only a few times each year. At the height of his drug abuse, the offender was approached by a neighbour who encouraged him to address his drug problem. It was in that situation he began attending the Lakemba mosque, where there was a programme for individuals who were affected in the way he was by drugs or alcohol. According to the offender's account, there was a strong religious element involved in this treatment, but it was not of a political or religiously extremist bent. In any event, this encounter, and the encouragement of those who helped him, seemed to have achieved the desired effect. The offender returned to his employment, he had a stronger grasp of the tenets of his faith, and spoke of committing to his religion on a consistent basis, particularly once he had ceased using drugs. About this time, his wife converted to Islam and began to wear Islamic clothes. For the remainder of the year 2000, and into 2001, he led a ""normal, observant Muslim life-style"". (The offender’s uncle, who gave evidence, said that this adoption of a more radical religious life by both the offender and his first wife created something of a rift in the offender’s broader family). 
     
      
    91 It appears that the events of September 11, 2001 changed things radically for the offender. All the young Muslims at the mosque had begun to become embroiled in politics, arguing issues back and forth, this being encouraged by a number of the clerics. The offender told Mr Champion of a perception that he and all Muslims were at risk. He himself was abused and called ""Osama bin Laden"" and a ""terrorist"" by non-Muslim workers he encountered. At a more abstract level, the offender perceived the threat in terms of all Muslim people being under attack, where the ""war against terror"", as it was described, was translated by some Muslims into meaning a ""war"" against all Muslims. This notion, so far as the offender was concerned, was then reinforced by the invasions of Iraq and Afghanistan. He was an uncritical user of the Internet and other news sources, and this served to reinforce his attitudes concerning the threat and the need for action. 
     
      
    92 The offender spoke to Mr Champion about his becoming “radicalised”. He spoke of his religious faith taking on a much harder and more uncompromising edge. He spoke of the notion of ""violent jihad"" and regarded that as a response to the perceived threats to, and the persecution of, Muslims and the perceived discrimination against them within the Australian community. This led him to believe that he had an obligation as a Muslim to prepare to fight back, and to defend other Muslims. He spoke of having ""got stuck in the hype"" and ""influenced by the hype"", getting caught up in the agitation and emotions of the time.  
     
      
    93 It appears that the offender attempted to explain to Mr Champion some of the circumstances involved in the offending behaviour forming the sub-stratum of the offences to which he has pleaded guilty. In this context, he told Mr Champion that he believed there was a state of war, that Muslims throughout the world were at risk, and that there was a need to defend them and to confront the aggressors. He spoke of thinking that he would go to Afghanistan, but nothing came of this. He spoke of collecting a range of items he thought might be useful in a war situation (more particularly for sabotage) without any specific intent as to its use, following, in effect, what he believed others were collecting, yet not knowing what a lot of it was or how to use it. The offender further indicated that ""towards the end"" his interest had been waning to some extent, and that he was ""just going with the flow"" by the end, more particularly in the few months prior to his arrest.  
     
      
    94 As I have said earlier, he was arrested on 8 November 2005. Although I do not have any particular insight into this aspect of the situation, it seems that his wife was seriously affected following his arrest and incarceration, bail refused. His wife divorced the offender in 2008. The offender told Mr Champion that she seemed to have ""lost the plot"" on him, and that she suffered some type of ""nervous breakdown"", as a result of which she had handed over the care of the children to the offender's mother. The offender spoke of this whole episode with a measure of regret and perplexity, suggesting a residual affection for his ex-wife, though perhaps showing limited insight into the impact of his own situation on her circumstances.  
     
      
    95 The offender entered into a form of marriage in 2008 (essentially at a distance, and presumably by proxy) to the sister of a fellow prisoner who had suggested the match. His second wife was a divorced woman, having two sons aged two and five years. She was of Lebanese descent, and of the Muslim faith. The offender had met her during visits she made to him in prison. He told Mr Champion it was his intention, once released, to formalise their union and set up a home with his ""family"" and to return to work.  
     
      
    96 Mr Champion's report at (41) states: 
     
      
       
        
        “He indicated that he was now 'over it', and was taking a more balanced approach to his religion and the political views which flowed from that religion. He indicated that he no longer accepted the notion of violent jihad, in that while innocent people tended to get killed in war...he no longer believed that he should be involved in such things, or that indiscriminate killing was appropriate. Indeed he claimed that it had never been his intention to take human life, his recorded comments (as per the documents) being more in the form of arguing points of Islamic 'jurisprudence' as he had heard others do.” 
        
       
      
    97 (The Crown objected to the weight of the matters in this paragraph as the offender was not called to give evidence. I agree that little weight can be given to these statements in the circumstances where the accused did not himself give evidence of his present state of mind. The statements, for this reason, should be treated with considerable caution (R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353 per Smart AJ at [58]. Of more concrete value for the present exercise is the plea of guilty itself.)  
     
      
    98 Mr Champion conducted a number of tests in relation to the offender and made various assessments. He concluded that the offender demonstrated ""an uneven pattern of cognitive development"". He also reported that he could not exclude the possibility of a neurological contribution to the observed pattern of cognitive deficits. The individual tests provided ""a somewhat mixed picture"". The basic IQ scores gave a reasonable reflection of the offender's general functioning, that is slightly below average. There were a range of skilled deficits which were, however, atypical. On the arithmetic sub-test, the offender achieved quite a poor score, whereas on the verbal scale he demonstrated as being reasonably articulate, but with a lesser ability on a test of social awareness. The offender ""struggled with a test of verbal reasoning and with tests involving visuo-spatial construction”.  
     
      
    99 It was these poor results that gave Mr Champion cause to wonder whether there might not have been a possibility of brain injury resulting from a push bike accident the offender had suffered when he was ten years of age. Mr Champion confirmed, however, that there was no question of mental illness, psychosis or clinical depression. In addition, the offender appeared to be suffering no present problems as a consequence of his incarceration. Overall, Mr Champion saw the offender as a somewhat unsophisticated man, caught up in a form of religious fervour such as is not uncommon in those who convert or recommit to their faith. This process, he wrote, had been “exacerbated by his young age at the time and the real-world triggers which led to friction between Muslim and non-Muslim communities”. Mr Champion suggested there had been a moderation in some of his views since entering prison, and with his having time to think matters over. 
     
      
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    100 Detailed written and oral submissions were provided both by the Crown and by Mr Stephen Hanley, leading counsel for the offender. There was much agreement between the parties as to the stance the Court should take on a number of the issues arising on the sentence hearing. I shall acknowledge these areas of common agreement in due course.  
     
      
    101 The principal areas where there were differences were these: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) the gravity of the offence; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the nature and circumstances of the offence; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) whether reductions in the sentence should be allowed over and above the allowance generated by the plea itself (in general terms, both parties suggested that a proper discount for the plea in the present matter would be one of 25% on the basis that the plea represented a willingness to facilitate the course of justice.)  
        
       
      
    102 There was a general agreement between the parties that any sentences imposed should be ordered to be served concurrently. There was no substantial disagreement with the proposition advanced by Mr Hanley that the non-parole period required under s 19AG of the Crimes Act 1914 might be set at three-quarters of the sentence. These areas of commonality between the parties recognised, as they must, that any agreement between the parties could not, and should not, fetter the Court's discretion in relation to the sentences to be imposed. The areas of agreement, however, were reached only after very careful consideration, as is recognised in the detailed and thorough written submissions, provided to the Court. That, in itself, is a matter that commends the agreed matters to the Court. 
     
      
    103 It will be seen from these observations that one of the principal areas of contention is the assessment of the overall gravity of the offences. Allied to this is the need for the Court to properly assess the nature and circumstances of each offence. I shall now turn to consider these matters. 
     
      
       
      Objective criminality of the offences 
       
      
    104 The offender's submissions traverse the circumstances of each of the four offences with a view to assessing the objective criminality involved in each of them. The first offence (possession of ammunition), it was argued, did not fall within the ""worst case"" situation, and was not at the “upper limit” on any scale of objective seriousness. This was essentially because it was not possible to perceive, even in a rudimentary way, any plan establishing the primary object of the contemplated terrorist act. Secondly, the absence of a full variety of weapons found in the offender's possession should lead to the inference that his capacity to carry out any preparatory act was limited, as were the likely consequences of any proposed act. There was, for example, no weapon found in his possession that was capable of firing the type of ammunition he had collected in such voluminous quantities in June 2005.  
     
      
    105 The circumstances surrounding the second and third counts were also examined in detail. Mr Hanley argued that the evidence did not establish that it was ever the offender's intention to act with the primary purpose of endangering life. At best, his limited attempts to make an explosive device pointed no further than towards a proposal to cause injury to property. Secondly, counsel submitted that the attempts were limited in nature and in frequency. In addition, they were amateurish and ineffective. Thirdly, it was argued that the offender's cognitive and other skills were lessened to a degree by the limit of his intellectual capacity.  
     
      
    106 In relation to the fourth count, Mr Hanley submitted that the criminality revealed fell to be assessed as no higher than in the mid range of objective seriousness for such an offence. First, the material was readily accessible from the Internet and other sources. Secondly, the offender's extremist views were formed as a result of discrimination within the community, and emerged from a post 9/11 sense of isolation experienced and shared by many Muslim youths in the aftermath of the community's reaction to the events of that day. Thirdly, the offender's intellectual and cognitive deficiencies would probably have predicated him to such a response. Finally, it was submitted that there must be, in the light of Mr Champion's assessments, a question mark over the offender's ability to read, comprehend and conceptualise the large amount of extremist material he possessed.  
     
      
    107 Overall, Mr Hanley submitted that a comparison with the criminality revealed in R v Lodhi (2006) 199 FLR 364 would suggest that the criminality involved in the present offences, viewed as a whole, would be at a lower level. (The Crown, in support of its submission that an overall starting point for the sentence, prior to allowance for the pleas and other subjective matters, should be twenty-five years imprisonment, had suggested that the objective criminality involved in the present offences might be properly regarded as more serious than that revealed by the criminal behaviour examined in Lodhi's case).  
     
      
    108 In responding to the submissions made on behalf of the offender, it is necessary to make a number of general observations. First, the parties have agreed between themselves, correctly in my view, that the offender's criminal behaviour in relation to these four offences represents, and should be assessed, as one continuing course of criminal conduct. That concession will have obvious consequences for the structure of the sentences to be imposed for the individual offences. But it also has a consequence for the assessment of the level of criminality itself. 
     
      
    109 The more serious offences, obviously enough, are those set out in the first two counts. They each carry a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. They involve, as part of their statutory makeup, the notion that they are likely to be, in the usual course of events, closer to the implementation of a terrorist act than are the offences captured by counts 3 and 4. Indeed, the facts supporting the pleas made to counts 1 and 2 show this to be so in the present matter, even though a target or targets had not been selected. Thirdly, the criminal behaviour in relation to count 4 sheds considerable light on the intentions properly to be inferred from the actions relating to counts 1 and 2. A similar observation might be made in relation to the various discussions of an extremist nature captured by the listening device and telephone intercepts.  
     
      
    110 All of this material gives a significant and revealing insight into the intentions and beliefs held by the offender during the time he committed the offences in counts 1 and 2. They show that his views were deeply and firmly held. They demonstrate that he had espoused an obligation to carry out acts of violence, and that he approved of suicide bombings. They point to his belief that violence was justified, and that jihad and the killing of innocents was permissible and indeed, warranted in the name of religion. Finally, they plainly showed an intolerance towards non-Muslims, and a conviction on the offender's behalf that he personally should wage jihad against non-Muslims. It will be recalled that, during the discussion on 5 August 2005, he spoke of: 
     
      
       
        
        “An obligation on every Muslim to defend his faith, to fight for the religion of God against infidels.” 
        
       
      
      
    111 Of particular significance for a proper understanding of the offender's mindset and intentions during the relevant period in 2005 is the contents of some of the extremist material found in his possession. The detail is set out in annexure “A”, but the detail, sketched briefly as it is, gives a barely adequate picture of the content of the material when it is viewed. It seems to me that the material may adequately be described as falling into three categories, each of which is capable of impinging on the mind of the committed extremist in an ascending scale of dangerous intent. First, there are the images of Muslim people, often women and children, wounded or killed by the actions of United States soldiers and their allies. Images of this kind would be likely to inflame the committed Muslim viewer and ignite his or her anger at the actions of the enemy.  
     
      
    112 The second category of imagery shows military type explosions and the like, clearly in circumstances where the Americans and their allies were sustaining significant casualties at the hands of the insurgents. Images of this kind would be likely to promote an extremist pleasure in the victory of the insurgents over the enemy. 
     
      
    113 The third and final category is the gruesome and atrocious imagery of hostages being executed by the Islamists in the most terrible and brutal fashion. They include images of the actual beheadings of captives in sickening detail. No doubt, one intention of the display of images of this kind would be to desensitise the viewer, and to make him or her more readily able to take action against ""infidels"" in his own community. But a second clear intention is plainly to inflame the extremist viewer to a sense of jubilation and joy at the humiliating and degrading death of the enemy, viewed as an individual human being.  
     
      
    114 Final mention should be made of the ""practical"" training manuals found in the possession of the offender. These include detailed lessons on topics such as sniper training, field techniques, marksmanship and the like. In this context also the offender possessed much material of a general nature, discussing the need to establish an Islamic state and criticising the Americans and their allies.  
     
      
    115 Collectively, the material which was in the possession of the offender advocates a hatred of all those persons (Muslim and non-Muslim alike) who do not share extremist views. It propounds a detestation of democratic government and social liberalism. It propounds the notion that Muslims are obligated to pursue a violent form of jihad to undermine and overthrow liberal democratic societies and to replace them with Islamic rule and Sharia law. All these are the intentions and state of mind that I accept and find underlay the actions of the offender in acquiring ammunition, and in attempting to create an explosive device or devices. The presence of those intentions, and the existence of that state of mind, demonstrate graphically the serious character of the criminality involved, especially in relation to the offences pleaded to under counts 1 and 2.  
     
      
    116 These observations need to be tempered and moderated by the recognition that I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender ever intended, in committing the offences, to use the weaponry or explosive devices to directly bring about the loss of human life. Assessment of the objective seriousness of the criminality involved must, as a consequence, be confined to a generalised plan or intention on his part to damage, perhaps seriously damage, property. That said, it must also be observed that the detonation of a homemade explosive device always carries with it the possibility that human life will, or may be endangered, or at the very least threatened, in the execution of a plan to destroy or damage property. Bystanders and those in the vicinity may well be injured or killed. 
     
      
    117 I am unable to accept that the criminality involved, especially in relation to counts 1 and 2, is otherwise than at a very serious level. The conduct was both deliberate and sustained. The gathering and attempted gathering of the ammunition was carried out over a period of about five months. Considerable effort and thought went into the securing of the ammunition. Even after authorities had detected and seized fifteen boxes of the ammunition found in the offender's van on 3 June 2005, he later set about ordering further ammunition, using a form of code and by reliance on covert conversation, in an endeavour to avoid being found out. These covert attempts to avoid detection were clumsy in the extreme, but they demonstrated that the extremist intentions were still active, notwithstanding the June exposure.  
     
      
    118 While I accept Mr Hanley's submissions that the offender's attempt to make one or more explosive devices was both ham-fisted and amateurish, nevertheless the attempts he made showed that he was prepared to seek out and use the experience of others who might, because of their knowledge, help him to achieve his aims. Throughout most of the entire period, the offender clearly contemplated actions involving the detonation of one or more explosive devices, or the use of firearms, or both, and contemplated that actions involving this type of equipment would be threatened or perpetrated upon the Australian community. 
     
      
    119 It is clear that the possession of firearms and material capable of being assembled to make an explosive device placed the offender in a position where he would be, and was, closer to and better equipped to carry out, or provide assistance for the carrying out of, a terrorist act. The possession and acquisition of weaponry and other materials must be seen in that light.  
     
      
    120 A number of the matters relied on by Mr Hanley in the course of his careful arguments plainly need to be assessed and taken into account properly and carefully in the overall evaluation of the offender's criminality. But they are not, in my opinion, matters that would lead to the reductive significance sought to be placed on them in the presentation of the arguments.  
     
      
    121 First, in view of the nature of the statutory offences, the absence of a finally selected target does not significantly diminish the level of criminality. These offences are admittedly preparatory in nature, but the circumstances of their commission nevertheless establish a serious level of criminality.  
     
      
    122 Secondly, the fact that there was only one firearm found in the offender's possession in November 2005, and that it did not match the 7.62 by .39 mm calibre ammunition seized on 3 June 2005, does not significantly diminish the level of criminality. It is clear that the offender was able to access firearms by utilising the service of others (see the facts recorded in paras 36 - 38 above). In any event, the ammunition and other materials he acquired were available for others to use even if, in the ultimate, he did not make use of them himself. In that regard, I should briefly mention the report by Frank Lawton. This expert examined the material in the possession of the accused (counts 2 and 3) and concluded that some of the material could be used to make a small explosive device, and that other of the material could only be used to make an explosive device provided that there were an efficient means of initiation. So far as the handwritten note referred to in paragraph 63 is concerned, Mr Lawton thought that the items listed there could be used to make a crude explosive device, although other chemicals might be needed. This report confirms that the offender himself was, generally speaking, a rank amateur in the area of making explosives, but it does not rule out his use of other people, or the use by other people of the materials he assembled, for a terrorist purpose. His state of mind, his actions and intentions clearly embraced each of these possibilities. 
     
      
    123 The photographs in Exhibit “A” include crimped copper pipes, which could be used as the casing for an explosive. They include two 500 gram containers containing smokeless rifle powder. Conversations the offender had with his third party supplier in April 2005 showed that he was well aware that this latter material could be used as a component for an explosive. Indeed, it is quite likely that some of the material had been used in the attempts to make an explosive device. 
     
      
    124 The final matter I wish to address under this heading is the offender's cognitive ability. As I have said earlier, I am not satisfied that the evidence demonstrates that the offender had suffered any serious brain injury in his childhood accident. In referring to this incident, his uncle, Michael Yasseen, said that he had been told by the offender's mother that this accident, which occurred when the offender was about ten or eleven, resulted in his losing his front teeth and that he had a head injury, memory loss and was a bit slow in thinking. Mr Yasseen said that he had employed the offender as a painter and it is clear that his work was satisfactory in that regard. He did add that the offender could not ""comprehend a lot of things...it takes a while to grasp"". 
     
      
    125 On the other hand, Mr Champion's testing showed that the offender's overall testing score was in the middle of the low average range. The discordant results on some aspects of his testing raised a question mark in Mr Champion's mind as to whether there might have been some form of brain injury, but he did not conclude that there had been such an injury. The offender scored a sound result on tests in vocabulary development and general knowledge, although his ability to think things through when he did not know an answer was ""somewhat limited"". 
     
      
    126 It needs to be recalled that the offender had attained his higher school certificate, and that he appears to have done passably well at school until his last year or so, when he lost interest in his studies. It is true that he had suffered dizzy spells since his accident, but he reported that these were infrequent now, although they had not disappeared altogether. On the other hand, his drug use had been significant. It included regular ingestion of cannabis in considerable quantities (""stoned all day""), and included the use of cocaine, speed and ecstasy on a periodic basis throughout his late teens. All that ceased, however, by the time he was twenty. 
     
      
    127 Mr Champion accepted that the offender was not mentally ill. He accepted that he did not suffer from depression. At the most, the offender demonstrated an uneven pattern of cognitive development. It is necessary for the Court to give some weight to this material but I do not think that overall it diminishes or reduces, in any significant way, the serious level of criminality involved in the commission of the offences. 
     
      
       
      Pronouncement of sentence 
       
      
    128 I turn now to consider the sentence that should be imposed on the offender for these offences.  
     
      
    129 As I have found, the overall criminal culpability of the offender is at a high level. The Crown, however, has not suggested that these offences fall within the worst case situation. There is no suggestion by the Crown that, for example, a life sentence should be imposed in respect of either counts 1 and 2. On the other hand, the Crown has argued that a starting point for the appropriate sentence should be a term of imprisonment for twenty-five years. This, I think, is perhaps too high a starting point. But, in any event, as I will explain shortly, the selection of a nominal starting point is not desirable in assessing an appropriate sentence, having regard to the complexity of the present sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    130 Some of the Crown submissions may perhaps reflect the fact that originally the accused had been charged with a serious multi person conspiracy charge to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. It may well be true that, had the offender been found guilty of such a charge, and were the level of criminality in the overall conspiracy found to be sufficiently high, it would have warranted a very significant penalty, perhaps indeed even the imposition of the maximum penalty. That, however, is not the present position. Here the Crown has accepted pleas to the present four charges and has determined that it will not proceed against the offender in relation to the conspiracy charge. This offender, as I have said earlier, falls to be punished for the specific offences to which he has pleaded guilty in the light of the agreed facts and his subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    131 Nevertheless, the sentences to be imposed for each of counts 1 and 2 must be substantial so as to reflect the important principles of punishment, general deterrence and denunciation. I do not consider it appropriate, however, to select or nominate an “opening” figure as the Crown has suggested. Such a process may properly be said to raise the spectre of the approach criticised by the High Court of Australia in Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; [2005] 215 ALR 213 at [39]. Secondly, the Crown’s benchmark of comparison appears to have been the sentence imposed on Faheem Lodhi. The circumstances there, though similar, were not the same as revealed here. Moreover, the 20 year sentence imposed on Mr Lodhi was the end point of the sentencing exercise. It was not a nominated point of commencement. In terms of objective criminality, however, the present offences overall reflect a level of criminal seriousness that is certainly equal to, if not indeed somewhat higher, than that demonstrated in Lodhi.  
     
      
    132 What then is the effect of the plea and the other subjective circumstances required to be taken into account? As to the plea, the position in relation to sentencing for a Commonwealth offence in New South Wales is quite clear. The proper approach is to recognise the value of a plea of guilty by reference to the willingness of the offender to facilitate the course of justice. It is not appropriate to simply view the utilitarian value of the plea on the basis that it has saved the community the expense of a contested hearing (Tyler v R; R v Chalmers [2007] NSWCCA 247 at (110) and (111); R v Cameron [2002] 209 CLR 339 at (11) and following). Although it is not necessary to state a mathematical qualification for a discount allowed on this basis, there is, in my view, a need in the present matter to demonstrate transparency at least in that regard. 
     
      
    133 Both parties agree in the present matter that a discount of 25% should be allowed as representing an allowance for the offender's willingness to facilitate the course of justice. I agree with this proposition. I will explain my reasons for so agreeing. 
     
      
    134 First, it is common ground between the parties that the plea agreement in the present case was reached, and the pleas of guilty entered, at a relatively late stage in the pre-trial proceedings. Mr Hanley argued, however, that the plea was entered at the first available opportunity, in the sense that pleas were entered immediately after the presentation of a fresh indictment. Such a submission, however, is contrary to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v PB [2008] NSWCCA 109 at (30). A realistic view of the overall situation here must mean, as is clearly the fact, that the pleas of guilty were entered relatively late in the pre-trial proceedings. Those proceedings have been on foot since the end of February 2008.  
     
      
    135 On the other hand, the Court is entitled to take into account and acknowledge (as is agreed) that the first approach in this regard was made by the offender's (then) counsel at the conclusion of the committal proceedings in 2007. The offer made on that occasion was, however, rejected by the Director of Public Prosecutions. A fresh approach was then made to the Crown by leading counsel for the accused as early as February 2008. Subsequent discussions, and detailed negotiations, then took place over a period of some months, culminating in agreement being ultimately reached between the Crown and the offender for the proposed plea agreement.  
     
      
    136 It is also appropriate for the Court to note that an indirect but very real consequence of the offender's willingness to facilitate the course of justice is that the nature and prospective length of the trial involving the offender has been significantly curtailed. This would have been a trial of considerable length because of the number of witnesses to be called, and the number of exhibits to be tendered. The Court should reflect this in the allowance of a significant discount to recognise that the course of justice has well and truly been facilitated as a consequence of the subjective intentions of the offender as reflected in the plea.  
     
      
    137 Finally, in this regard, it is also necessary to note the conduct of the offender and his legal representatives during the pre-trial procedures in the conspiracy proceedings. These procedures have been both protracted and difficult, involving the Court in the delivery of in excess of fifty-eight decisions. The accused in the conspiracy trial were entitled to test aspects of the Crown case, and no criticism is presently offered in that regard. A willingness to facilitate the course of justice, however, is a broader concept than that of mere utilitarian benefit. It incorporates considerations that the plea of guilty facilitates not only the ultimate object of our system of justice, for example, sentence and punishment, but it also carries with it (or may do so) the avoidance of lengthy pre-trial hearings and matters of a similar kind. 
     
      
    138 It is to be noted that the offender's legal representatives, throughout the pre-trial period, have consistently taken a position that, unless indicated otherwise, evidence in relation to surveillance, voice identification or the occurrence of particular evidence could be led in the Crown case in short form. There were a number of concessions made by the offender and his lawyers during the pre-trial period that may properly be regarded as steps taken, short of a plea of guilty, to facilitate the trial in a real and commendable manner. Their conduct in this regard stood in marked contrast to the stance taken by a number of the other accused. These factors were further indications of a genuine and real intention on the offender’s part to facilitate the course of justice, even though they related to the conduct of the conspiracy trial.  
     
      
    139 All of the matters I have mentioned satisfy me that the Court is justified in allowing a full 25% discount in the sentencing of this offender. Although the strength of the Crown case is a permissible factor to be taken into account where a plea is relied upon as evidence of a subjective willingness to facilitate the course of justice, no submissions have been made by the Crown, however, requiring the Court to identify the strength or otherwise of the Crown case in the present matter. It is sufficient to say that the offender, through his counsel, notified the Court at the outset of the pre-trial applications of the likely nature of the defence case. He was not obliged to do so. There clearly was a genuine defence case for argument. In view of the fact that the Crown has made no submission in this regard, I do not propose to make any finding about the strength or otherwise of the Crown case. 
     
      
    140 The offender has argued that, in addition to the 25% discount, there should be a discount on sentence for a number of other specific matters. They generally fall into three categories. First, the offender has asked that a specific allowance be made for remorse, acceptance of responsibility and for his rejection of the beliefs that motivated the offences. Mr Hanley has argued that these matters should be recognised over and above the degree to which the pleas of guilty indicated a willingness to facilitate the course of justice.  
     
      
    141 Secondly, counsel argued that the difficult custodial situation of the offender, both presentence and following sentence, should warrant a further reduction in the sentence to be imposed. This was a reference to the fact that the offender has been in presentence custody as an AA classified prisoner. Moreover, he has spent some nine months of the last three years in segregation, quite apart from his AA classification. As well, it is a reference to the fact that the offender will be classified AA (or likely to be so classified) once he has been sentenced. This will mean that his terms of incarceration will be more onerous than that of a prisoner in the general prison population.  
     
      
    142 The third matter relates to the probable effect that any sentence may have on the offender's family or dependants. Prior to his arrest and imprisonment, the offender enjoyed a warm and close relationship with his wife and two young sons. He was the sole economic provider for the family. Since his imprisonment, the family has completely broken down and his wife has divorced him. This has led to her abandoning the children, who are now cared for by the offender's mother, a pensioner. Mr Hanley has argued that an allowance should be made for the impact of the likely sentence on his mother and his two sons in the future.  
     
      
    143 As to the first matter, I accept that an allowance can, in appropriate circumstances, be made over and above that given for the fact that the plea represents a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. An additional allowance can be made, in a proper case, for the presence of remorse, contrition, and other matters. It is important, however, that such an allowance does not have the effect of inappropriately “doubling up”, or merely repeating the allowance that has already been made. There is a plain overlap in some of these considerations. 
     
      
    144 In the present matter, I accept that some allowance can and should be made for the fact that the pleas of guilty may be taken, to a degree, to express remorse and acceptance of responsibility. Perhaps, even more importantly, the pleas of guilty may be taken, to some degree, to be a drawing back by the offender from the extremist beliefs that motivated the commission of the offences. There are two points I would make about this. First, care, indeed considerable caution, needs to be taken about such a matter. This is because the offender has not given evidence before me, and the present state of his mind has not been explored or tested in any way. There is, as I have said, a reference to it in Mr Champion's report, but this is a matter to which little weight can be given. 
     
      
    145 Secondly, the plea itself, may, however, be taken as a cautious indicator that the offender is in the course of relenting or moving away from his past extremist position. This is a particularly difficult area because it requires the Court to make a prediction about the future behaviour of the offender, in circumstances where there is very little to go on by way of hard evidence. On the other hand, the Court of Criminal Appeal, in Lodhi, made it clear that a significantly heavy sentence will be required to protect the community in a case where the Court is satisfied that a terrorist offender has not resiled from his previous extremist convictions. It must be the case that some allowance or recognition should be made where that is not the position. 
     
      
    146 At the very least, it can be said, in the present matter, that I am by no means satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender has refused to budge from his former extremist position. Rather, there is some reason to accept, having regard to the plea, that he has moved away from, or is in the process of moving away from, such a fanatical and extremist position. A moderate allowance, therefore, should be made to reflect remorse, contrition, acceptance of responsibility and the commensurate fact that, although the community may still require protection, this is at a lower level than might have been otherwise, were it not for the plea.  
     
      
    147 I turn then to consider the situation of the offender's incarceration both pre and post sentence. I examined the position of an AA offender in my remarks on sentence in R v Lodhi. There is no need for me to repeat those remarks here. It is possible, however, to predict that, in certain respects, the offender's time as a convicted person, AA classified, is likely to be more onerous than that sustained by a person in the general prison population. This is particularly so because the offender will not be able to mix among the general prison population, and there will be limitations on the recreations and enjoyments he will receive during his time in prison. He will not be able, for example, to receive any paid work. 
     
      
    148 The position, however, appears to me to be that the circumstances of AA classification may not currently be as onerous as I described or anticipated them in the Lodhi decision. Indeed, evidence before me as to the present position of Mr Lodhi in the Goulburn high security unit rather reinforces the fact that these conditions, although undoubtedly difficult, are not so onerous as to warrant any significant discount in the sentence. It appears that an AA prisoner, for example, does have regular rights of visitation, has the ability to make contact with people by telephone, has physical recreational facilities available, and can, in certain circumstances, undertake approved studies and courses. There are, of course, restrictions that go beyond those experienced by the general prison population, but overall, as I say, the position is not as onerous as it appeared to me to be several years ago. I propose to make a modest allowance, however, in the decision for the conditions of incarceration, and this will extend to the offender's presentence incarceration, particularly in relation to his periods of segregation. 
     
      
    149 I should add, finally, that the offender is segregated at present, but this is solely for his own protection and is to be reviewed quite shortly. The authorities acted cautiously when it was known that he was likely to plead guilty and placed him in segregation for that purpose. I should also mention that any presentence segregation has not occurred as a consequence of any untoward behaviour on the offender's part. Rather, it has been designed to protect him from violence or other recriminations emanating from elements in the general prison population. In any event, as I noted earlier, Mr Champion reported that the offender did not appear to be suffering any problems as a consequence of his incarceration. 
     
      
    150 The final matter is the position of the offender's family. Whilst I have considerable sympathy for his mother and two children, I do not think that any specific allowance can be made for this in the sentencing process, as the circumstances revealed by the evidence are by no means extraordinary or out of the usual. They reflect the unfortunate situation, commonly experienced, where a husband and provider is incarcerated because of his criminal conduct. 
     
      
    151 I now turn to consider the sentence to be imposed in relation to each of Counts 1 and 2. I leave to one side, for the moment, the discount for the plea. I have found that this should be allowed at a percentage of 25%. Taking into account the overall objective criminality involved in each offence, and making proper allowance for the subjective features I have examined, it is my view that, prior to discount, each count warrants the imposition of a sentence of 18 years and 9 months imprisonment. This means that, when the discount is allowed, the sentence for each of counts 1 and 2 should be (rounded-down) for a term of imprisonment of 14 years. The sentence in each case is to commence on 8 November 2005 and is to expire on 7 November 2019. 
     
      
    152 In relation to counts 3 and 4 in the indictment, an appropriate sentence in each case, in my view, is one of imprisonment for a term of eight years. The sentence in each case is to commence in each case on 8 November 2005 and is to expire on the 7 November 2013. 
     
      
    153 As will be apparent, all sentences are to be served entirely concurrently with each other. This structure of the overall sentence is intended to reflect the finding I have made that there was but one course of continuing criminal conduct involved in the commission of the offences. It is intended as well to reflect the totality of the criminality in all four offences. In my view, the criminality involved in each of counts 1 and 2 is sufficient to encompass the criminality of the remaining two offences. The principle of totality does not require me to inflict any additional punishment for those two offences.  
     
      
    154 Section 19AB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) requires that the Court fix a single non-parole period in the present circumstances. The purpose of the non-parole period is to provide a mitigation of the punishment of the offender in favour of rehabilitation through conditional freedom. The non-parole period, however, must itself incorporate all the relevant sentencing principles, including punishment, denunciation and general deterrence. 
     
      
    155 Following the enactment of s 19AG of the Crimes Act 1914, the Court is obliged, in relation to the present offences, to fix the single non-parole period at a percentage of at least three-quarters of the sentence. Where two or more sentences have been imposed on a person, the relevant percentage must relate to the aggregate of those sentences. This means in practical terms that the single non-parole period in the present matter must be, at the very least, for a period of ten years and six months. In my opinion, it is appropriate in the circumstances of this matter that the non-parole period be set at 75% of the aggregate of the sentences. It has not been submitted by the Crown that the Court should do otherwise.  
     
      
    156 The single non-parole period will commence on 8 November 2005 and it will expire on 7 May 2016.  
     
      
    157 Mazen Touma, in relation to the first charge in the indictment, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 14 years commencing on 8 November 2005 and expiring on 7 November 2019.  
     
      
    158 In relation to count 2 in the indictment, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment for 14 years. This sentence is to commence on 8 November 2005 and will expire on 7 November 2019.  
     
      
    159 In relation to the third charge in the indictment, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment for eight years. This sentence should commence on 8 November 2005 and expire on 7 November 2013.  
     
      
    160 In relation to the fourth charge in the indictment, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment for eight years. This sentence should commence on 8 November 2005 and expire on 7 November 2013.  
     
      
    161 The sentences in respect of counts 2, 3 and 4 are to be served concurrently with the sentence in relation to count 1, and with each other.  
     
      
    162 In relation to the four sentences, I fix a single non-parole period in respect of those sentences for 10 years and 6 months commencing on 8 November 2005 and expiring on 7 May 2016. 
     
      
       
      Explanation 
       
      
    163 I am obliged to explain to the offender the effect of the orders I have made.  
     
      
    164 Mazen Touma, the sentences I have imposed mean that you will be obliged to spend a minimum period in custody of 10 years and six months. You will be eligible for first release on the 7 May 2016.  
     
      
    165 It will be a matter for the Attorney-General as to whether you will be released on that day. That may depend upon your behaviour in prison. It will also be a matter for the Attorney General to determine whether any conditions should apply to you while you are at conditional liberty upon parole after the 7 May 2016. If you are released on that day, you will remain on parole for a further period of three years and six months. If you were to breach your parole, you may be required to return to prison to serve the balance of the term of your sentence.

   JUDGMENT1. On 13 December 2007 Mr Samadi was before the Court for sentence. On that occasion however there was no pre-sentence report. His matters were then stood over to 22 February 2008. On both occasions he had been before the Court it was at the District Court at Parramatta. He was then before the Court for sentencing in respect of four counts of robbery in company and two counts of intent to rob whilst in company. Hearing time ran out on 22 February and the matter was stood over for further hearing on 28 March 2008. For some reason the matter did not proceed that day but on 18 April 2008 it was in for mention to permit a change of representation by Mr Samadi. It was stood over for further hearing then on 13 June. There was again a change in lawyers with N A Lawyers taking over from Low Doherty and Strathford. That change was notified to the Court on 12 June 2008. It was stood over for mention before the list judge at Parramatta on 7 August 2008 and was before me again to finalise the hearing of the evidence and submissions on 17 October last, that is, last Friday. 2. On 29 March 2008, the day after the March hearing date, Samadi committed two further offences. These are before me by way of a Form 1. One is a further assault with intent to rob whilst in company, the other is a receiving charge. As a consequence of this last episode of criminality Samadi was refused bail after arrest. He has now been in custody since 5 April 2008. There has been a 10-month delay from the commencement of Mr Samadi’s journey through this Court. Such a delay is unusual unless the delay is one authorised by s 11 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. However the delay has been occasioned by adjournments sought by the offender. Regrettably during this delay he has offended again. I shall return to the significance of that later. Today Safi Samadi is to be held accountable for his criminality. 3. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for these offences before this court committed by this offender harming these victims in this community. (R v Gladue (1999) 1SCR 688 [80]) 4. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender, subjective matters. The starting point for such assessment requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender. The offender's rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. 5. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, and what is to be made of the Form 1 matters. Finally of course the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment or other penalties to be imposed will need to be determined. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined. (See R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby (1977) NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740) 6. Samadi’s offending falls into four discrete episodes covering the period from 17 August 2006 to 7 November 2007 and a fifth episode on 29 March 2008.Facts7. The facts as tendered by the Crown, whilst not signed as agreed facts, in respect of the matters occurring in 2006 have not been challenged by the defence. The hearing has proceeded as though the matters are not in issue. However the offender did challenge at least one fact relating to the matters on the Form 1. His challenge is that he was not the author of a conversation, which gave him a leading role in the attempt robbery set out in the Form 1. Nonetheless he did not seek to withdraw his request that I deal with the matter. I intend to deal with it on the facts before me assuming those facts originated from the victim. 8. The first offence that I deal with is the assault with intent to rob whilst in company against Benjamin Ling. That offence occurred about 3.20pm on 17 August. Ben Ling a seventeen year old and his friend Vineet Gorolay were walking home from their high school situated in Felton Road Carlingford. In the lane behind Carlingford railway station the offender, in the company of five other males, approached Ling and Gorolay from behind. The offender said to Ling “My friend wants your phone”. Ling ignored the male and the two continued walking. The accused is said to have been wearing an earring, dark T-shirt and jeans. Four of the males, including the accused, surrounded Gorolay and the other two males stood with Ling blocking his access to Gorolay. One male attempted to take Ling’s mobile phone from his pocket but was “stared down by the victim” and was not successful. The six males then converged and faced Gorolay and Ling. Ling was facing Gorolay when the leader of the group demanded from him “Give me your money you cunt, you fuck” then stepped towards Ling and hit him to the left side of the face with a closed right fist. Ling felt a shock to the left side of his face and stared at the group. 9. The group began to move away towards they railway station and Gorolay rang the police using his mobile phone. The males then ran towards the railway station. Ling identified the offender on 8 March 2007 by way of a slide show of photographs presentation. Ling described the group as consisting of teenaged Middle Eastern males and claimed that he recognised the leader as having worn a Cumberland High School uniform prior to and after the robbery. Ling said that prior to the offence he had seen the offender frequently in the company of the leader of the group walking to school together. Ling said he had also seen the offender in a Cumberland High School uniform. Ling said that he had seen the offender after the incident around the same area on a number of occasions.10. I now deal with the robbery in company offence on 3 November 2006. about 9.20am on 3 November 2006 Zachary De Gooyer and his girlfriend seventeen year old Jessica Taylor were walking on Felton Street towards the Carlingford railway station to catch a bus for a school excursion. The offender was observed by Taylor to be wearing a green polo shirt and full length black and white camouflage cargo pants. De Gooyer and Taylor approached the vicinity where the offender was. The offender said to them “Do you have any money?”. De Gooyer said “No”. The offender said “Let me check” and put his right hand on the victim’s left shoulder as though to stop him from walking further. De Gooyer realising he was being robbed felt scared and threatened. A second Middle Eastern male of teenage years joined the offender. De Gooyer removed his wallet and opened it revealing $25 inside. The offender said “Give that to me”. In response De Gooyer handed over the $25. The other male then patted De Gooyer’s left pocket and felt his mobile phone. The other male asked “What’s that?”. De Gooyer showed him the mobile phone. The second man said “Give that to me”. De Gooyer surrendered the mobile but was permitted to keep his SIM card. De Gooyer was told by the second male to walk in the other direction for five minutes, then you can go where you want. De Gooyer and his girlfriend walked a short distance, turned around, observed the two offenders running with three other males.11. The next three matters are all robbery in company and all occur at the same time and place. The victims were all students from Carlingford High. On 7 November 2006 somewhere around 3.10pm. Lindsay Cluff a sixteen year old caught her school bus, alighted from it at the corner of Jenkins and Pennant Hills Roads Carlingford. There she met thirteen year old Regan McDougall and walked down Jenkins Road where they were joined by Timothy Cluff, a fourteen year old. Three Middle Eastern teenage boys walked by. Two of them were wearing white school shirts and grey trousers and carrying cricket bats. The offender who was with them was wearing a red T-shirt and carrying a golf club. All of the males walked past the victims and to a different street. Shortly however they returned to the victims. One male took hold of McDougall by the shirt to bring the victims into a group and then the three males stood around those victims. One male demanded wallets or money from the victims. Lindsay Cluff said “C'mon man you don’t want to do this”. The male patted Lindsay Cluff down. Removed her mobile phone from her left pocket. He returned the SIM card from the phone to her but kept the phone. The male said “C’mon man I don’t want to have to hit you, where’s your wallet?”. The other male and the accused were saying similar things and the accused was holding his golf club up and the other male his cricket bat up.12. This offender tapped the outside of Timothy Cluff’s pockets and removed $40 from one of those pockets. He tapped Timothy Cluff’s pockets again and heard coins rattling and asked “How much is this?”. Young Cluff replied “Three bucks”. The offender said “I’ll take that as well” removing those coins from Cluff’s pocket. Regan McDougall removed his wallet from his pocket and handed $20 to the first male. That male said “I’ll take this too”. He then reached into McDougall’s wallet and removed a $10 note. McDougall then handed to him coins from his wallet totalling $3.00 approximately. One of the males said words to the effect “not to go to the police or they would be back”. The victims walked away and the males ran away. The victims phoned police. All three victims felt threatened and shocked at the time of the offences. They felt that the bats and clubs were being held in a threatening manner. 13. Sequence seven and eight on these facts appear to occur five minutes later than the last, lot but I note the charge sheets have these offences occurring before. In a sense, they not being completed robberies, it makes more sense that these offences probably did occur before. For my part I will regard them as occurring at about 2.45pm. At that time fourteen year old Daniel Barabas and fifteen year old Chris Cooper, who were students at Carlingford High School were alighting from a school bus on the corner of Pennant Hills and Jenkins Roads Carlingford. Three Middle Eastern teenagers shouted to them to stop and then surrounded them so that they could not get away if they wanted to. The male, which the victims of this attempt robbery describe as the leader, was wearing a white Cumberland High shirt holding a cricket bat, as was a second male; this offender was holding a golf club. The apparent leader asked if they had mobile phones money iPods. Cooper replied “No”. The leader felt the victims’ pockets and the victims opened their wallets to demonstrate there was no money in the wallets. The leader asked if the victims had anything in their bags and the victims showed their bags. At this point other Carlingford High School students were walking down the street. The leader then said “Go, get out of here”. He then said that they were only joking and offered to shake the victims’ hands or pat them on the back. The victims quite rightly ignored that overture and walked away. They were scared and intimidated because the males were holding cricket bats and golf clubs. They felt that if they did not comply with the demands that the bats and golf club might be used.14. On 3 November 2006 Sergeant Lofts, who had dealings with the accused in relation to matters that were unrelated, alluded that the accused was wearing a green T-shirt and camouflage pants. A Samsung mobile phone was booked into police custody and released to the accused later. That is the date on which the sequence 3 occurred. On 3 November police arrested the accused and seized a Samsung mobile phone, black and white camouflage pants and green T-shirt. 15. On 8 November the offender made admissions to participating in the offences. He also admitted to wearing seized items of clothing at the time of sequence 3, admitted the Samsung mobile was a stolen phone from the sequence 3 offence. He expressed remorse in relation to the commission of these offences. So that that may be understood the sequence 3 offences, the offence on 3 November 2006.16. As I said there were then two offences that occurred on 28 March this year. In this case Yui Lam Chan was walking home from a train station at Carlingford at 11.15pm. Two males both holding twenty centimetre long metal rods, described as being the same width as a ruler, confronted him. One, who is said to be the offender said, “do you know what we are going to do now, we’re going to rob you?” The victim screamed “No.” The offender grabbed the victim and grabbed the victim’s bag on his back. The victim ran across the road. Male two, that is to say the male who did not demand the money, ran across the road after Chan. He then hit Chan some ten times with the metal rod causing injuries to him. Chan dropped his wallet and that second male picked it up. Chan walked back across the road, meanwhile the offender met up with the unknown robber. They walked away. 17. At some stage shortly after this the unknown robber gave the proceeds of the robbery, that is to say the wallet and the entirety of its contents, to the offender. The victim’s wallet contained various personal cards, house keys, a fifty dollar note, bus tickets and two mobile phone SIM cards. The basis of the 97 assault with intent to rob in company offence is, that at the point in time when the offender said “don’t chase, don’t chase” he exited himself from the robbery. When he and the unknown man met up shortly after and the offender was given the wallet and its contents, his criminality was of a different nature and that is the basis of the s 188 offence. 18. At about 2.40am the following morning, that is on 29 March, Chan’s wallet containing certain property was located in a search of a vehicle in which this offender and one Mohammad Nasri were found sitting, parked outside Nasri’s residence. The vehicle in which they were sitting is registered to the offender’s address under his mother’s name. The wallet was located in the passenger footwell. The offender was in the driver seat and Nasri in the passenger seat. Missing from the wallet was fifty dollars, bus tickets and one of the mobile SIM cards. As a consequence of his involvement in that offence he was arrested on 5 April and charged. He has been refused bail. No co-offender has yet been charged. Objective Criminality19. I turn now to the objective criminality. From the facts as he finds them to be a sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences before the Court as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of an offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant offences with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. 20. Justice Gleeson when Chief Justice of New South Wales encapsulated the essence of legal wrong done by robbers and would-be robbers and the reason why substantial punishment is required in R v Rause unreported NSWCCA 8 August 1992. The Chief Justice said:  
     
      
      “One of the primary purposes of the system of justice is to keep the peace. In this connection the idea of peace embraces the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk the streets and go about their daily affairs without fear of physical violence. It also embraces respect for the property of offences. Offences of the kind committed by [present accused] are not trivial instances of disrespect of private property, they are serious breaches of the peace. They are direct attacks upon the security of the person and property which the law exists to protect.” 
       
      
     His Honour said: 
     
      
      “It is quite likely that this young man does not understand and he may never understand the seriousness of his antisocial behaviour but the courts understand it. Crimes of this kind ... deserve severe punishment.”  
       
      
    21. Each of these offences was an offence of serious personal violence towards another human being. Robbery constitutes a crime against both the person and a person’s property or property rights. The crime against the person is constituted by putting that person in fear through threat or actual violence to such a point that he surrenders against his will, property to the robber. In this case the offender secured the advantage for his violence by relying upon the presence of other persons expressing malice towards his victims. It was the force of numbers by which his victims’ will was overcome, in a number of offences and in some of the later offences, not only by force of numbers but also by presence of cricket bats and a golf club.22. Although not stated in terms, all of the victims of the 2006 offences appear to be high school students. It is unclear so far as Chan is concerned whether he was a student or not. At 11.15pm it is not likely. But so far as the students appear, the eldest appears to be seventeen years old, the youngest thirteen years. At least two of the victims were young teenage girls. School children are entitled to come and go from school free from threat of violence by gangs of youths preying upon them. I find these acts of robbery and assault committed particularly on 7 November, that is, assault with intend to rob, were predatory in nature. 23. While the accused does not appear to be the leader I am satisfied he did take a prominent part in all of the robberies. The offences occurring on 7 November are but minutes apart from each other. On this occasion the accused was armed with a golf club. Some at least of his co-offenders were armed with cricket bats. I am satisfied these items were being deliberately carried as weapons to provide threat of force per medium of the weapon as well as threat of force by numbers.24. That threat of force per medium of weapon in these cases provides aggravation of the criminality over and above the criminality that derives from use of force of numbers to terrorise the children. I should indicate there is no evidence other than the presentation of the weapons that satisfies me they were used. In respect of the matter on the Form 1 the weapons were metal rods the width of a ruler. That would be roughly I would imagine an inch or so thick. They were twenty inches long. In fact, the criminality of its use is not attributed to the accused, one of them was used in robbing Chan.25. The very fact that they are present makes more likely the fact that they may be used. It justifies in that sense the fear felt by the children on 7 November that they might be used. 26. On 3 November 2006 this offender was charged with shoplifting. It is unclear from the evidence whether he was charged before or after the robbery committed on 3 November. What is clear is that the offending on 7 November was done at a time after he had been charged but before that matter had been finalised. What though is not clear is whether he was on bail on shoplifting charge or whether bail had been dispensed with.27. The Local Court though placed Mr Samadi on eighteen month good behaviour bond for offence of violent disorder on 27 March 2007. That bond was current and binding on him in March of 2008. Further, Samadi was on bail in respect of the matters before me. That bail had been continued the day prior to his offending on 28 March. This offending is aggravated by virtue that he breached an undertaking to be of good behaviour that he made to the Local Court. It is also aggravated by his breach of bail undertaking that he would not commit any offences whilst on bail. 28. There are no victim impact statements before the court in these matters but I am satisfied these offences caused fear and trauma to his victims. I am also satisfied that sense of trauma lasted beyond the incident. However in the absence of specific evidence I cannot say the sense of trauma or upset lasted beyond the day of its occurrence. The proceeds of the robberies that were accomplished included small sums of money and a mobile phone. While the robberies may have been opportunistic in the sense that victims needed to be present before the gang pounced I have already noted they were predatory. I should also note there was some modus operandi about it. They appear to occur near a school or pathway to a school or railway station where students are likely to be found. With the exception of the offence on 29 March last they targeted students, all were committed whilst in company. The last offence, the Form 1 offences, does not appear to have been committed against a school child on his way to or from school. Clearly they are offences that call for incarceration. Subjective circumstancesBackground, relationships and family dynamics 29. Samadi is a single man aged twenty years. He was eighteen at the time of these offences. Indeed the first offence occurs nine days after his eighteen birthday. He is the youngest of five siblings. All his siblings are sisters. His natural parents’ relationship has remained intact. He is a native of Afghanistan. The first half dozen to nine years or so were lived in Asia. As I gather the first half dozen in Kabul. He carries memories of an extended family from that period. During these years he witnessed acts of war and experienced loss from war in that his cousin was killed in circumstances where he was close by, his mother was beaten by Taliban, resulting in permanent injury to her back.30. He saw damaged and bombed buildings, blood on walls where people had been confronted and either killed or belted. He felt frightened and unsafe as a child. His family fled the war initially as refugees to Pakistan and subsequently to Australia. Conditions as a refugee in Pakistan were harsh. Hs family was poor and disadvantaged. In Australia the family environment was warm, stable and supportive. He is still receiving support from his family. His mother is still plagued with back problems that incapacitates her to the extent that her husband is her caregiver. Neither of those have been able to get to Court. Two of his sisters supported him when he attended appointments with Miss Katie Seidler, a forensic psychologist, who reviewed him for the defence. 31. His brother-in-law is married to one of the sisters and is also supportive. He gave evidence in support of the offender on two occasions. The brother-in-law is a partner in Primo Smallgoods who with his partner gave employment to the offender in January 2008. There is evidence before the Court that he will be re-employed upon his release. At the present time Samadi has no romantic relationship. His parents and all three sisters have written letters to me in support of him.Education, skills and employment32. Testing by Miss Seidler established this offender’s non verbal or performance intelligence is superior to only nine per cent of the population. Much of his education and employment history necessarily needs to be reconciled with this assessment. In Afghanistan and Pakistan his early primary school education was also compromised because of war and refugee circumstances. He attended several years of primary school in Pakistan. Without any academic or behavioural concerns he arrived in Australia in time to commence Year 5 in primary school. Even with English as a second language support, adjustment was difficult.33. In secondary school his behaviour deteriorated. He was suspended from school, distracted at school, truanted school. He was asked to leave in Year 9. He complained to Miss Seidler that at nineteen in 2006 he was several years older than his classroom peers in the school certificate. The problem with this account is that gives a birth date of August 1988 making him then either seventeen or perhaps eighteen in 2006. Even so I do accept that he was several years older at that age than other school certificate pupils. I mention the point to illustrate he is not a good historian. 34. He started three TAFE courses. Abandoned each of those courses. His sister claims he has obtained work as a cleaner but was reticent to attend. At Primo he worked in the warehouse as a storeman, was found to be slow but persevered and those employing him persevered. Ultimately he was regarded as satisfactory. He did some training in carpentry through his contact with Mission Australia, an employment agency. General health35. Samadi is a tall, slim, twenty year old man. He does not appear to present with any general health ailments. Nor, however, does he appear to be particularly physically fit. He sits in Court with his head bowed for most of the time. At what level he is taking in events in the courtroom it is difficult to assess.Mental Health Issues36. Samadi gives a history of breathing difficulties at times. There is some suggestion, although no firm diagnosis, that these symptoms may be associated with anxiety and possibly panic episodes. There is also history of sleeping difficulties and nightmares for the past eighteen months or so. Reading through Ms Seidler’s reports it is likely Samadi lacks the capacity to be a fulsome, relevant or articulate historian.37. Much of the pertinent information comes from his siblings. That must make any diagnosis problematic. In the first report Ms Seidler said: 
     
      
      “According to Mr Samadi, he was raised within a stable and supportive family environment through which he was not exposed to any notable risks. However his developmental experience was compromised by spending his early years living in Afghanistan where he was exposed to the ongoing consequences of war. It is possible that this was quite traumatising to Mr Samadi as evidenced by a possible history of panic disorder in childhood. Moreover these experiences may still effect Mr Samadi in terms of his alleged sleep disturbance and fearfulness of a night-time.” 
      
    After the second consultation, Ms Seidler’s opinion was: 
     
      
      “...Samadi’s offending behaviour can be conceptualised as the end result of a complex process of development risk. Mr Samadi was exposed to severe trauma as a child from being raised in a war-torn and violent community and this left him an emotionally and socially vulnerable child who was forced to leave his country and adjust to the demands of living in a new environment where he did not speak the language.  
       
       
      Further to this Mr Samadi is a low functioning individual intellectually. This compromised his ability to cope with these changes as well as engage in and profit from schooling. Unfortunately however given the cultural meanings around school and success Mr Samadi felt unable to discuss his concerns openly with his family and rather he withdrew from his family and from school and he appears to have drifted in an aimless routine whereby he has shied away from positive goals that it is likely Mr Samadi felt unable to achieve.  
       
       
      Further to this, given his other vulnerabilities, Mr Samadi drifted into a negative peer group of similarly disaffected youths where he found a sense of belonging and identity. However, as a result of Mr Samadi’s limited intellectual skills and social naivety, he felt unable to assert himself with these people and rather followed their direction even when this involved criminal behaviour. 
       
       
      In summary Mr Samadi’s offending is understood as the unfortunate actions of a low functioning, socially disadvantaged and disaffected youth who lacks the assertiveness and social skills to stand up to people who have taken advantage of him and placed him at risk, including encouraging his involvement in antisocial behaviour.” 
       
      
    Zakiahmed Giary gave evidence the offender had visited a psychologist [sic] Dr Pashyar who he had visited more than the half a dozen times allowed by Medicare. Regrettably no report from this practitioner has been tendered. In her second report, Ms Seidler seeks to make a causal link between the offender’s behaviour and his intellectual, environmental and mental health background.38. She speaks of him “drifting” into a negative peer group. His family speak of him choosing that group over and above his family. A choice causing some tension in the family. She also speaks of him “following their directions”. From the facts of the offences reviewed, it is quite clear although not the leader, he takes a prominent role. In fact in at least two that spring to mind, he is the one who made the first demand. 39. It is not without significance that in the last offence, the Form 1, he is the sole beneficiary of the robbery committed by his co-offender. That result does not sit well with a suggestion “he followed their direction”.Drugs and Alcohol40. Samadi gives a history of having no issues with drugs and alcohol. My reading of Ms Seidler’s report gives me an impression she has little confidence in the reliability of the offender on either of these topics. I am not sufficiently confident to make any finding in respect of the offender’s use or abuse, whichever be the case, of drugs or alcohol. Criminal History41. The offender is a young man of twenty with significant intellectual deficits. He feels more comfortable associating with youths younger than he. He feels more accepted belonging to a gang. Within this group he is able to secure an identity that is not so readily available in the community. No doubt at the urging of his family he has made some attempts to find employment from carpentry, cleaning and ultimately a storeman. Those supporting him say that in the last position, although a little slow, he was making good progress. Regrettably whilst in this position he committed his last offence.42. The offender presents with a minimal past criminal history. I have already referred to the shoplifting charge which was laid on the day of the second offence and the violent and disorder matter which appears to have occurred after the November 2006 episodes of criminality but before the March 2008 offences. 43. His past offending, subject to my earlier observations, given both its timing and the Local Court’s penalties, does not constitute any real basis for denying leniency to the offender for the August and November 2006 criminality. I have already noted however the aggravating features arising from the existence of the shoplifting charge and the breaches of bond and bail.Circumstances Motivating the Offences44. There is a real difficulty determining what motivated the offender’s participation in the offending conduct. He was found in possession of the mobile phone taken in August of 2006. He was given all the proceeds of the robbery on 29 March. That would suggest it was not simply a case of reacting to peer pressure. It would appear there was some gain to him. Attitude to the Offence45. Attached to exhibit A there is a letter of apology written ten days after the offences committed in November of 2006. In that he says: 
     
      
      “I know and understand that what I did was not only wrong and shameful but also unacceptable through the eyes of the law and the public alike. I can only hope and wish that these few words can take some of the anger and hurt out of the heart of those who I have betrayed and hope it will at least heal some of the emotional scarring.” 
       
      
    Samadi finished that letter declaring a firm intention, “I will never do wrong again.” 46. In evidence last week he told the court that as a result of his incarceration he now knows more about life and has a clear understanding of what is right and wrong. Again he reiterated that he would not do anything criminal again. He has been studying religious training. Whilst in custody his relationship with his family has improved. He has written to his parents from custody for Father’s Day and Mother’s Day and written to his nephew Sam. He indicated he would not be “hanging around” with the “wrong crowd” any more. 47. While I accept his contrition as sincerely felt at the moment and in the circumstances in which he finds himself, I am far from confident this remorse will impact upon his conduct once outside the gaol gate. Rehabilitation Prospects48. Samadi’s rehabilitation prospects are cloudy. So far as the positive rehabilitation indicators are concerned, he has strong family support and interest. He has been willing to discuss his offending with family members and is able to express regret and an intention of reforming to them. He appears to have insight into why his offending conduct amounts to criminal conduct. He has a past history of some interest in employment and is being assisted and encouraged by family to accept employment in a family-connected business. And he is giving some focus to positive post-custodial plans. 49. But on the other hand his pattern of offending has seen him offending over a two-year period. His past attempts at rehabilitation had been unsuccessful. He returns to seek company of antisocial associates. There are concerns as to whether he is fully disclosing any addiction-type problems. He has offended even when restrained by court orders requiring his good behaviour. He is likely to be a concrete thinker with limited capacity to reason or make a value judgment when confronted with antisocial choices.Plea Status50. He has pleaded guilty to all matters from the outset. His pleas are motivated by the contrition I spoke of and a willingness to be held accountable for the criminal conduct. I intend to allow a twenty-five per cent discount for his early pleas. Setting the Sentence51. The offences are all offences requiring for reasons which will become apparent shortly, an ingredient of deterrence notwithstanding his young age. In Australian society there is very extensive raft of criminal laws passed by federal and state parliaments. The chief purpose of the criminal law put in place by parliaments is to deter those tempted to breach its provisions. Parliament does that by prescribing penalties for those who engage in conduct prohibited by the criminal law.52. Consequently, when a person is sentenced for a breach of the criminal law, he is exposed to the possible maximum penalty provided by the statute breached. In this case the maximum penalty for the statute breached, insofar as the robbery and attempt robbery charges are concerned, is one of twenty years imprisonment.53. Sentencing for breaches of the criminal law requires the sentencing judge to keep in mind those general deterrence aims of the criminal law for the community at large by keeping in mind that maximum penalty available and its deterrent purpose. There is also a specific deterrence aimed at individuals likeminded to this offender who but for such deterrence would be willing to commit crimes similar to those for which this offender is being sentenced. Finally there is a component of deterrence to be considered personal to an offender with a view to deterring him or her from re-offending.54. I said that I would need to take the Form 1 matter into account in the third charge. The effect of that will be to drive the sentence for that third charge upwards. The chief justice speaking for the Court of Criminal Appeal in a guideline judgment relating to Form 1 matters, The Attorney General Application under S 37 Crimes (Sentence Procedure Act) 1999 (2004) 61 NSWLR 38 made clear the rationale for the increase in penalty. He said:  
     
      
      “The court does so by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence which the commission of those other offences will frequently indicate ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused engaged. 
       
       
      The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences which...are offences for which no [isolated] punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence.” 
       
       
      
    55. R v Henry and Ors (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 is a guideline judgment that authority establishes is clearly a matter that I must take into when sentencing for these offences. Many of the features discussed in Henry are present here: 
     
      
      “(i) Young offender with little or no criminality 
       
       
      (2) Weapon (like a knife), capable of killing or inflicting serious injury” - 
      
    (in this case the weapons present, when they were present, were cricket bats and a golf club) 
     
      
       
      “(iii) Limited degree of planning 
       
       
      (iv) Limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof 
       
       
      (v) Victim in a vulnerable position such as a shopkeeper or taxi driver 
       
       
      (vi) Small amount taken 
       
       
      (vii) Plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited to a strong Crown case.” 
       
      
    56. R v Henry CCA (1999) 46 NSWLR 340 was determined before the guideline judgment on plea discounts R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. The Henry guideline reflects the jurisprudence then applicable to pleading guilty. Note, “The plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.” My view is that the Thomson & Houlton guideline judgment resulted in a far more favourable benefit for a guilty plea based upon a utilitarian value of the guilty plea and quantified up to usually for an early plea, all other things being equal, of twenty-five per cent. 57. It is safe to accept the sentences that underpin the Henry guideline range were touched by the general oversight acknowledged in Thomson & Houlton of insufficient discounts for pleas of guilty prior to that judgment which I think was in 2003. Regrettably no modification was ever sought to Henry guideline as a consequence of Thomson & Houlton guideline. 58. There is other jurisprudence to be taken into account when sentencing a person who was young when offending. It is to be remembered this offender, whilst strictly at law an adult, was but eighteen when most of the offending occurred. It is a well accepted principle of sentencing that generally when sentencing a young person issues of general deterrence and public denunciation will play a subordinate role to the need to have regard to the individual treatment and to rehabilitation.Qualification to this principle was summarised by Justice Hunt, CJ at C.L. in R v James Anthony Morris NSWCCA 25 September 1995 when he said: 
     
      
      “Where a youth conducts himself in a way an adult might conduct himself and commits a crime of considerable gravity, the function of the court to protect the community, requires deterrence and retribution to remain significant elements in sentencing him”. 
      
    The Court of Criminal Appeal in R v AEM snr- [2002] NSWCCA 58 noted: 
     
      
      “True it is ... that the courts consistently point out the need to give young offenders a chance and to refrain from sending them to gaol or dealing heavily with them if that course can be avoided. However there is a point at which the seriousness of the crime committed by a man of nineteen, even though a young man, is of such a nature, is so great, that that the principle in the public interest give way”. 
       
      
     There is an earlier case of Pham (1991) 55 A.Crim.R. 128, which says:“It is true that courts must refrain from sending young persons to prison unless that course is necessary but the gravity of the crime and the fact that it is a crime of violence frequently committed by persons even in their teens must be kept steadfastly in mind otherwise the protective aspect of the criminal court’s function will cease to operate. In short, deterrence and retribution do not cease to be significant merely because persons in their late teens are persons committing grave crimes”. 
     
      
    59. I have come to a view that particularly because of the quantity of criminality exhibited in these offences substantial sentences of imprisonment are required. It is never easy to sentence a young man to a custodial sentence. S 5 of the Crimes (Sentencing Proceedings) Act provides that the Court should not do so unless it is the only appropriate penalty. There are cases, and this is one of them, where not to do so would be to fall into clear appealable error. The youth of this offender is particularly relevant though, to the determination of the relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence and despite the significance of deterrence and the need to protect the public, youth is still relevant to the assessment of overall criminality, bearing in mind s 21A(3)(j) of that Act and the observations of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Hearne (2001) 124 A.Crim.R. 451. 60. Likewise the intellectual capacity of the accused is a matter requiring mitigation of the deterrence aspect of sentencing. That mitigation may impact both upon the overall sentence and the minimum term, or put another way, it is also properly a factor to be taken into account in determining special circumstances. As I said earlier this offender has been in custody since his arrest on 4 April 2008. Sentencing61. Now all that remains after those remarks is to impose the sentences to be imposed. Mr Samadi would you stand up please? This may take a bit of time because we have got to do the mathematics as we go along.62. Mr Samadi for the offence of assaulting Benjamin Ling with the intent to rob him of certain property whilst you were in company with five unknown male offenders, for that offence you are convicted. For that offence you are sentenced, but for your plea of guilty I would have sentenced you to two years imprisonment overall. Because of your plea of guilty and your contrition that is reduced to a sentence of eighteen months. I set a non-parole period of twelve months, to date from 5 April 2008 and to expire on 4 April 2009. The additional term will expire on 4 October 2009. 63. For the offence that you on 3 November 2006 at Carlingford did rob Zachary Deguyere of property, namely his Samsung mobile phone and $25 whilst you were in company with an unknown male you are convicted. I take into account the two offences that you committed on 28 March last which are on the Form 1. But for your plea of guilty I would have sentenced you to an overall sentence of four years. Discounting that it becomes an overall sentence of three years. I set a non-parole period of 15 months to date from 5 October 2008 and to expire on 4 January 2010. The balance of twenty-one months will expire on 4 October 2011. 64. In respect of the offences 3, 4 and 5, that is that on 7 November 2006 at Carlingford in the State of New South Wales you did rob firstly, Lindsay Clough, secondly Timothy Clough, thirdly Regan McDougall of property whilst you were in the company of unknown males but for your plea of guilty I would have set an overall sentence of three years and six months for each of those offences. Applying a twenty five per cent discount that becomes an overall sentence of two years seven months and 15 days. All of these sentences will be served concurrently and they are to date from 5 April 2009. Did I say that in respect of them I am setting a non-parole period of fifteen months? The non-parole period will expire on 4th July 2010.65. So the three offences I am now dealing with there is a minimum term of fifteen months, to date from 5 April 2009. So that will be 4 July 2010 and an additional term of seventeen (sic-should read sixteen) and a half months. 66. For offences six and seven those two are together also. That is that on 7 November you attempted to rob Daniel Baras and Chris Cooper whilst you were in the company of an unknown male I would have sentenced you to an overall sentence of three years which I have discounted to two years three months and in respect of those I have also set a non-parole period of fifteen months. I have commenced those sentences on 5 July 2009 and they will expire on 4 October 2010. 67. The sentence itself will expire completely on 4 October 2011, if my maths is correct. Subject to the maths being correct what I had intended is that there would be an overall minimum term running from 5 April 2008 to 4 October 2010 which should be two and a half years.68. I order the release of the offender on each of the expiry of the non-parole dates. Three years ten months thirteen days is the overall sentence. The offender may be returned to custody.

      On 15 September 2008 Peter James Henry, Hugh William James Gravett and David Anthony Swansson were presented for trial on charges that between that between 1 June 2003 and 17 December 2003 Henry and Gravett conspired with each other, Anthony Edward King, Mohamad Raghid Alchikh, Robert Hands and divers other persons to import into Australia prohibited imports contrary to s 233B(1B) of the  
      Customs Act 
       1901 (Cth) and s 11.5 of the  
      Criminal Code  
      (Cth), and that between about 28 September 2003 and 17 December 2003 Gravett aided abetted counselled and procured Anthony Edward King and Mohamad Raghid Alchikh to attempt to import into Australia prohibited imports contrary to s 233B(1B) of the  
      Customs Act 
       1901 (Cth) and s 11.1(1) of the  
      Criminal Code  
      (Cth). All three accused pleaded not guilty.  
       
        
       
      Swansson thereupon applied for an order that he be tried separately and alone and Henry applied for an order that he be tried separately from Swansson. Gravett applied for an order that he be tried separately from Henry. 
       
       
      Sweeney DCJ ordered that each of the accused be tried separately from each other and alone. 
       
       
      The Director of Public Prosecutions appealed against the order pursuant to s 5F of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       1912 on grounds that (1) the judge erred in finding that the case against Swansson was substantially different to the case against Henry; (2) that it was not open to the judge to conclude that evidence proposed to be led from Alchikh on behalf of Swansson created a real risk of positive injustice to Henry; (3) that the judge erred in finding that facts which occurred after a previous order that Swansson be tried separately from Henry and Gravett had been taken into account by the judge who had made that order; (4) that the judge had erred in holding that evidence which Henry proposed to give in explanation of telephone intercepts to be relied upon by the Crown created a real risk of substantial prejudice to Gravett; and (5) that the judge erred by making an order for separate trials of Swansson and Gravett when there was no identifiable basis for the making of that order.  
       
       
      Per Nettle AJA (McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing):  
       
       
      (1) Sweeney DCJ did not err in holding that the case against Swansson was substantially different to the cases against Henry and Gravett: [15] – [17]. 
       
       
      R v Dinh

      R v Dinh 
       [2000] NSWCCA 536 referred to.  
       
       
      (2) It was not shown that Sweeney DCJ was in error in holding that the evidence proposed to be led from Alchikh on behalf of Swansson created a real risk of positive injustice to Henry: [24] – [27].

      R v Matovski  
      (1989) 15 NSWLR 720 referred to. 
       
       
      (3) Sweeney DCJ did not find that facts which occurred after the previous order for a separate trial of Swansson had been taken into account by the judge who made that order: [30]. 
       
       
      (4) Sweeney DCJ had erred in holding that evidence which Henry proposed to give in explanation of telephone intercepts to be relied upon by the Crown created a real risk of substantial prejudice to Gravett: [35] - [36]. 
       
       
      (5) It did not appear that there was an adequate basis to order that Gravett be tried separately from Swansson, but it made no difference because it was not wrong to order that Swansson be tried separately from Henry and, since Swansson would need to be tried separately from Henry, the most appropriate order was for Gravett and Henry to be tried together and that Swansson be tried alone: [37] - [38]. 
       
       
      (8) The orders made below are set aside and it is ordered that David Anthony Swansson be tried separately and apart from Peter James Henry and David Anthony Swansson and that subject to further order Peter James Henry and Hugh William James Gravett be tried together: [42].

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Nettle AJA. 2 NETTLE AJA: This is an appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 against the interlocutory judgment and order of her Honour Judge Sweeney given and made on 15 September 2008 that each of the accused men, Henry, Gravett and Swansson, be tried separately from each other and alone. 3 Henry and Gravett are charged pursuant to s 233(1B) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and s 11.5 of the Criminal Code (Cth) that between 1 June 2003 and 17 December 2008 they conspired with Anthony Edward King, Mohamed Raghid Alchikh, Robert Hands and divers others to import into Australia prohibited imports, namely, not less than a commercial quantity of 3, 4 methylene dioxy–n –methyl amphetamine (MDMA) comprised of 165,000 tablets of MDMA, otherwise known as ecstasy. The importation is alleged to have occurred on 3 December 2003 when the P&O NedLloyd vessel Botany docked at West Swanson dock in Melbourne. The ship was carrying a container of 54 bar refrigerators with 23 kilograms of ecstasy hidden in the foam lining of the doors of six of those refrigerators. 4 Swansson is charged pursuant to s 233(1B) of the Customs Act 1901 (Cth) and s 11.1(1) of the Criminal Code (Cth) that between 28 September 2003 and 17 December 2003 he did aid abet counsel and procure the commission of an offence, namely, the attempted importation by King and Alchikh of the MDMA.5 All three accused and co-accused Alkarim, Warner, Hands and Gibson, were first presented for trial together, albeit on separate indictments, in February 2005. On 2 February 2005, his Honour Judge Woods ordered that Swansson and Alkarim be tried separately from Henry, Gravett, Warner, Hands and Gibson. Alchikh was separately presented and pleaded guilty to conspiring to import ecstasy. Thereafter he was sentenced on the basis of an undertaking to give evidence against his co-accused. 6 The trial of Henry, Gravett, Warner, Hands and Gibson began on 7 February 2005 and concluded on 26 May 2005. Warner was acquitted, and the jury could not reach a verdict in the case or Hands and Henry. Gravett was convicted of conspiring to import the MDMA. 7 Swansson and Alkarim were put up for trial and Hands for retrial in August 2005. The trial began on 1 August 2005 and concluded on 20 October 2005. Alkarim and Hands were convicted of conspiring to import the MDMA and Swansson was convicted of aiding and abetting the attempted importation of the MDMA.8 After successful appeals to this Court, the convictions were quashed on the ground that the several accused should have been presented on a single indictment; and, in the case of Henry and Gravett, it was ordered that new trials be had (Swansson v R; Henry v R [2007] NSWCCA 67; (2007) 168 A Crim R 263). Swansson advanced additional grounds of appeal but ultimately failed in an application for a direction for the entry of a judgment and verdict of acquittal (Swansson v R (Cth) [2008] NSWCCA 56). 9 Before Swansson’s additional grounds of appeal were finally heard and determined, Henry and Gravett were put up for retrial in January 2008, and retried between 29 January 2008 and 18 March 2008 (At that stage Swansson was still seeking a direction for entry of a judgment and verdict of acquittal.). On that occasion, however, the jury failed to reach a verdict. 10 Following the rejection of Swansson’s additional grounds of appeal, in September 2008 Henry, Gravett and Swansson were put up for retrial together. At the outset, counsel for Henry sought an order that Henry be tried separately from Swansson. The principal basis of his application was that counsel for Swansson proposes to call Alchikh to give evidence which it is believed will exonerate Swansson but which it is feared may be prejudicial to Henry. On the same day, counsel for Gravett moved ore tenus for an order that Gravett be tried separately from Henry. Counsel for Swansson made submissions in support of both applications. 11 After receiving written submissions and hearing oral argument, the judge allowed the applications. Her Honour held that each of the accused had established by reference to the Middis criteria (See R v Middis (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 27 March 1991, unreported)) that they should have separate trials and that the interests of justice required that each of the accused be tried separately from each other and alone. Relevant principles12 The principles which govern an application for separate trials are tolerably clear:  
     
      
      1) First, there are strong reasons of policy and principle why persons charged with committing an offence jointly or charged as participants in different degrees in relation to the same offence should be tried together ( 
      Webb v The Queen  
      [1994] HCA 30; 
        
      (1994) 181 CLR 41, 88-9). The concerns which support a joint trial in such circumstances include the trauma and inconvenience to witnesses which are involved in subjecting them to more than one trial; the increased time and expense involved in separate trials; and the highly desirable objective of avoiding inconsistent verdicts as between trials ( 
      R v Jones and Waghorn 
       (1991) 55 A Crim R 159, 185).  
      
     
     
      
      2) Secondly, the accused bears the burden of establishing that there is a need for separate trials. Separate trials should not be ordered unless it is demonstrated that there is a real risk of positive injustice as a consequence of a joint trial ( 
      R v Bikic 
       [2000] NSWSC 223; (2000) 112 A Crim R 163, 167 [22]-[23]).  
      
     
     
      
      3) Thirdly, while most joint trials may be productive of some degree of prejudice, prejudice of that sort will not be taken to amount to positive injustice unless it is of a kind which is not really amenable to nullification by judicial directions to the jury ( 
      R v Ditroia and Tucci 
       [1981] VR 247,  
      R v Jones and Waghorn 
       (1991) 55 A Crim R 159, 185).  
      
     
     
      
      4) Fourthly, one situation in which there may be grounds for separate trials is where the evidence admissible against one accused is significantly different from the evidence admissible against the other ( 
      R v Darby 
       [1982] HCA 32; (1982) 148 CLR 668, 678). Another, is where there is a likelihood that some evidence which is led against one accused will be prejudicial to the other, albeit inadmissible against him or her. A separate trial may be also required in some cases where the evidence against one accused may in effect swamp the jury’s consideration of the case against the other accused. The same may be true where the circumstances are such as to create a serious risk of an irrational finding of guilt by association ( 
      R v Chami 
       [2002] NSWCCA 136; (2002) 128 A Crim R 428, 431).  
      
     
     
      
      5) In  
      R v Middis  
      (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Hunt J, 27 March 1991, unreported, 4); see also  
      R v Baartma 
      n (Court of Criminal Appeal, 6 October 1994 unreported);  
      R v Piller 
       (1995) 86 A Crim R 249;  
      R v Georgiou 
       [1999] NSWCCA 125, [5]), Hunt CJ at CL identified three categories of case in which an order for separate trials may be warranted as follows: 
       
        
        a) Where the evidence against an applicant is significantly weaker than and different to the evidence admissible against other accused. 
         
        b) Where the evidence against a co-accused contains material which is highly prejudicial to the applicant although not admissible against him or her.  
         
        c) Where there is a real risk that the weaker Crown case against the applicant will be made immeasurably (in the sense of significantly albeit incomeasurably) stronger by reason of the prejudicial material.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
      6) It is recognised, however, that such guidelines as have been proffered cannot be exhaustive and that each case will depend upon its own facts. Each case involves a discretionary balancing exercise in which the concerns which support a joint trial must be weighed against the prejudices to the applicant ( 
      R v Alexander 
       [2002] VSCA 183; (2002) 6 VR 53, 67 [31]).  
      
    13 Different considerations may apply depending upon whether the trial judge is considering an application for severance at the outset of the trial or whether an appellate court is considering whether injustice has accrued to one of the accused from a joint trial (Ibid). Ground 1(a)14 As first formulated, Ground 1(a) of the appeal was that the judge erred in finding that the case against Swansson was substantially different from the case against his co-accused. But as so put, the ground was untenable. As the Crown now concedes, her Honour made no such finding and her reasoning was not dependent on the idea of there being a substantial difference between the case against Swansson and the case against his co-accused. Counsel for the Crown sought therefore to argue in the alternative that the judge had erred in accepting that there was ‘some merit’ in a submission put on behalf of Swansson that the Crown case against him was ‘substantially different in character’ from the case against his co-accused. In counsel’s submission, there was no merit in that argument because the evidence to be led against each accused would be substantially the same, namely, surveillance evidence and telephone intercepts of each of them engaging in various activities associated with the importation. 15 As far as I can see, her Honour did not make any error of that kind either. Relevantly, her Honour observed: 
     
      
       
        
        Mr Swansson’s application was made on the basis that he is charged with a different offence of different scope to that of the other two accused; that he is not charged with conspiring with the people with whom Mr Henry and Mr Gravett are charged with conspiring; that he is not charged with a conspiracy at all and that the time period of his charge is more limited; he is charged only with aiding and abetting the attempted importation by Mr King and Mr Alchikh… So that it was submitted on behalf of Mr Swansson there is a substantial difference in the cases which will be presented against Mr Swansson and against the other accused and that evidence of the actions of Mr King and Mr Henry, for example will not be admissible against Mr Swansson. 
        
       
      
    16 Thereafter, although her Honour expressly declined to decide the issue of whether evidence of the actions of King and Henry would be admissible against Swansson, she noted that, in order to prove the offence with which Swansson is charged, the Crown would probably have to present much the same if not all of the evidence that it proposes to lead against Henry and Gravett. Her Honour’s observation as to there being ‘some merit’ in the arguments put on behalf of Mr Swansson’ is thus to be read as subject to that recognition. I take it to mean that, even though the evidence to be led against each of them may be the same, the case to be presented against each of them will be substantially different. 17 With respect, I agree with her Honour. Like her Honour, I consider that there is a substantial difference between the case which will be presented against Mr Swansson and the cases which will be presented against the other accused. For whether or not the evidence to be presented in each case turns out to be the same, there is on any analysis a substantial difference between the case to be presented against an aider and abetter of an offence of attempted importation and a case of conspiracy to effect the importation (R v Dinh, R v Dinh (Supreme Court of New South Wales, Wood CJ at CL, 15 September 1999, unreported), [68]-[70]; R v Dinh [2000] NSWCCA 536 [27]). Ground 1(b)18 I turn to Ground 1(b). After Alchikh was arrested on 17 December 2008 he made a record of interview in which he stated that Swansson was not aware that the drugs were in the refrigerators. He repeated those facts in a detailed police statement dated 13 August 2004 and also in affidavits relied upon by the Crown in support of proceedings to extradite King and Salhari in April and August 2004. Alchikh also gave evidence to that effect at a bail hearing in July 2004, and for the Crown at the committal proceedings of Henry Gibson, Swansson and Alkarim in November 2004, and again to the same effect at his own sentencing hearing in August 2005, and at the trial of Swansson, Alkarin and Hands in 2005 (where he was called by the Crown and made available for cross-examination). 19 Consistently with views expressed by the Magistrate at the committal hearing and Judge Woods at the first trial, the Crown now takes the view that Alchikh is not a reliable witness and does not propose to call him at the retrials of Henry Gravett and Swansson, or to make him available for cross-examination. Counsel for Swansson, however, proposes to call Alchikh to give evidence to exonerate Swansson and, in order to establish that Alchickh was at one stage regarded by the Crown as a reliable witness, he intends to elicit from Alchikh that he made statements to the police on which the Crown relied. 20 Counsel for Henry argued below that he was concerned that, in that event, Alchikh might say something adverse to Henry which would necessitate an application for discharge of the jury and that the risk of discharge should be avoided by granting Henry a separate trial. In order to meet those concerns, the Crown proffered an undertaking that it would not cross-examine Alchikh about the things which he had said in previous evidence concerning Henry and would object if there were any attempt by Alchikh to give evidence about those things. The judge took the view that, despite the proffered undertaking, the prospect of Alchikh saying something prejudicial to Henry was sufficient to warrant an order that Henry be tried separately from Swansson. As her Honour put it: 
     
      
       
        
        There was an affidavit before me from Ms Armstrong of the DPP attaching statements and transcript of evidence previously give by Mr Alchikh, in which he had said that he had told the police he could implicate Mr Henry, whom he knew as Frank Moore, which on the Crown case is a false name used by Mr Henry to enter Australia on a false travel document, that Mr Henry gave him money in large quantities of cash, which were to be transferred to Mr King in England. Clearly those things would be prejudicial if they were given in evidence by Mr Alchikh in a trial involving Mr Henry.  
         
         
        … It seems that what Mr Henry, through his counsel, fears is that Mr Alchikh may be something of a loose cannon and that he may say something which may give rise to a need for an application to discharge the jury. While I accept the Crown’s undertaking that it will not seek to cross-examine Mr Alchikh about Mr Henry and that it would object if Mr Alchikh gave any evidence against Mr Henry, that in my view does not deal with the risk of Mr Alchikh being a loose cannon. With respect to all counsel involved they cannot necessarily control Mr Alchikh or what he will say and I think there is a very real risk, as opposed to a remote risk, given what Mr Alchikh has said in the past about Mr Henry, that if Mr Henry were tried with Mr Swansson that Mr Alchikh could give evidence highly prejudicial to Mr Henry, which would be avoided if Mr Henry and Mr Swansson were not tried together. I think that is a stronger ground for Mr Henry and Mr Swansson having their trials separated than the argument put on behalf of Mr Swansson that the Crown case against the persons in the conspiracy charge is stronger against him than the Crown case against Mr Swansson alone.  
        
       
      
    21 Under cover of Ground 1(b) the Crown contends that it was not open to the judge on the evidence to come to that conclusion. Indeed, as the Crown would have it, there is not even a remote possibility that Henry’s case would be prejudiced. Contrary to the judge’s reasoning, it was submitted, the assertion that Alchikh told police that he could ‘implicate’ Henry is not something which could be given in evidence - it was simply an assertion; the fact that Henry used the false name of ‘Frank Moore’ is something which the Crown proposes to prove aliunde, by means of Henry’s admission that he used that false name; and the fact that Henry gave Alchikh money in large quantities of cash will be proved by evidence of telephone intercepts between King and Henry. 22 At first sight there appeared to me to be something in that contention. Given what the Crown now says about its ability and intention to prove Henry’s use of the false name ‘Frank Moore’ and the receipt of large amounts of cash, one might doubt that anything which Alchikh could say about Henry’s involvement would be any more prejudicial to Henry than would otherwise be in evidence. Additionally, as was noted in the course of the Crown’s oral argument, the evidence which Alchikh gave on the last occasion about the receipt of money was, from the Crown’s perspective, tentative at best: at one point in his evidence he deposed, contrary to the Crown case, that the money was not for drugs but for another business (See T950.25 –T951.13 (AB 106-107) and T 953,15 (AB 109)). 23 It is true, as the judge observed, that Alchikh told police in his statement of 13 August 2004 and in his sworn affidavits in the extradition proceedings relating to King and Salhani, that King was the principal of the syndicate, Henry was his Australian second-in-command and Gravett and Salhani, Hands, Warner, Saxby and Cerisola were all party to the conspiracy. It is conceivable that, if details of that kind were to surface in the course of the trial, they could add ‘immeasurably’ to the case against Henry. It is also true, as the judge in effect said, that the possibility of a witness misbehaving cannot be excluded. But it was not suggested that there is anything in the way in which Alchikh gave evidence in the previous trial or on other occasions that should excite concerns about the way in which he is likely to behave in the coming trial. Thus I was at first inclined to the view that anything which Alchikh might say about Henry’s involvement could be excluded as irrelevant in the case against Swansson and that it would be possible to confine Alchikh accordingly to the evidence which it is proposed he give in exoneration of Swansson. 24 On further reflection, however, I do not think that one can at this stage exclude the possibility that something of what Alchikh told the police about the conspiracy and of Henry’s involvement in it may be admissible in Swansson’s defence - in order perhaps to demonstrate the depth and completeness of the admissions which Alchikh made to police and thus to imply that what he says about Swansson is equally deep and complete (See and compare R v Su [2003] VSC 306; (2003) 142 A Crim R 379). Another possibility, which was advanced by counsel for Swansson in the course of oral argument, is that he will seek to lead those details from Alchikh in order to demonstrate that there was a detailed criminal enterprise in myriad aspects of which Swansson plainly never took part. If so, it would not be sufficient to exclude the evidence that it might be prejudicial to Henry. Subject to the s 135 discretion, a trial judge cannot exclude evidence favourable to one accused on the ground that it might be prejudicial to another (R v Gibb and McKenzie [1983] 2 VR 155, 171; Lui Mie-Lin v The Queen [1989] 1 AC 288; cf. R v Darrington and McGauley [1980] VR 353, 384–385), and when it comes to contrasting probative value against prejudice for the purposes of s 135, it is of course prejudice to the accused, not a co-accused, which must be borne in mind. 25 It is also well to remember that a trial judge is usually in a better position to assess the likely course of evidence than an appellate court and as part of that to assess his or her own capacity to control proceedings when dealing with objectionable evidence and problematic witnesses. Within reasonable bounds, it is not for this court to substitute its own perception of how a trial should be conducted for a trial judge’s assessment of the way in which the course of evidence is likely to turn out. Especially is that so in a case like this in which there have already been several problematic trials. In my view, the judge was not wrong to approach the matter as one which warranted an additional degree of circumspection.26 Finally, on this point, and perhaps most importantly, it is necessary to bear steadily in mind that an appeal under s 5F is not a rehearing. As this Court has held repeatedly, a trial judge’s findings of fact and exercise of discretion may only be attacked where error is involved (R v BWM (1997) 91 A Crim R 260, 265-266; R v Matovski (1989) 15 NSWLR 720, 723). Where, as here, one is concerned with the exercise of discretion, it is plainly not enough to warrant appellate interference that the judges of the appellant court may consider that they would have taken a different course to the primary judge. It must first be demonstrated that the primary judge has acted upon a wrong principle, or taken into account extraneous matters, or made a mistake of fact or failed to take into account some material consideration (House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499, 504-5). 27 In the result, and despite my initial misgivings as to the risk of any prejudice to Henry, I am not satisfied that error of the kind identified in Ground 1(b) has been established. Accordingly, I reject that ground. Ground 2 28 I turn to Ground 2. When narrating the history of the matter at the outset of her ruling, the judge said this:  
     
      
       
        
        These accused were previously before Woods DCJ of this court in a trial in 2005 and the first issue which arises in respect of Mr Swansson’s application is whether the decision made by Woods DCJ in that trial to sever the trial of Mr Swansson and another person, Mr Alkarim who is not on this indictment, needs to be revisited or whether that decision stands. The submission was made by Mr Hogan, counsel for Mr Swansson, that that order should stand, that there has not been any change of circumstances which would cause that order of Woods DCJ to be revisited. The Crown made a submission that many circumstances have changed, including that since then Mr Alkchikh has given evidence, has been sentenced, that it is known what Mr Alchikh will say, all of which were matters which his Honour Woods DCJ took into account in his judgment. But the Crown says fundamentally the most important thing which has changed is that the Court of Criminal Appeal held that the trial in which Woods DCJ made that decision or ruling was a nullity or not held according to law because the Crow had presented a number of indictments against a number of accuse in the one trial.  
        
       
      
    29 The Crown’s argument in support of Ground 2 is that the judge thereby erred in holding that Judge Woods had taken into account that Alchikh had been sentenced for his part in the offence, and after being sentenced had given evidence favourable to Swansson, and therefore that there was some certainty as to the evidence he might give in the forthcoming trial. Counsel for the Crown submitted that it is plain that Judge Woods could not have taken those matters into account because none of them occurred until after his Honour made the order for separate trials, and that the judge’s misunderstanding of that fact in this case had inflated her Honour’s perception of the possible prejudice to Henry of the evidence which Alchikh might give against him if called to give evidence on behalf of Swansson. 30 I reject that argument. In my view the judge made no error of the kind alleged. Read in the context of the whole of the passage of the ruling to which I have referred, it is obvious that what her Honour meant by the words ‘all of which were matters which his Honour Woods DCJ took into account in his judgment’ is that what Judge Woods took into account at the time of his ruling was that Alchikh had not been sentenced or given evidence and therefore that there was no certainty to what he would say. 31 In case it matters, I add that I doubt that the point would be of any significance in any event. As it appears to me, the judge decided herself that the possibility of prejudice to Henry was such as to warrant an order for separate trials. Thus, whatever her Honour may have thought about the reasoning of Judge Woods was really by the by. It is true that her Honour said that she regarded Judge Wood’s ruling as persuasive. But there was no error involved in taking that view of it. Even if that there had been some changes since the ruling was published, Judge Wood’s decision was still something to which her Honour could properly have regard in coming to the conclusion that she did. Indeed it would have been surprising if her Honour had not taken it into account. Ground 3 32 I turn to Ground 3. As already noted, Henry and Gravett are charged with conspiring with each other and with others to import prohibited drugs. Gravett’s application for a trial separate from Henry was based on an affidavit sworn by his solicitor, Mr Cummins, concerning the fact that a substantial amount of the evidence which the Crown proposes to adduce at the trial consists of intercepts of telephone conversations, many of which involved Henry and King but not Gravett. The affidavit recorded that, at the previous trial, Henry had given evidence in which he sought to explain the conversations with King as relating to a criminal enterprise for the importation of counterfeit sunglasses and handbags, in which he implicated Gravett by reason of being involved in one of those conversations. Gravett elected not to give evidence and it is said that he proposes to adopt the same course at the coming trial. 33 The judge held that the combination of the prejudicial effect of that evidence coupled with the effect upon the jury of seeing Henry give evidence and Gravett electing not to do so, was sufficient to warrant that he be tried separately from Henry. As her Honour put it:  
     
      
       
        
        it would ordinarily not be permitted that evidence of an accused person’s involvement in other alleged criminal activities, which he does not choose to give evidence about, would be admitted in evidence against him at his trial. In the situation where Mr Gravett chooses to not give evidence that he was involved in the importation of allegedly counterfeit items rather than the importation of drugs, then it seems to me to be prejudicial for him that a co-accused gives evidence that he was involved in that other criminal activity and highlights the fact that he has not given evidence. Even if Mr Henry’s counsel were not to make any comment, then an observant jury would likely notice the difference between one co-accused giving evidence and one not. Now, I accept that that commonly happens when two accused persons are tried together. But I think given the combination of the one accused electing to give evidence and the other choosing to exercise his right to silence and the prejudicial evidence of other criminality being given by a co-accused, that that is evidence which is prejudicial to Mr Gravett and not admissible against him in terms of the evidence of other alleged criminality. For that reason it is my view that Mr Gravett should be tried separately from Mr Henry.  
        
       
      
    34 The gist of the Crown’s argument under Ground 3 is that what was there said was in error because it was not open to the judge to conclude that evidence of telephone call intercepts between Henry and King in which the accused was not involved was inadmissible against Gravett. In the alternative it was submitted that the judge had erred in failing to consider the Crown’s submission that evidence of telephone call intercepts admissible against Gravett implicated him in other illegal activity and that at the previous trial Gravett had not sought to cross-examine Henry about those matters. In the further alternative, it was said that, if the evidence were not admissible against Gravett, any prejudice could be dealt with adequately by directions to the jury. 35 In my view, there is force in those submissions. In the way in which the Crown now intends to put its case against Henry and Gravett, the evidence of telephone calls between Henry and King to which Gravett was not party will be admissible against Gravett. In the end, so much was properly conceded by counsel for Gravett in the course of oral argument. Contrary, therefore, to the way in which the judge approached the matter, it is clear that there will be evidence before the jury which will to some extent tend to implicate Gravett in the activities the subject of those conversations. It is true that the evidence which Henry is likely to give will be that the conversations were to do with an illegal enterprise for the importation of counterfeit sunglasses and handbags, rather than drugs. It is also true that, if that evidence is given, it will have the capacity to implicate Gravett in an illegal enterprise for the importation of counterfeit sunglasses and handbags. In that sense, it has the capacity to disclose that Henry was involved in criminal activity other than that with which he is charged. But with respect to the judge, it seems to me that the possibility that Gravett was engaged in such an enterprise as opposed to one for the importation of drugs could only be of assistance to Gravett’s defence or, at worst, that the gravity of such criminal activity when compared to the offence with which he is charged is so relatively innocuous that any resulting prejudice to Gravett could readily be dealt with by appropriate directions. 36 I take a similar view about such if any prejudice as may be involved in the jury noting the difference between Henry‘s decision to give evidence and Gravett’s decision to remain in the dock. It is the sort of thing which is commonplace in criminal trials for conspiracy or otherwise in which there are multiple accused and, as is usually the case, I should think that it could to be dealt with adequately by appropriate directions. 37 In so saying, I am of course conscious of the need to avoid transgressing upon a trial judge’s exercise of discretion simply on the basis that I take a different view as to the manner in which it should be exercised. But it seems to me that the difference here is that the judge apparently failed to take into account the evidence of telephone calls between King and Henry to which Gravett was not party but which is unarguably admissible against Gravett, and thus to some extent may implicate him whatever criminal or other activity was the subject of those discussions. In my view, that amounts to an error which vitiates the exercise of discretion and creates a need for it to be exercised afresh. On that basis, I would uphold Ground 3. Ground 438 Under Ground 4, the Crown complains that there was no basis for an order for separate trials of Swansson and Gravett. In counsel’s submission, there was no evidence in support of the order. Nor is there anything in the judge’s ruling to explain why her Honour considered it to be necessary to make the order, apart from the conclusory observation that each of the applicants had brought themselves within the Middis criteria. 39 Once again, it appears to me that there is some force in the Crown’s submission. So far as I can see, there is nothing in the judge’s ruling to explain her Honour’s reasons for ordering that Gravett be tried separately from Swansson, and counsel for the respondents did not suggest that there was anything which otherwise supports the making of such an order. 40 In the end, however, I doubt that it makes any difference. Since (for the reasons already given) I am not persuaded that the judge erred in ordering that Swansson be tried separately from Henry, I take the view that it will be necessary for there be at least two trials. And since, in that event, Swansson would need to be tried separately from Henry, it strikes me that the most appropriate orders to make would be that Gravett and Henry to be tried together and that Swansson be tried alone. Conclusion and orders41 It follows that I would allow the appeal in part. I would set aside the order below. In lieu thereof I would order that Mr Swansson be tried separately and apart from Mr Henry and Mr Gravett but that, subject to further order, that Mr Henry and Mr Gravett be tried together.

     NSW CRIME COMMISSION v VOLKARD KELAITA 
      
      
     Headnote 
    The New South Wales Crime Commission applied for, and was granted, an order under s 10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the “Act”) restraining certain property of the respondent. The Commission later sought an order for the forfeiture of the restrained property and other property under s 22 of the Act. A judge of the Supreme Court made two orders: an assets forfeiture order in respect to the property; and an order that there be judgment for the Commission on its claim for a proceeds assessment order under s 27 of the Act, the amount to be assessed. The primary judge, McCallum J, assessed the amount recoverable.The question before the primary judge and on appeal was whether the assessment of an amount of money ordered to be paid by the respondent to the Treasurer by a proceeds assessment order pursuant to s 27 of the Act should, or may, take into account, by way of reduction, the value of property the subject of a forfeiture order under s 22 of the Act. McCallum J answered the question in the affirmative. The Commission appealed. 
     
      
      Held, allowing the appeal: 
       
       
      (Allsop P; Giles JA and Bell JA agreeing) 
       
       
      1. The statute does not provide for a proceeds assessment order under s 27 to be reduced by the value of property the subject of a forfeiture order under s 22. A proceeds assessment order under s 27 can be made even though an assets forfeiture order under s 22 can also be made: [28]. 
       
       
      2. The issue of double counting is a matter the express attention of Parliament. All states, other than New South Wales, have made some provision in relation to the issue. It is open to the Parliament of New South Wales to legislate in relation to the issue. It is not a matter legitimately within the province of interpretation and construction of the statute. To the extent that the operation of the Act is unfair, it is a matter for Parliament to remedy: [57], [58], [59]. 
      
     
     
      
      3. The forfeiture of property in circumstances provided by the Act can be seen to be a drastic interference with fundamental rights of property, although the affectation of property rights in any given context may not necessarily be an interference with “fundamental” rights: [13], [14], [15]. 
      
     
     
      
      4. Penal provisions and a provision of the kind here are and is to be construed strictly. The correct approach to their construction and interpretation is to use the ordinary rules of statutory construction and interpretation, and to recognise that if, after those rules are applied, the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful such ambiguity or doubt should be resolved in favour of the subject: [16], [17].

     NSW CRIME COMMISSION v VOLKARD KELAITA 
      
      
     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: The question in this appeal is short, but of considerable importance: whether the assessment of an amount of money ordered to be paid by the respondent to the Treasurer by a proceeds assessment order pursuant to the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the “Act”), s 27 should, or may, take into account, by way of reduction, the value of property the subject of a forfeiture order under the Act, s 22, at least in circumstances where the two orders are made substantially contemporaneously. 
     
      
    2 The primary judge (McCallum J) answered the question in the affirmative. In my view, for the reasons that follow, that conclusion was, with respect, not correct. 
     
      
       
      Background 
       
      
    3 On 11 August 2005, a Judge of the Court made a restraining order under the Act, s 10 in relation to funds in a bank account with St George Bank Limited in the respondent’s name, a nominated motor vehicle, and a nominated motorcycle. 
     
      
    4 The following year, the appellant moved the Court by notice of motion for an order under the Act, s 22 for the forfeiture of the property originally restrained and other property listed in the schedule to the notice of motion, being cash and gambling chips (together having a face value of $7,310) and shares in three public companies. On 21 September 2006, a Judge of the Court (Latham J) granted leave to amend the summons to include the claim for forfeiture made in the notice of motion. Latham J, having heard the matter made two relevant orders: first, an assets forfeiture order in respect of the property listed in the schedule to the notice of motion; and, secondly, an order that there by judgment for the appellant on its claim for a proceeds assessment order in an amount to be assessed. 
     
      
    5 It was that assessment that came before the primary judge over two days in February 2008. 
     
      
       
      The Act and the approach to its interpretation 
       
      
    6 The purposes of the Act can be derived from at least three sources: the long title of the Act, the statement of principal objects in s 3 and the Second Reading Speech. 
     
      
    7 The long title is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        An Act to provide for the confiscation of interests in property that are interests of a person engaged in serious crime related activities; to enable proceeds of serious crime related activities to be recovered as a debt due to the Crown; and for other purposes. 
        
       
      
    8 Section 3 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        The principal objects of this Act are: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) to provide for the confiscation, without requiring a conviction, of property of a person if the Supreme Court finds it to be more probably than not that the person has engaged in serious crime related activities, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) to enable the proceeds of serious crime related activities to be recovered as a debt due to the Crown, and 
        
       
       
        
        (b1) to provide for the confiscation, without requiring a conviction, of property of a person that is illegally acquired property held in a false name or is not declared in confiscation proceedings, and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) to enable law enforcement authorities effectively to identify and recover property. 
        
       
      
    9 On 8 May 1990, the then Premier, Treasurer and Minister for Ethnic Affairs (the Hon Nick Greiner) said the following in relation to the Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Bill: 
     
      
       
        
        This legislation is aimed squarely at those associated with major drug crime. Its purpose is to deprive those involved in the drug trade of their illicit profits – profits earned at the expense of their victims and of the community generally. Importantly, it is not only the profits of a discrete transaction but the proceeds of a life of crime that will be confiscated. Also crucial is the fact that it is not only the person directly involved in the transaction but also those who knowingly benefit from his or her activities who will be called to account for drug-derived assets and profits. Therefore, the legislation represents a comprehensive scheme designed to undermine entire organisations engaged in the drug trade. 
        
       
       
        
         The scheme of the legislation is essentially very simple. It says that if the State Drug Crime Commission can satisfy a Supreme Court judge that it is more probable than not that a person has engaged in activities that constitute serious drug crimes, that person will have to prove to the judge that he or she obtained his or her property and assets lawfully, otherwise they will be forfeited to the Crown. As well, the Supreme Court judge can assess the profits made through serious drug crimes, and order the person to pay these profits to the Crown. The legislation provides that the money and assets recovered can be used to compensate victims of crime, to enhance law enforcement in New South Wales and for drug rehabilitation and education purposes. A serious of royal commissioners – Stewart, Williams, Costigan and Moffitt – have urged governments in Australia to pursue the profits of organised crime. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         There is no doubt the proposed legislation is tough. But unless governments are willing to take a tough line on drug profits the situation described by Mr Justice Moffitt will continue to get worse. … The most innovative and controversial aspect of this legislation is that it will create a scheme of asset confiscation that will operate outside and completely independent of the criminal law process. … This legislation, like the Commonwealth Customs Act, treats the question of confiscation as a separate issue from the imposition of a criminal penalty. It essentially provides that a person can be made to account for and explain assets and profits whether or not the person has been convicted, and even if the person has been acquitted in the criminal courts. The critical thing that must be proved is that it is more probably than not that the person engaged in serious drug crime. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         I want to emphasise, however, that no criminal consequences will flow from this legislation. Rather, the consequences are that the person has to justify, account for, and explain where his or her assets come from. Only if the person cannot show the assets were derived lawfully will they be retained by the Crown. The Supreme Court can also assess the amount of profit made from a drug activity. This amount becomes a debt recoverable by the Crown out of the person’s assets. But once again the focus is on accounting for profits. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         No doubt some people will contend that this legislation is unfair – that it amounts to convicting people of offences on a lower standard of proof and without the protection of the criminal law. I have already said that this legislation is all about the accounting of profits in civil proceedings, not imposition of criminal sanctions in criminal courts. The object or focus of the proceedings is recovery of assets and profits, not putting people in gaol. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
         In the case of drug crime there is normally no identifiable victim with a recognised cause of action in the civil courts. In an important sense the whole community is the victim, and certainly those whose lives are destroyed by drugs are victims. What the proposed legislation will do is analogous to giving the Crown a civil right of action to recover, on behalf of the community, assets and profits obtained illicitly by people who benefit form the drug trade. I am sure that honourable members of this House and all law-abiding members of the community will agree that that is eminently fair. There is also a parallel here with taxation law. Recovery of tax is undertaken through civil proceedings on the balance of probabilities. This measure is analogous to the imposition of a tax of 100 per cent on the profits of those engaged in the drug trade and their associates. Looking at the legislation from this perspective shows its clear deterrent value, as a disincentive to the drug trade. It will deprive the drug trade of its underlying motive and its economic base. 
        
       
       
        
         There are also clear safeguards in the legislation that I wish to draw to the attention of honourable members. I have already indicated that the relevant proceedings will be brought in the Supreme Court and that a Supreme Court judge must first come to the conclusion that it is more probable than not that a person has been involved in drug-related activities. The power to institute proceedings under the proposed legislation is specifically confined to the State Drug Crime Commission. The commission is headed by Judge Thorley, and the former chief magistrate, Mr Briese, is a member. The commission has the forensic experience, expertise and judgment that will ensure the responsible administration of the legislation. It is critical to note that if the commission restrains a person’s assets and commences proceedings against that person, the commission will have to indemnify the person against damages incurred if it is unsuccessful. There are also provisions designed to prevent prejudice to concurrent or subsequent criminal proceedings. 
        
       
      
    10 The Second Reading Speech, whilst of little assistance in understanding the text of the Act in its current form, provides some guidance as to the public purpose behind it, expressed, perhaps more concisely and prosaically, in the long title and s 3. That is not a criticism of the rhetoric in the speech. It reflected an important public policy in attacking criminal undertaking in society, in particular the trafficking in drugs – an aspect of significance for the protection and well-being of any civil society. 
     
      
    11 What is not available from the speech, however, is any purpose of intended precision in the process, as seemed to be derived by the primary judge. For instance, the 100% tax analogy used by the Premier should not be seen as the basis for some legislative purpose requiring precision in the operation of the Act. The reference was an aspect of the (entirely legitimate) political rhetoric of the speech. 
     
      
    12 Further, the speech recognised that the legislation might be perceived to be unfair by some. It was certainly intended to be “tough”. Again, these were rhetorical statements which do not assist in resolving questions about the precise linguistic content of the present text. They do, however, assist in appreciating that unless the express safeguards provided for in the Act (often resting on a reversed onus) are engaged, it may be seen as surprising to interpret or construe the Act in a way based on “fairness” to the person proved to have been engaged in serious crime related activities. Indeed, as will be seen, the Act provides in terms for operation of the machinery of recovery in ways that, from one perspective, could be taken to display an element of unfairness. 
     
      
    13 Before turning to the provisions of the Act, something more should be said about the approach to interpretation and construction of the Act. I have already referred to what can be seen as the important public and social policy lying behind the Act in the protection of civil society. Set against that, of course, is the recognition in the common law of the need for clarity in any statute which provides for the confiscation of, or derogation from, property rights. In Studman v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2007] NSWCA 285; 177 A Crim R 34 at 40 [35] McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Spigelman CJ and Handley AJA agreed), said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        I accept as the appellant submitted that, being provisions of a statute which provides for the confiscation or derogation from property rights, the statute must be strictly construed. The intention to take away property must be expressed with “irresistible clearness” before it may be applied. ( 
        Jeffrey v DPP (Cth) 
         (1995) 79 A Crim R 514). Any statutory ambiguity should be interpreted so as to respect a person’s property rights ( 
        DPP v Saxon 
         (1992) 28 NSWLR 263 at 270;  
        Saffron v DPP (Cth) 
         (1989) 87 ALR 151 at 155;  
        Diez v DPP (Cth) 
         (2004) 62 NSWLR 1 at [42]). 
         
        
       
      
    14 No criticism was made of this formulation by Mr Temby before the primary judge or in this Court. It can be accepted as an expression of the principle of legality in the interpretation of statutes: see generally Spigelman CJ writing extra-judicially “The Principle of Legality and the Clear Statement of Principle” NSW Bar Association Conference Working With Statutes 18 March 2005. See also Harrison v Melhem [2008] NSWCA 67 at [2]-[5], [7]-[11], [220] and [235] and the cases there discussed as to fundamental rights. See also in this context Malika Holdings Pty Limited v Stretton [2001] HCA 14; 204 CLR 290 at 298-299 [28]-[30], Gifford v Strang Patrick Holdings Pty Limited [2003] HCA 33; 214 CLR 269 at 284 [36] and the discussion by Basten JA in Hadjigeorgiou v New South Wales Crime Commission [2007] NSWCA 197; 174 A Crim R 124 at 146 [95] and New South Wales v Bujdoso [2007] NSWCA 44; 69 NSWLR 302 at [56]. 
     
      
    15 The recognition in the common law of the need for clarity in the confiscation of property rights is rooted in the importance of such rights and their legitimate protection in civil society free from the exercise of arbitrary power, in particular in the use of the prerogative power, or in today’s political framework, Executive power. Such concerns are deeply embedded in the common law and are, and have been, reflected in national and international public instruments of government for centuries: French Declaration of Human and Civil Rights 26 August 1789, Articles 2 and 17; United States Constitution, 5th and 14th Amendments; the European Protocol to the Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, Paris 20 March 1952, Art 1; and the Australian Constitution, s 51(xxxi). Whilst the affectation of property rights in any given context may not necessarily be an interference with “fundamental” rights: see Malika, Gifford and Bujdoso above, the forfeiture of property in circumstances provided by the Act can be seen to be a drastic interference with fundamental rights of property. Of course, that property may have a relationship with criminal activity which engages the Act and its underlying public policy. Nevertheless the interference with property rights is drastic, and the rights at this point in the process can be seen to be fundamental. 
     
      
    16 The common law principle of interpretation discussed in Studman, does not, however, deny, in the process of construction and interpretation, any role for the recognition of the social or public policy lying behind the Act. The ascertainment of the requisite clarity and the resolution of any ambiguity takes place within the ordinary process of statutory construction and interpretation. Penal statutes, likewise, are construed strictly; but the correct approach to their construction and interpretation is to use the ordinary rules of statutory construction and interpretation, and to recognise that if, after those rules are applied, the language of the statute remains ambiguous or doubtful such ambiguity or doubt should be resolved in favour of the subject because there will not be the requisite clarity to justify the application of the penal statute: see, for example, in the field of interpretation of penal statutes Beckwith v The Queen [1976] HCA 55; 135 CLR 569 at 576; Deming No 456 Pty Ltd v Brisbane Unit Development Corporation Pty Ltd [1983] HCA 44; 155 CLR 129 at 145; and Waugh v Kippen [1986] HCA 12; 160 CLR 156 at 164-165. 
     
      
    17 The identification of a relevant cannon of construction such as that in Studman and related cases, or that in Beckwith and related cases, does not mean that the process of statutory construction and interpretation, as a whole, based on close attention to the text and structure of the relevant provisions by reference to the language of the statute viewed as a whole, set in its proper context and recognising the evident aim and purpose of the legislation should not be undertaken. In other words, the recognition of one cannon of construction such as recognised in Studman does not require reversion to a literal analysis of the provision with an eye to the discernment of textual ambiguity through finely spun distinctions. As Professor Pearce said in Statutory Interpretation in Australia, 5th Ed (2001) Butterworths, Sydney at 232, [9.8], speaking of such a literalist or solely textual approach: 
     
      
       
        
        This somewhat naïve approach leads to the situation where counsel and judges worry away at individual words of Acts, seeking to squeeze out a possible interpretation that will enable a defendant to be acquitted. The intention of the legislature becomes lost in a semantic tournament. This in turn results in the courts being denigrated for not looking to the purpose of an Act, for being too ‘legalistic’. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    18 Turning to the text of the Act, Part 2 deals with restraining orders and Part 3 deals with confiscation. In Part 1 a number of important definitions are provided in s 4(1), relevantly here: 
     
      
       
        
        proceeds 
        , in relation to an activity, includes any interest in property, and any service, advantage or benefit, that is derived or realised, directly or indirectly, as a result of the activity:

          (b) by another person at the direction or request (given or made directly or indirectly) of the person engaged in the activity. 
          
         
         
        external serious crime related activity 
         means serious crime related activity arising out of an offence under the law of the Commonwealth or a place outside this State (including outside Australia) which, if the offence had been committed in this State, would be a serious criminal offence. 
         
         
        fraudulently acquired property 
         means an interest in property that is fraudulently acquired property as provided by section 9A.

          (a) a serious crime related activity, or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) an act or omission that constitutes an offence (including a common law offence) against the laws of New South Wales or the Commonwealth, or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) an act or omission that occurs outside New South Wales, is an offence against the law of the place where it occurs and is of a kind that, if it had occurred in New South Wales, would have been an offence referred to in paragraph (b). 
          
         
         
        illegally acquired property 
         means an interest in property that is illegally acquired property as provided by section 9.

      —see section 6. 
      
    19 Sections 9 and 9A, are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        9 Meaning of “serious crime derived property” and “illegally acquired property” 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) An interest in property is serious crime derived property if:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) it is all or part of the proceeds of a serious crime related activity, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) it is all or part of the proceeds of the disposal of or other dealing in serious crime derived property, or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) it was wholly or partly acquired using serious crime derived property. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) The references in subsection (1) (b) and (c) to serious crime derived property are not limited to serious crime derived property described in subsection (1) (a) but also include interests in property that are serious crime derived property because of a previous operation or previous operations of subsection (1) (b) or (c) or their combined operation. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2A) Without limiting subsection (1), an interest in property is taken to be wholly or partly acquired using serious crime derived property if it is, or has been, subject to a mortgage, lien, charge, security or other encumbrance wholly or partly discharged using all or part of the proceeds of a serious crime related activity or serious crime derived property. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3) Once an interest in property becomes serious crime derived property it remains serious crime derived property even if the interest is disposed of or otherwise dealt with (including by being used to acquire an interest in property), but this is qualified by subsection (5). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (4) The meaning of  
        illegally acquired property 
         is ascertained by substituting, in subsections (1)–(3),  
        illegally acquired property for serious crime derived property 
         and  
        illegal activity 
         for  
        serious crime related activity 
        . 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (5) An interest in property ceases to be serious crime derived property or illegally acquired property:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) when it is acquired by a person for sufficient consideration without knowing, and in circumstances that would not arouse a reasonable suspicion, that the interest was, at the time of acquisition, serious crime derived property or illegally acquired property, or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) when it vests in a person as a result of the distribution of the estate of a deceased person, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) when the interest is sold or otherwise disposed of under the authority of this Act (including when discharging a proceeds assessment order), or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) when it is the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of serious crime derived property or illegally acquired property under the authority of this Act except a sale under section 10 (8) (b) or 14, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) when it is acquired by a person as payment of reasonable legal expenses incurred in connection with an application under this Act or incurred in defending a criminal charge, or 
          
         
         
        (f) in such other circumstances as may be prescribed. 
         
         
        (6) If an interest in property that is not serious crime derived property or illegally acquired property was once owned by a person and was then serious crime derived property or illegally acquired property, the property becomes serious crime derived property or illegally acquired property, respectively, if and when it is again acquired by the person. 
         
         
        (7) The proceeds of a sale or other dealing do not lose their identity as such merely as a result of being credited to an account. 
         
         
        (8) It does not matter whether the serious crime related activity, illegal activity, disposition or other dealing or acquisition by reason of which an interest in property becomes serious crime derived property or illegally acquired property took place before or after the commencement of this section. 
         
         
        (9) The following are examples of the practical operation of this section showing the ways in which an interest in property can become serious crime derived property and stop being serious crime derived property:  
         
         
          
          (a) if money that is the proceeds of a serious crime related activity is used to buy land, the land becomes serious crime derived property and the money used (which is now in the hands of some other person) continues to be serious crime derived property, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if the land is then sold it continues to be serious crime derived property and the money paid for it becomes serious crime derived property, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) if the money paid for the land is then used to buy a car, the car becomes serious crime derived property and the money used to buy it (now in the hands of the car’s former owner) continues to be serious crime derived property unless the purchase was for sufficient consideration from an innocent person. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        9A Meaning of “fraudulently acquired property” 
        
       
       
        
        (1) An interest in property is fraudulently acquired property if the interest is held in a false name and any of the following was knowingly used for the purposes of acquiring, or dealing with, that property:  
         
         
          
          (a) a false instrument (including a birth certificate or other identity document) or signature, 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a birth certificate or other identity document of another person. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) In this section:  
        
       
       
        
        false instrument 
         has the same meaning as it has in Division 2 (False instruments) of Part 5 of the  
        Crimes Act 1900. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        identity document 
         includes any document that may be used for the purposes of an identity verification procedure under the  
        Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 
         of the Commonwealth. 
        
       
      
    20 By the Act, s 10 the appellant may apply ex parte for a restraining order on the basis set out in that section. The order may, for example, be directed to any interests in property of a person suspected of having engaged in serious crime related activity (s 10(2)(a)). The Court must make the order if the application is accompanied by an affidavit stating the suspicion and the grounds of the suspicion and the Court considers that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion (s 10(3)). 
     
      
    21 The restraining order, if made, remains in force while there is an application for a forfeiture order or a proceeds assessment order on foot or while there is an unsatisfied proceeds assessment order. 
     
      
    22 By the Act, s 12 the Court may make orders for the examination on oath of persons concerning property and for the provision of information on oath about the existence of property. 
     
      
    23 Confiscation in Part 3 is dealt with in four Divisions: Division 1 dealing with assets forfeiture orders; Division 2 dealing with proceeds assessment orders; Division 2A dealing with further forfeiture and proceeds and proceeds assessment orders in relation to property not disclosed; and Division 3 dealing with the establishment of a Confiscated Proceeds Account. 
     
      
    24 Section 22 (in Part 3 Division 1) sets out the circumstances in which an assets forfeiture order will be made. Relevantly, s 22 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for an order forfeiting to, and vesting in, the Crown all or any of the interests in property that are, or are proposed to be, subject to a restraining order when the assets forfeiture order takes effect. 
         
        … 
         
         
        (2) The Supreme Court must make an assets forfeiture order if the Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person whose suspected serious crime related activity, or serious crime related activities, formed the basis of the restraining order was, at any time not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the assets forfeiture order, engaged in:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2A) The Supreme Court must make an assets forfeiture order if the Court finds it more probable than not that interests in property subject to an application are fraudulently acquired property that is also illegally acquired property. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3) A finding of the Court for the purposes of subsection (2) need not be based on a finding as to the commission of a particular offence or a finding as to any particular quantity involved, and can be based:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) on a finding that some offence or other constituting a serious crime related activity and punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more was committed, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) on a finding that some offence or other constituting a serious crime related activity was committed involving some quantity or other that was an indictable quantity. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3A) A finding of the Supreme Court for the purposes of subsection (2A) need not be based on a particular finding as to the commission of a particular offence and can be based on a finding that some offence or other constituting illegal activity was committed. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (4) When an assets forfeiture order is made it must be made so as to apply to specified interests in property. 
         
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (6) The raising of a doubt as to whether a person engaged in a serious crime related activity or whether a quantity is an indictable quantity is not of itself sufficient to avoid a finding by the Supreme Court under subsection (2). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (6A) The raising of a doubt as to whether a person engaged in an illegal activity is not of itself sufficient to avoid a finding by the Supreme Court under subsection (2A). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (7) The quashing or setting aside of a conviction for a serious crime related activity or illegal activity does not affect the validity of an assets forfeiture order that was made before or after the conviction was quashed or set aside and was based on the activity. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (8) The making of an assets forfeiture order does not prevent the making of a proceeds assessment order under Division 2 which assesses the value of the proceeds of, or is based on, the serious crime related activity or illegal activity on which the assets forfeiture order was based. 
        
       
       … 
      
    25 As can be seen from the above provisions, if the owner of the property is proved to have engaged in the relevant serious crime related activity in the relevant six year period, all his or her property may be subject to forfeiture. Three provisions, in particular, ameliorate the operation of s 22 in this regard. First, under s 24, the Court, if it is satisfied that a forfeiture order will operate to cause hardship to a dependant, may make orders to prevent that. Secondly, under s 25, the Court is able to make an order excluding property from the forfeiture order, but only in circumstances referred to in s 25(2), as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (2) The Supreme Court must not make the exclusion order applied for unless it is proved that it is more probable than not that:  
         
         
          
          (a) in the case of an order relating to fraudulently acquired property—the interest in property to which the application relates is not fraudulently acquired property or is not illegally acquired property, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) in any other case—the interest in property to which the application relates is not illegally acquired property. 
          
         
        
       
      
    26 The onus on the person in s 25(2) is a heavy one when one appreciates the width of the meaning of “illegally acquired property” (in s 9) and “proceeds” (in s 4(1)). 
     
      
    27 Thirdly, under s 26, the Court is able to make an order excluding specified proportions of property from the forfeiture. The circumstances in which such an order can be made are set out in s 26(1), (1A) and (2), as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) If it is proved that it is more probable than not that a specified proportion of the value of an interest in property that has been forfeited under an assets forfeiture order is not attributable to the proceeds of an illegal activity, the Supreme Court may:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) make a declaration to that effect, and 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) order that the person who has forfeited the interest is entitled to be paid the proportion of the proceeds of sale of the interest that is specified in the declaration. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (1A) If it is proved that it is more probable than not that a specified proportion of the value of an interest in property that has been forfeited under an assets forfeiture order on the ground that it was fraudulently acquired property was not fraudulently acquired property or is not attributable to the proceeds of an illegal activity, the Supreme Court may:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) make a declaration to that effect, and 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) order that the person who has forfeited the interest is entitled to be paid the proportion of the proceeds of sale of the interest that is specified in the declaration. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) A declaration that an interest in property is not attributable to the proceeds of an illegal activity is to be made on the basis of the extent to which the interest in property concerned was not, when it first became illegally acquired property, acquired using the proceeds of an illegal activity. 
        
       
      
    28 Sections 27 and 28 (in Part 3 Division 2) set out the circumstances in which proceeds assessment order will be made (s 27); and how the value of the proceeds is to be assessed (s 28). Relevantly, ss 27 and 28 are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        27 Making of proceeds assessment order 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (1) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for a proceeds assessment order requiring a person to pay to the Treasurer an amount assessed by the Court as the value of the proceeds derived by the person from an illegal activity, or illegal activities, of the person or another person that took place not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order, whether or not any such activity is an activity on which the application is based as required by subsection (2) or (2A). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) The Supreme Court must make a proceeds assessment order if the Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person against whom the order is sought was, at any time not more than 6 years before the making of the application for the order, engaged in:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) a serious crime related activity involving an indictable quantity, or 
           
           
          (b) a serious crime related activity involving an offence punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more. 
          
         
        
       
       … 
       
        
        (5) The quashing or setting aside of a conviction for a serious crime related activity does not affect the validity of a proceeds assessment order. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (6) The making of a proceeds assessment order does not prevent the making under Division 1 of an assets forfeiture order based on the serious crime related activity, or on all or any of the serious crime related activities, in relation to which the proceeds assessment order is made. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (7) The amount a person is required to pay under a proceeds assessment order is a debt payable by the person to the Crown on the making of the order and is recoverable as such. 
         
        … 
         
        (12) The Supreme Court may, when it makes a proceeds assessment order at any later time, make any ancillary orders that the Court considers appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        28 Assessment of proceeds of serious crime related activity 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (1) For the purpose of making an assessment under section 27 in relation to the proceeds derived by a person (in this section called  
        the defendant 
        ) from an illegal activity, or illegal activities, of the person or another person the Supreme Court is to have regard to the following matters:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) the money, or the value of any interest in property other than money, directly or indirectly acquired by:  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (i) the defendant, or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) another person at the request, or by the direction, of the defendant, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        because of the illegal activity or activities, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) the value of any service, benefit or advantage provided for:  
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (i) the defendant, or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) another person at the request, or by the direction, of the defendant, 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        because of the illegal activity or activities, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) the market value, at the time of the illegal activity or of each illegal activity, of a plant or drug similar, or substantially similar, to any involved in the illegal activity or each illegal activity, and the amount that was, or the range of amounts that were, ordinarily paid for an act similar, or substantially similar, to the illegal activity or each illegal activity, 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (d) the value of the defendant’s property before and after the illegal activity or each illegal activity, 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (e) the defendant’s income and expenditure before and after the illegal activity or activities. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) If evidence is given at the hearing of an application for a proceeds assessment order that the value of the defendant’s property after an illegal activity or illegal activities of the defendant exceeded the value of the defendant’s property before the activity or activities, the Supreme Court is to treat the excess as proceeds derived by the defendant from the activity or activities, except to the extent (if any) that the Supreme Court is satisfied the excess was due to causes unrelated to an illegal activity or activities. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3) If evidence is given at the hearing of an application for a proceeds assessment order of the amount of the defendant’s expenditure during the period of 6 years before the making of the application for the order, the Supreme Court is to treat any such amount as proceeds derived by the defendant from an illegal activity or activities, except to the extent (if any) that the Supreme Court is satisfied the expenditure was funded from income, or money from other sources, unrelated to an illegal activity or activities. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3A) The Supreme Court is not to take expenditure into account under subsection (3) to the extent that the Court is satisfied that it resulted in the acquisition of property the value of which is taken into account under subsection (2). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (4) In making an assessment as provided by this section, none of the following amounts are to be subtracted:

        (b) a member of the Australian Federal Police, or 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) an officer of Customs within the meaning of the

        (d) a member or officer of the Commission, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        who is experienced in the investigation of illegal activities involving plants or drugs, being an opinion with respect to:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (e) the amount that was the market value at a particular time of a particular kind of plant or drug, or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (f) the amount, or range of amounts, ordinarily paid at a particular time for the doing of anything in relation to a particular kind of plant or drug. 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
      The proper construction of the Act and decision on appeal 
      
    29 The first matter of importance in the structure of the Act is that the orders under ss 22 and 27 are made by reference to different criteria. A forfeiture order must be made by the Court under s 22(2) in relation to any property in respect of which the relevant person the subject of suspicion and of proof has a specified interest. If the Court finds it more probable than not that that person (whose suspected serious crime related activity formed the basis of the restraining order under s 10) was, in the last six years, engaged in a relevant serious crime related activity, it must make an assets forfeiture order against that person’s property, to the extent it can be identified: see s 22(4). Such property may have been purchased at any time. It may have been given to the person. The basis for the order under s 22(2) is not that it is proven that proceeds of crime have funded its acquisition, either in whole or in part.  
     
      
    30 The order under s 27, on the one hand, is made by reference to the value of proceeds derived from an illegal activity in the prior six years. It is based on a calculation (such as can be proved by the appellant) as to proceeds in that period. 
     
      
    31 The forfeiture under s 22(2) is as to property that may have not been purchased directly or indirectly by the proceeds that the appellant can prove were illegally derived in the six years. The Act calls for no investigation of that issue. Yet, the primary judge saw ss 27 and 22 as necessarily complementing each other such that “value” in s 27 was to take into account the value of property forfeited under s 22(2). 
     
      
    32 The basis for forfeiture under s 22(2A), being directed to the acquisition of property, can be seen to have a possibly closer relationship to s 27 than does s 22(2). Nevertheless, there is no clear identity of foundation in ss 22(2A) and 27. For instance, there is no six-year period in s 22(2A), as there is in s 27. 
     
      
    33 Sections 22(8) and 27(6), though not directed to calculation of value in s 28, are a clear indication of the independent operation of the two orders, the statutory bases for which are in separate Divisions of Part 3. No attempt was made in this context to express any regime for their complementary or contemporaneous operation. 
     
      
    34 The Act has a number of provisions for the amelioration of the rigours of its application. As to forfeiture orders, under ss 24, 25 and 26, applications can be made on behalf of dependants for orders to ameliorate the effect of forfeiture and applications can be made to excise property, or interests in the property, from forfeiture. The provisions contain clear criteria and a clear onus of proof. The avoidance of some double counting is expressly dealt with in the calculation of proceeds: see ss 28(2), (3) and (3A). 
     
      
    35 The Court’s role is clearly laid down at all stages. Its powers are clearly circumscribed.  
     
      
    36 In these circumstances, it would be curious to imply, by a process of construction and interpretation, an ameliorating provision or power, available to be used by the Court in circumstances it thought fair. 
     
      
    37 It is true that s 27 uses the word “value”. That can be easily understood by reference to the assessment task in s 28. The proceeds may be in the form of money or other kinds of property to which a monetary value must be given. 
     
      
    38 The assessment task set out in s 28 is an apparently comprehensive and complete regime. Section 28 sets out relevant considerations (s 28(1)) and the kinds of evidence that can be led with relevant consequences (s 28(2) and (3)). For instance, s 28(3) is clear that the Court “is to treat” the amount of expenditure in the period as relevant proceeds. This is not an indication of flexibility as the primary judge thought. 
     
      
    39 It can also be seen that in s 28 the proceeds are calculated without regard to the costs or outgoings of the criminal operation: s 28(4)(a) and without regard whether proceeds are derived as an agent: s 28(4)(b). From one perspective, neither of these provisions is fair. 
     
      
    40 The terms and structure of Parts 2 and 3, and Divisions 1 and 2 of Part 3 in particular, do not display any intention to be fair beyond those specific provisions that deal with amelioration of the effects of the Act. 
     
      
    41 The Act does not reflect a use of finely balanced processes of accounting; yet, that kind of accounting (a 100% tax, but no more) appeared to influence the primary judge. 
     
      
    42 For there to be a link between ss 27 and 22 through the vehicle of the word “value” in s 27(1) more would be required than a mere recognition that property of the person, who has been ordered to pay an amount under s 27, was forfeited under s 22 and investing the word “value” with some plasticity. The value of the forfeited property would need to be assessed. This would give rise to a valuation case. Who would bear the onus in such an exercise? The Act is silent. 
     
      
    43 If fairness is the implied criterion, value may not be the appropriate test. The acquisition cost would be a more appropriate reference point. Yet, it is difficult to imply this into “value” in s 27(1). 
     
      
    44 An enquiry would need to be made as to the proportion of value (or acquisition price) of the asset attributable to the proceeds the subject of the s 27 order. The Act does not provide for this. Who would bear the onus? One could imagine a complex financial investigation over many years to resolve this issue. 
     
      
    45 These kinds of factual enquiry (some involving a measure of precision and complexity) not otherwise provided for under the Act, would need to be made in circumstances where the evident purpose of the legislation is to throw on to persons who have engaged in serious criminal conduct the burden of proving the matters that Parliament has set out in sections such as ss 24, 25 and 26. 
     
      
    46 Further, to make ss 22 and 27 complement each other through the word value, as her Honour did, may be unfair to the Crown. Unless it can be proved that the proceeds calculated under s 28 for the order under s 27 did purchase (in full) the forfeited asset and that there were no other illegally derived proceeds, the approach of the primary judge may limit the recovery of assets that may have been illegally derived. Unless the Court were satisfied that the value of proceeds proved under s 28 for the order under s 27, was the extent of illegally derived proceeds that had been generated by the person, some double counting under ss 22 and 27 may not be “unjust”. The appellant proves what it can under s 28. It is then entitled to an order under s 27. That does not mean, however, that it can be assumed that all illegally derived proceeds have been identified. Double counting may be unfair, it may not be. To be concluded that it is, one would need to be satisfied of the full universe of illegally derived proceeds. 
     
      
    47 The kind of value judgements as to what is fair or not, what degree of precision is required and when double counting should be taken into account are all matters to which Parliament has directed itself expressly. 
     
      
    48 I see no ambiguity or lack of clarity in ss 27 and 28. The order under s 27 can be made even though an asset forfeiture order can also be made: s 27(6). The order under s 27 is in relation to the value of proceeds calculated by reference to s 28. 
     
      
    49 There is no basis to read into the word “value” in s 27(1), or into any part of s 27 any authority to deduct from a calculation made under s 28, a sum referable to the value of assets forfeited under another section in another Division of Part 3. 
     
      
    50 The above analysis does not take account of the approaches of similar statutes of the States and the Commonwealth. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Court asked the Commission to provide a note as to such statutes and how they treated, if they did, the question of any set-off in the orders for forfeited property. A helpful conspectus was provided by junior counsel. The respondent did not wish to add anything by way of further submission consequent upon the provision of this note by the Commission. 
     
      
    51 Each of the Commonwealth and the States has an Act comparable to the Act. All of the Acts (except that of Tasmania) provide for confiscation in the absence of conviction. All the Acts (except that of Western Australia) follow a broadly similar pattern. All of the Acts (except that of New South Wales) make express provision for adjusting the amount of the equivalent of a proceeds assessment order by reference to the making of a forfeiture or similar order. 
     
      
    52 In the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (Cth), s 130 provides for a reduction of a pecuniary penalty order on account of relevant forfeited property. Sections 131 and 132 provide for reductions on account of tax paid in respect of the offence and on account of any fine, compensation, damages or restitution paid in respect of the offence. Section 130 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        The penalty amount under a pecuniary penalty order against a person is reduced by an amount equal to the value, as at the time of the making of the order, of any property that is proceeds of the offence to which the order relates if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the property has been forfeited under this Act or another law of the Commonwealth or under a law of a non-governing Territory, in relation to the offence to which the order relates; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) an application has been made for a forfeiture order that would cover the property. 
        
       
      
    53 The Confiscation Act 1997 (Vic) makes provision for forfeiture orders and pecuniary penalty orders. Under s 63, dealing with pecuniary penalty orders, the Court is to assess the value of the benefits derived by the defendant in relation to an identified offence. In s 68(3), provision is made for the assessment of a pecuniary penalty in relation to the offence and an express provision is made for the non-inclusion of any property which is being forfeited to the Minister under the Act. 
     
      
    54 Under the Criminal Proceeds Confiscation Act 2002 (Qld), forfeiture orders and proceeds assessment orders can be made. The relationship between them is provided for in s 79(3), which gives the Supreme Court a power, if it considers it appropriate, to deduct from the value of the proceeds in a proceeds assessment order the value of any property forfeited under a forfeiture order made in relation to a person’s illegal activities. 
     
      
    55 Under the Criminal Assets Confiscation Act 2005 (SA) provision is made for forfeiture orders and pecuniary orders. Section 107 provides for the avoidance of double counting in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        If a pecuniary penalty order relates to benefits derived from the commission of a serious offence, the penalty amount under the order is reduced by an amount equal to the value, at the time of the making of the order, of any property that is proceeds of the serious offence if — 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the property has been forfeited, under this Act or any other law, in relation to the offence to which the order relates; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) an application has been made for a forfeiture order that would cover the property. 
        
       
      
    56 In the Criminal Property Confiscation Act 2000 (WA) there is a provision for the confiscation of “unexplained wealth”, “criminal benefits”, “crime-used property”, “crime-derived property” and the property of “declared drug-traffickers”; see ss 4, 144, 145, 146, 148 and 159. Provision is made for “freezing notices” and “freezing orders” (Pt 4) and for “unexplained wealth declarations” (Pt 3, Div 1) and “criminal benefits declarations” (Pt 3, Div 2). The relationship between the various orders is dealt with in ss 13 and 18. In s 13(4), when assessing the value of a respondent’s unexplained wealth, the Court is not to take account of, inter alia, “any property that has been confiscated under this Act or other enactment or any property, service, advantage or benefit in relation to which a criminal benefits declaration has been made”. Under s 18, dealing with criminal benefits declarations, it is provided that the Court is not to make a declaration in respect of property if: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) a criminal benefits declaration has already been made in relation the property, service, advantage or benefit; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the property, service, advantage or benefit has been confiscated under this Act or any other enactment; or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the property, service, advantage or benefit, or its value, has been taken into account for the purpose of making an unexplained wealth declaration against the respondent. 
        
       
      
    57 From the above provisions, it can be seen that all States, other than New South Wales, have made some provision in relation to possible double counting. Under the Commonwealth provision the property must relate to the offence to which the order relates. The Victorian provision is in relation to an offence. The Queensland provision gives a power to the Court. The South Australian Act requires a relationship between the forfeiture and the proceeds of a particular offence. 
     
      
    58 The provision by each of the States and Commonwealth reflects the underlying proposition in the reasons above that the matter is one for the express attention of Parliament. It was, and remains, open to the Parliament of New South Wales to legislate in relation to this issue. It is not a matter, in my view, legitimately within the province of interpretation and construction of the statute.  
     
      
    59 To the extent that the operation of the Act is or remains unfair that is a matter for Parliament to remedy.  
     
      
    60 The material provided by the Commission after the hearing threw light on how the issue in question had been treated by Parliaments in the Federation. The statutes, though later than the Act, were of some real assistance. In any proceeding in which the meaning of the Act falls for consideration, it would be generally helpful for the Court to be assisted by some understanding as to how cognate statutes in other States and the Commonwealth have dealt with the issue in question. 
     
      
       
      
    61 For the above reasons, I would make the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Appeal allowed. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       2. Order 2 made by the Court on 20 February 2008 be set aside. 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        3. Order that the respondent pay the Treasurer the sum of $401,356. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       4. The respondent pay the appellant’s costs. 
      
    62 GILES JA: I agree with Allsop P. 
     
      
    63 BELL JA: I agree with Allsop P.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him on 30 November 2007 in the District Court by Williams DCJ following his pleas of guilty to an indictment containing three counts. The counts were: 
     
      
       
      1. Robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon; 
       
       
      2. Knowingly deal in proceeds of crime; 
       
       
      3. Conduct dealings to avoid reporting requirements.  
       
       
      He asked, pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      1999 (“the  
      Sentencing Procedure Act 
      ”) that a further 2 offences on a Form 1 be taken into account. 
       
      
    3 The first offence on the indictment is an offence against s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years; the second is an offence against s 193(B)(1) of the same Act, and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. The third is an offence against s 31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth) and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. 
     
      
    4 Williams DCJ sentenced the applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1 
       (taking into account the additional offences): imprisonment for 10 years and 4 months commencing on 8 August 2006 with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months, expiring on 7 February 2013; 
       
       
      Count 2 
      : imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years commencing on 8 August 2007 and expiring on 7 August 2010; 
       
       
      Count 3 
      : imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years commencing on 13 August 2008 and expiring on 12 August 2010. 
       
      
    5 It will be seen that, although his Honour made the second and third sentences partly cumulative, each is fully subsumed in the non-parole period imposed in respect of the first. It is therefore the sentence imposed in respect of the first, and most serious, count, that is the subject of the application for leave to appeal. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    6 Although the offences are of a disparate nature, they were linked and were all part of a chain of criminality that began with the armed robbery. That offence was committed on 28 February 2006. On that day the applicant, in company with another man, and driving a vehicle bearing stolen number plates, accosted two Chubb security officers, Abdul Jodeh and Steve Adams, who were in the process of transferring bags containing a large sum of cash from a business at Mascot in an armoured vehicle. After Adams had placed the bags in the van and secured the door, the applicant pointed a black revolver at his chest. He demanded that the men hand him the bags. The applicant handed the security officers two bags, into which they placed satchels containing the money. The applicant took the bags and drove off, with the other man as passenger. 
     
      
    7 The proceeds of the robbery was the sum of almost $2,000,000.  
     
      
    8 Five days later, on 5 March 2006, the applicant purchased a Lexus motor vehicle for which he paid $27,500 in cash. This constitutes one of the additional offences on the Form 1. 
     
      
    9 On the same day he purchased a BMW motor vehicle, for the sum of $92,490 for which he paid by way of a trade-in, together with $87,750 in cash. This constitutes the offence the subject of the second count. 
     
      
    10 On 21 April 2006, in company with two relatives, he purchased at auction another BMW, bidding $79,979.70. He tendered this sum in cash, but was presented with an Austrac currency declaration, requiring disclosure of the source of the cash. The applicant and his relatives left, and purchased eight separate bank cheques, seven in the sum of $9,900 and one in the sum of $2,700. The purchase of the vehicle was the second offence on the Form 1 taken into account; the purchase of the bank cheques was an attempt to launder the stolen money and avoid the requirements of the Financial Transactions Reports Act, and constitutes the third offence on the indictment. 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    11 The applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. His wife did and his Honour had the benefit of a pre-sentence report, a number of psychiatric reports (concerning himself and members of his family) and two psychological reports. From these, the following subjective circumstances were disclosed. 
     
      
    12 The applicant was born in April 1977, in Australia, to Lebanese parents. He turned 29 during the course of this episode of criminal conduct. He is married and has two children. He has a minor criminal record which the sentencing judge regarded as insignificant. However, he told the psychologist and psychiatrist that he had been arrested in 1998 in connection with a shooting; he was refused bail and remained in custody for 6 months, but was ultimately discharged at committal. Whilst in custody, however, he became severely depressed and developed a heroin addiction; on his release that dependency continued, despite a number of attempts on his part to overcome it. Those attempts included a course of naltrexone, which caused kidney disease resulting in his hospitalisation and a continuing recurring condition. He has also undertaken methadone treatment programmes. Since being taken into custody in respect of the present offences, the applicant has become involved in Narcotics Anonymous and his progress appears to be satisfactory. He has received favourable reports on his prison conduct. 
     
      
    13 Notwithstanding his continued drug use (prior to his arrest) the applicant held and maintained responsible employment in the retail industry, and was regularly promoted. 
     
      
    14 The psychiatrist, Dr Neilssen, considered the applicant was suffering from depression and anxiety, which he attributed to his then current circumstances (in custody awaiting sentencing) but also thought that he had been depressed and anxious for some years before that, “in the context of his general history”. 
     
      
    15 This included a matter that the applicant did not disclose to the psychologist, Mr Watson-Munro, nor, it seems, to Dr Neilssen. The applicant’s father has long suffered from a number of psychiatric conditions, including major depression, anxiety and schizophrenia. He had made more than one attempt at suicide. 
     
      
    16 The applicant’s wife also has suffered from depression and anxiety. 
     
      
       
       
      The Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    17 Williams DCJ set out the facts of the offences, and the subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    18 Correctly, he held that the guideline sentence in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; 46 NSWLR 346 had no application. This was correct because of the obvious existence of significant planning in the offence, the amount of money stolen, and the applicant’s age. 
     
      
    19 His Honour noted a submission that the offence was attributable to the applicant’s heroin addiction, but expressed some scepticism about that, relying on the evidence of the applicant’s conduct after the robbery in purchasing the motor vehicles, and conversations of which evidence was given. To this might be added his ability to maintain employment. 
     
      
    20 His Honour found special circumstances within s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act “to a limited degree”. He discounted the sentences by twenty percent in recognition of the pleas of guilty, and some assistance given by the applicant to authorities, although his Honour had earlier expressed the view that such assistance as he had given was not of any substantial value. 
     
      
    21 His Honour recognised the need for “a substantial element” of general deterrence in the sentence and stated his intention of reflecting that in the sentence imposed.  
     
      
    22 Rather surprisingly, perhaps, he concluded that the offence fell “within the mid-point area of penalty for this offence”. 
     
      
    23 Specifically relevantly to the grounds of the application, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Apart from the obvious planning behind this offence, and no matter what Mr Eid’s condition may have been with regard to the effects of heroin, he was the person whose use of the weapon resulted in the victim being forced into the van and being deprived of cash. The weapon was loaded. Had the victim resisted the potential for serious injury or death was substantial.” 
        
       
       
       
      The grounds of the application 
       
      
    24 Three grounds of appeal were pleaded, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. His Honour erred in treating as an aggravating factor the presence of the firearm, even though it was an element of the offence; 
        
       
       
        
        2. His Honour erred in failing to sentence the applicant in accordance with the procedure provided for by s 44 of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        1999; and 
        
       
       
        
        3. The sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 1: the presence of the firearm as an aggravating factor 
       
      
    25 By s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, in determining sentence, a court is obliged to take into account relevant and known aggravating factors (and mitigating factors). S 21A(2) specifies the aggravating factors to be taken into account. One of these (in sub-paragraph lettered (c)), is the actual or threatened use of a weapon. 
     
      
    26 However the sub-section concludes with the direction that a court is not to have “additional regard” to any such aggravating factor in sentencing if it is an element of the offence. 
     
      
    27 The argument put on behalf of the applicant was that, in the passage of the Remarks on Sentence which I have extracted above, his Honour breached that prohibition and expressly took into account, as an aggravating factor, the presence of the weapon, which was, of course, an element of the offence charged. 
     
      
    28 The submission can be disposed of shortly. On any fair reading of the passage, it could not reasonably be held that his Honour regarded the presence of the weapon as an aggravating factor. The passage appears in the paragraph in which his Honour turned his attention to the guideline sentence of this Court in Henry, and held that it was inapplicable. He then went on to explain why that was so – the criteria specified in Henry were not met, by reason of “the obvious planning”. There is no reference to s 21A, and no reference to aggravating factors. Apart from excluding the application of the Henry guideline, the passage is only relevant to his Honour’s account of the objective gravity of the offence and the applicant’s participation in it. I would reject ground one of the application. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2:  
      Sentencing Procedure Act 
      , s 44 
       
      
    29 S 44(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence).” 
        
       
      
    30 In sentencing the applicant his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appropriate sentence for count 1 and the Form 1 matters without reduction was in my view 13 years imprisonment. I reduce that to 10 years and 4 months. I specify a minimum period in custody of 6 ½ years to date from 8 August 2006. He is thus eligible for release on 7 February 2013. The total term will expire on 7 December 2016.” 
        
       
      
    31 It is true that this manner of pronouncing sentence failed to comply with the directive of s 44(1); however, it is well established that s 44(1) does not require that the reasoning process begin with the selection of the non-parole period; it is the pronunciation of orders that is required to be done in that way. 
     
      
    32 In R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 Spigelman CJ described a similar error as: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … a technical error of little or no practical significance”. 
        
       
       
      He expressly held that the error did not affect the exercise of discretion by the sentencing judge, and that, unless some other aspect of the sentence warranted intervention, it was not necessary that the court take that course. 
       
      
    33 I would apply that reasoning to the present circumstances. The intention of the sentencing judge is perfectly clear. There is no error which this Court is called upon to correct. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: manifestly excessive? 
       
      
    34 Relied upon in this Court were two cases said to be comparable, in which sentences were imposed after trial; each of those offenders had been sentenced to imprisonment for 9 years: Huynh v R [2006] NSWCCA 224; Bain v R [2006] NSWCCA 79; 161 A Crim R 36. Although appeals against both sentences were dismissed, the sentences were described respectively as “severe” and “very severe”. 
     
      
    35 It is true that the applicant has the benefit of the sentencing judge’s finding that the offence called for a “mid-range” penalty, although, having regard to the amount of money stolen, and the level of planning inherent in the offence, that finding must be characterised as generous to the applicant. 
     
      
    36 Counsel for the applicant also sought to draw comfort from the standard non-parole period set by Parliament, pursuant to Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act not in relation to offences against s 97, (in respect of which there is no standard non-parole period) but in respect of offences against s 98. S 98 makes offences of armed robbery with wounding, or causing grievous bodily harm, and similarly carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years. That standard non-parole period is of 7 years; that is, of course, a standard non-parole period applicable where an offender has been convicted at trial: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168.  
     
      
    37 Offences against s 98 do have considerable parallels with offences against s 97; however, the Legislature has chosen not to specify a standard non-parole period in respect of s 97 offences, and only limited weight could be given to the s 98 standard non-parole period. But, in any event, the applicant had to be sentenced with due regard to the gravity of his offence, including the very large amount of money taken, and by reference to the maximum sentence prescribed by Parliament. 
     
      
    38 Against a maximum penalty of 25 years, a starting point of 13 years, before reduction for the pleas of guilty, was precisely the mid-point which his Honour determined was appropriate.  
     
      
    39 In my opinion it has not been shown that the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    40 I would reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
    41 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (1) leave granted to appeal; 
       
       
      (2) appeal dismissed. 
       
      
    42 I would, however, re-formulate the sentence to accord with the requirements of s 44(1). I therefore propose the following additional order: 
     
      
       
      (3) in respect of the first count, the applicant is sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years and 6 months, commencing on 8 August 2006 and expiring on 7 February 2013, and a balance of term of 3 years and 10 months, expiring on 7 December 2016.

    2 NETTLE AJA: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    3 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a series of sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 26 June 2007 following his pleas of guilty to five charges, and his admissions, pursuant to Pt 3, Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”) of a large number of other, related, offences. 
     
      
    4 Although the issue raised on the application is very narrow, it is, nevertheless, necessary to give an outline of the nature of the charges. In sum, the offences fell into five groups, all of dishonesty in one form or another. Three counts were of using a false instrument, two of disposing of stolen property. Attached to each count was a list of additional offences to be taken into account on a Form 1 under the Sentencing Procedure Act. In all, the applicant admitted his guilt of 46 additional offences. They encompassed further offences of using false instruments, obtaining benefits by deception, and stealing. 
     
      
    5 Each count of using a false instrument exposed the applicant to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years; each count of disposing of stolen property rendered him liable to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 years. The applicant was sentenced, cumulatively, to an overall term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months and a balance of term of 2 years and 9 months – that is, a head sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    6 The earliest offence was committed in March 2004; the latest in December 2005. The offences were committed as part of a sophisticated criminal enterprise, in conjunction with several other offenders. There was a distinct pattern to the offences. The offenders used companies or registered business names to establish apparent business enterprises. They established bank accounts using false names, and using false documents as identification. Using false documentation, such as drivers’ licences, they leased industrial premises, and purported to embark upon a business. They identified “victim” or “target” companies. They conducted an initial, apparently legitimate, transaction, in which they established business credibility; thereafter, they obtained, on credit, substantial items of property or equipment – on a number of occasions, items as substantial as forklift trucks. On one occasion, they also obtained a large consignment of raw coffee beans. 
     
      
    7 Having obtained the property, the offenders removed the items that had been delivered, and vacated the leased premises, without paying rent. They then disposed of the property.  
     
      
    8 It can be seen, and was not in contest, that the criminality was very serious indeed. 
     
      
       
       
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    9 The applicant made a substantial subjective case. He was motivated largely by a gambling addiction. He has some criminal history, which includes a number of prior offences of dishonesty, including one of making a false instrument and two of obtaining money by deception (ie offences of the same kind as those for which he stood to be sentenced). 
     
      
    10 Of present significance, included in the case made on his behalf in mitigation of penalty, was his past, and offered future, assistance to the authorities in the prosecution of his co-offenders. The past assistance took the form of an induced statement, which became part of the prosecution brief in the cases to be presented against the co-offenders. Eventually, all or most co-offenders entered pleas of guilty. 
     
      
    11 It was agreed that, on this basis, the applicant was entitled to a significant reduction in the penalty to be imposed. The quantification was not agreed. Counsel who appeared for the applicant on sentence urged a reduction, attributable both to the pleas of guilty and assistance, of fifty percent. In the result, the sentencing judge allowed a total discount of forty percent. To the extent that this was referable to assistance, it was only referable to assistance already given. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The offender has undertaken to give evidence against any other persons who may be charged in relation to these activities. His counsel submits to me that such a prospect is remote. I intend to allow him a discount for his co-operation with authorities and restrict it to the past. I take into account any future co-operation as indication of his continuing contrition.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    12 The applicant’s counsel had made a concession to the effect recorded by his Honour. 
     
      
       
       
       
      The application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    13 A single ground of the application was pleaded. It was: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “Fresh evidence is now available in relation to the appellant’s assistance to prosecution authorities that would have had a bearing on the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion so as to increase the discount given on sentence.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    14 The application was based upon the contents of an affidavit sworn by Mr Nicholas Hanna, solicitor for the applicant. Mr Hanna deposed that, on 18 May 2007, the applicant had given an undertaking to give evidence at any proceedings against two co-offenders, Messrs Jamal Skaf, and Ali Al-Hashimi; and further to: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “ … give active co-operation, including the giving of evidence truthfully and frankly in accordance with the electronic statement made by me between 1 February 2007 and 9 February 2007.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    15 The “electronic statement” is the document to which I have referred as “an induced statement”, a synopsis of which was Exhibit D in the sentencing proceedings. Exhibit D is a very detailed document, and contains reference to a number of individuals besides the two co-offenders mentioned above. One person so named, as a co-offender, was a person to whom I will refer as X. 
     
      
    16 Also before the court was a confidential document (Exhibit B), consisting of an affidavit sworn by a senior police officer, annexed to which was a comprehensive statement made by another police officer, apparently one who was involved in the investigation of the criminal enterprise to which the applicant was a party. The senior police officer assessed the evidence that the applicant promised to give against Skaf and Al-Hashimi as “vital”. 
     
      
    17 At that time, Al-Hashimi had entered guilty pleas to the charges he faced. Plea negotiations with Skaf were under way, and the officer anticipated that he, too, would enter pleas of guilty (as, indeed, he did). 
     
      
    18 So much was known at the time of sentencing, and was taken into account.  
     
      
    19 But Exhibit B went further. It named other persons in respect of whom the applicant had given information, and in respect of whom further investigation was in train. It envisaged the prospect of future prosecutions of these individuals. 
     
      
    20 The investigative officer noted that the applicant had given information about X, which, he anticipated, may have opened up a previously unlikely prospect of a prosecution against him. X had not then been charged. 
     
      
    21 Nevertheless, the officer assessed the value of the applicant’s assistance as “low to medium”. 
     
      
    22 Mr Hanna deposed to the following additional circumstances. Subsequent to the sentencing of the applicant, X was charged. The charges against him were listed for hearing in the Local Court at Bankstown on or about 17 March 2008. The applicant’s induced statement formed part of the brief of evidence to be presented against X. On the hearing date, X entered pleas of guilty. It was this that was propounded as fresh evidence upon which the application for leave to appeal was based. 
     
      
    23 At the time the ground was pleaded, the applicant’s present legal representatives had not had access to Exhibit B. When senior counsel who appeared for the applicant was shown Exhibit B he sought, and was granted, leave to amend the grounds by adding a ground in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour the sentencing judge erred in making no allowance by way of discount on the applicant’s sentence for future co-operation.” 
        
       
      
    24 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant, that, by reason of events post-dating sentence, his Honour’s assessment of the prospects of the applicant’s giving further evidence as “remote” was now shown to be unsustainable; and that the erroneous assessment resulted in the applicant’s being deprived of some measure of the discount to which he would have been entitled had the correct facts been known. 
     
      
       
       * * * 
       
      
    25 It is well established that events that post-date sentence are not available to be used as a basis for disturbing the sentence imposed at first instance. This is because this Court is a court of error, and error cannot be demonstrated by circumstances that did not exist at the time of sentencing: see R v Willard [2001] NSWCCA 6; Application of Antoun El Hani [2007] NSWSC 330; R v Scullion, (unreported, NSWCCA, 15 July 1992); R v MJM [2004] NSWCCA 66. 
     
      
    26 However, the authorities draw a distinction, not always clearly, between events or circumstances that did not exist at, or that post-date, sentencing, and events or circumstances relevant to, and casting new light on, circumstances that did exist and were known, although, perhaps, imperfectly, at the time of sentencing. The most frequent example of this is new or additional information concerning a medical condition an offender is known at the time of sentencing to have suffered.  
     
      
    27 When the circumstances of this case are closely examined, the present case is analogous. The applicant had provided relevant information; he had undertaken to follow up the provision of information by giving evidence. What was not fully appreciated was what that undertaking would involve in practical terms. That X would be charged was not then certain. 
     
      
    28 The concession made by the applicant’s legal representative, and adopted then by his Honour, is not in accord with the evidence that was before the court. His Honour referred to Exhibit B but made no reference to what was said by the officer about future assistance possibly to be given by the applicant. 
     
      
    29 There are two aspects to co-operation with prosecuting authorities in respect of which a discount on sentence might be allowed. One is the provision of information. That, potentially, exposes the offender to some danger, which provides part of the rationale for the discount; the second is the giving of, or the willingness to give, evidence. That, because it cannot be concealed, potentially exposes the offender to considerably greater danger, and justifies a more significant reduction. 
     
      
    30 Here, it might be assumed, the applicant had completed the first phase of his co-operation; he had provided all of the information he was able, or willing, to provide. But there remained a significant part of the second; the giving of, or the willingness to give, evidence against Skaf and X. 
     
      
    31 There was no basis in the evidence for counsel for the applicant to assess that prospect adversely to the applicant, as “remote”, nor for the judge to accept it. It represents a misconception of the effect of Exhibit B. That misconception can be more clearly seen because of the post-sentence events. 
     
      
    32 However, that does not conclude the issue. 
     
      
    33 S 23 of the Sentencing Procedure Act expressly recognises the approach to sentencing that permits a reduction, by reason of co-operation with authorities, in the sentence that would otherwise be imposed. But s 23(3) provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “A lesser penalty that is imposed under this section in relation to an offence must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    34 It is also necessary to take into account the value of the assistance given. Perhaps surprisingly, the assessment before the court, not challenged in any way, was that the value was “low to moderate”. 
     
      
    35 Having regard to the magnitude of the offending, and the extended period over which it was committed, the value of property involved, and the limited value of the assistance it was submitted on behalf of the Crown that any sentence less than that imposed would come in conflict with s 23(3).  
     
      
    36 In my opinion that submission must be accepted. Any sentence less than that imposed would be inadequate to meet sentence requirements. 
     
      
    37 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

      JUDGMENT - On Crown roadmap document and introductory remarks to the Jury 
       
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The Crown has prepared a document which it proposes to give to the jury. I marked it in its original form as MFI 1, and an amended form has now been marked as MFI 4. This is the first matter argued before me today. 
     
      
    2 It is, in essence, a roadmap or a chronology, if you like, of the facts to be alleged and sought to be proved by the Crown. It has been prepared in such a way that it will enable the jury to use the document as an aid in relation to an understanding of the unfolding of the evidence. The document does have on it a column which, I suppose, might enable jurors to make any comment in relation to evidence that is received on the particular point, but its main utility is that when a witness is called, or a document or other item is tendered, the jury can be directed to the entry on the roadmap so they can then know where the evidence is that is alleged to fit into the Crown case. As I understand, the document is to be consistent with the Crown opening.  
     
      
    3 In my opinion, in a trial of this factual complexity and length, a roadmap of the kind represented by MFI 4 is really essential. Without such assistance the jury would be likely to become completely lost. Without some guidepost or direction of this kind, the jury would be likely to simply flounder in a sea of uncertainty. They need a sense of direction, and this document is designed to achieve just that result.  
     
      
    4 Mr Button of senior counsel had originally argued that the jury might give too much weight to the document and that there would be a temptation to use it as a template of agreed facts or facts proved simply by assertion. In the light, however, of a sensible Crown amendment to the document (see top of page 1 of MFI 4), Mr Button has not pressed his objection. Mr Scragg took a similar position and in the end his further suggestion is also to be adopted.  
     
      
    5 Mr Waterstreet for Khaled Cheikho, however, has maintained his overall objection to the document. He has argued that the roadmap will distract the jury from the unfolding of the evidence. He submitted that it may operate as something of a ""tick list"". Secondly, counsel argued that the document is tantamount to giving the jury a schedule of the overt acts relied upon by the Crown which, he suggested, would be impermissible at this stage. Thirdly, it was argued the document does not make it clear what is admissible and, importantly, against whom it may be admissible.  
     
      
    6 As to these last points, it may be simply observed that the document is not, nor does it purport to be, a schedule of overt acts. It is no more than a roadmap outlining in chronological sequence the factual allegations the Crown suggests will arise from the evidence to be called. Secondly, it is not designed to address issues of admissibility, although the Crown will make it clear, as I understand it, that items 1 to 3 in MFI 4 are only sought to be, if proved, admissible against Moustafa Cheikho.  
     
      
    7 My overall response to Mr Waterstreet's submission in relation to MFI 4 is that counsel seems to be arguing from a template that has been well and truly superseded by contemporary trial practice. Inadvertently or otherwise, the submission appears to countenance the proposition that it is appropriate for the jury to be allowed, as it were, to stumble along amidst a morass of uncertainty in this rather factually complicated and detailed trial. In my view, however, that situation should not be allowed to happen.  
     
      
    8 The roadmap may be distributed to the jury as the Crown wishes to do so, and the document should be amended in a way that incorporates Mr Scragg's further suggestion as to “headings” on each page. 
     
      
    9 The second matter argued relates to draft directions to be given to the Jury. 
     
      
    10 It is customary for the Trial Judge to make preliminary remarks to the jury before the Crown opening. I distributed to the parties some little time ago a draft of some brief general directions I propose to give the jury during the course of these preliminary remarks. The document I distributed related to one section only of the introductory remarks. It related to a preliminary direction on legal issues likely to arise in the trial.  
     
      
    11 Essentially, the directions identified very briefly the ingredients of the offence contained in the indictment and focused on one aspect, namely, the definition of ""a terrorist act"" as appearing in the Commonwealth Code Act. The purpose of the direction was to direct the jury's collective mind to the nature of a terrorist act as it is defined in the legislation.  
     
      
    12 The point of importance, as I saw it, was to stress right from the outset that unless the Crown can prove beyond reasonable doubt that each accused was a participant in an agreement to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts, and that the agreement was of that precise kind and no other, the Crown case must fail. The importance of the direction, consequently, was to explain what is a terrorist act and, significantly, what is not a terrorist act. I marked the original form of the extract from the introductory oral remarks as MFI 2. I have since revised it as a consequence of written submissions received from a number of the parties. The revised document is marked MFI 5 and the definition/written direction is MFI 6.  
     
      
    13 Ms Yehia for Mr Hasan had originally taken three exceptions to MFI 2. First, there was objection to the reference in a hypothetical example to a bombing in the Westfield Plaza at Parramatta. I have altered that reference to a more neutral location, but at the same time have preserved the same point intended to be made by the original example. Secondly, there was an objection to a reference to a further example, namely, the infamous Bali bombings.  
     
      
    14 For my part, I do not see any real problem with this example. It is well removed from any factual allegation made in this case. It is, I accept, an emotional issue and the jury members have been, and undoubtedly will be, consistently reminded to approach the evidence and the issues of this trial without bias. It is, however, as Ms Yehia said, a topical issue and, particularly in the days leading up to the Crown opening, it is likely to remain a topical issue. The jury will have to live with a number of topical issues throughout the duration of this lengthy trial. It is not to be supposed that the horrors of terrorist activity in Iraq or Afghanistan, Indonesia, Pakistan and other places will conveniently stop during this trial. We live in a real world. The jurors live in a real world. It is a world filled with daily examples of man's inhumanity to man, and to woman, for that matter. 
     
      
    15 The Bali example seemed to me to be a useful one to make the point I wanted to make in the direction. But I have heard further argument on it today, and I take the view that it is not an essential example. It was merely selected for convenience's sake. If the parties are unhappy about it in these opening remarks, then I am content to remove it and replace it with a reference to a more neutral terrorist activity, at least in a geographical and temporal sense. It has been suggested that I might replace it by a reference to terrorist activity by the Irish Republican Army, and I will do so. 
     
      
    16 Mr Scragg also raised a concern about another example I used, namely reference to the Madrid bombings, and I am content to remove that as well, in view of the submissions made today. 
     
      
    17 The third point originally made by Ms Yehia related to the part of the direction that briefly sought to explain the nature of a circumstantial case. I chose to use a simile to describe a circumstantial case, and the approach to such a case, by adopting the analogy of a jigsaw puzzle or a mosaic. Miss Yehia was concerned that the analogy might be misleading because it could convey the notion that a markedly incomplete picture might be sufficient to satisfy the onus of proof placed upon the Crown. 
     
      
    18 Once again, for my part, I think the analogy is a useful one for a jury to understand. It is, of course, only an analogy. It is no substitute for the appropriate and accepted standard set of directions in relation to circumstantial evidence in a circumstantial case. 
     
      
    19 I do not propose to discard the analogy. I have, however, endeavoured to strengthen the wording to reflect the point made by Ms Yehia, and I have also added in the passage occurring in R v Plomp (1963) 10 CLR 234 at 252, which was referred to by counsel in the written submissions. 
     
      
    20 Overall, I think the preliminary direction as to the nature of the circumstantial case and the matters that have to be proved by the Crown in discharge of the onus of proof, viewed as a whole, is adequate to address the issue. I have, however, modified the last section now to accord with further suggestions raised with me today. Those modifications will appear, if I am otherwise satisfied that the directions should be given. 
     
      
    21 Mr Button for Moustafa Cheikho had a different concern in his original submissions. His client is alleged to have trained with Lashkar-e-Taiba in Pakistan in 2001. This is a fact very much in issue in the trial. The Crown case will rely, in part, on identification or recognition evidence to be given by a witness who himself trained in an LeT camp in 2001. 
     
      
    22 Mr Button argued that this fact may be a fact that itself must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. It would not, in terms of its proof, be treated as merely a circumstantial fact, counsel argued. Mr Button accepted, of course, if it were proved against his client, it might then be viewed appropriately as a circumstantial matter in the case against him, but its proof, Senior Counsel argued, was or might be a matter to be proved to a higher standard than as was the case with the broad range of facts involved in the Crown's circumstantial case. 
     
      
    23 I have not heard adequate argument on this matter during the various pre-trial arguments to make a final determination about the standard of proof necessary on the identification point. For that reason, I will not make a final decision about it at this stage. 
     
      
    24 Assuming the correctness of the point, however, for the sake of the argument, I concluded that the draft direction did need an adjustment. I have made that adjustment in the revised direction, MFI 4, and I understand Mr Button is content with that position, for the time being. 
     
      
    25 The third and final submission came from Messrs Waterstreet and Lange, who represent Khaled Cheikho. Surprisingly, this submission was that no written or oral direction of the kind represented in MFI’s 1 and 4 should be given at all at this stage. I say ""surprisingly"" because it seemed to me to be inherent in this submission that counsel regarded it as appropriate that the jury should be launched upon this lengthy and factually detailed trial without any proper understanding of the nature of the charge, and of the issues likely to arise. Such an approach stands in stark contrast to any measured attempt to help the jury to understand the issues. Be that as it may, I am perfectly satisfied that this submission is without merit and is contrary to principle. 
     
      
    26 First, there is a statutory power to give written directions to a jury (see s 55B of the Jury Act 1977). The section is not confined or limited in any temporal sense. Mr Waterstreet suggested that it should be limited, because of its context. Counsel was unable, however, to point to any contextual matter that supported such a proposition. 
     
      
    27 Section 55B, indeed, appears in Pt 8, which deals with proceedings upon trial. A number of the sections in Pt 8 make it clear that the express powers conferred upon a trial Judge arising under this part of the Act may be exercised at any stage of the trial. 
     
      
    28 It is sufficient, I think, to point to s 54(1)(a), which permits, unless the Court otherwise orders, the jury to separate at any time before they retire to consider their verdict. That section obviously has operation from the very first day of the trial. 
     
      
    29 If it is not too trivial to mention, s 55, which appears in the same Part, enables the Court to permit the members of the jury to be supplied with refreshments at any time after they have been sworn. It could not be suggested, I would think, that the context of that section is limited to the conclusion of the evidence or after counsel had made their addresses. So, it is, I think, with s 55B and also s 55C, which deal with the power to give written directions and the power to provide a copy of all or any part of the transcript of evidence to the jury upon the jury's or a juror's request. The ability to provide a transcript, within the terms of the section, is one that arises from the outset of the trial. 
     
      
    30 There are other sections in Pt 8 as well, such as examination of jurors under ss 55D and 55DA, which clearly are powers arising generally throughout the trial. On the other hand, there are some sections, like s 54(1)(b) and s 55E, which plainly only arise at a later stage. Overall, as I say, it seems to me that there is no contextual basis for submitting that s 55B is confined in any temporal sense. 
     
      
    31 Secondly, the giving of directions generally throughout the trial is a matter that, in New South Wales at least, is common indeed, very common. Indeed, the failure to do so may, in a given case, raise the prospect of a serious error. The ability to give oral directions at any time must extend, where appropriate, to supplementing the oral directions with a written one. 
     
      
    32 Thirdly, quite apart from the powers expressly conferred on a Judge by the Jury Act to provide transcript and directions in writing, the trial Judge has an inherent or implied power to address issues of this kind (R v Taousanis (1999) 146 A Crim R 303 at 305-7, per Sperling J, approved by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Sukkar (2005) NSWCCA 54 at 8 per Wood CJ at CL, with whom Hidden J at 155 agreed, and, on this point, 207 per Smart AJ. See also R v Bartle [2003] NSWCCA 329 at 669, 672 and (684 to 693) per Smart J; Mason P and Barr J at 184 and 283.) 
     
      
    33 In my view, it is appropriate to give directions of the kind identified in MFI 5 and 6 at the very outset of this trial. I accept that this is unusual. But this is an unusual trial. It is to be a very long and detailed factual trial. In my estimate, the jury needs some brief guidelines, accurate but brief, as to the legal issues likely to arise, and they need that assistance at the very commencement of the trial.  
     
      
    34 Fourthly, it cannot be the case, as Mr Lange's written submissions suggested, that the Court, after nine months of protracted arguments and judgments, has no inkling of the issues likely to arise, for example, in the case of Khaled Cheikho. Quite apart from anything else, the accused has pleaded not guilty to the charge. This puts directly in issue, as have the majority of pre-trial arguments addressing various issues raised by Khaled Cheikho, whether he was or was not a participant in an agreement to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. 
     
      
    35 In addition, as I mentioned during argument this morning, yesterday there was a legal argument about a completely unrelated issue. The argument involved a contest between Khaled Cheikho and the Commonwealth and State agencies. During this argument, Mr Lange himself stated, as appears at page 2839 of the transcript, that his client's case would simply be that nothing was done by his client, nor was any conversation had by his client, in order to facilitate a terrorist act or was in any way connected with a terrorist act.  
     
      
    36 Mr Waterstreet today suggested that this statement should be read entirely in the context of the argument that was held yesterday, namely, an argument as to whether subpoenas should be set aside on the basis that they showed no legitimate forensic purpose. But for my part, I do not read Mr Lange's statement in that limited way in its context. It is clearly an overall statement of his client's case and, indeed, that is the case I have understood Khaled Cheikho would be raising, and I have so understood it really since much earlier this year when a number of arguments were raised on his behalf.  
     
      
    37 In any event, how could it be sensibly suggested having regard to the situation I have described, arising from the charge and the plea, that the jury should not be told briefly and succinctly what a terrorist act is? How could it be sensibly suggested they should not be told what a terrorist act is not? The answer to each question must emphatically be answered, in my opinion, that it could not be so suggested.  
     
      
    38 Mr Waterstreet's submission, with all due respect, appears to be postulated on the assumption that the jury, so far as possible, should be kept in the dark for as long as possible. Far from being a distraction, the provision of such a direction will provide a focus, and a sharp one at that.  
     
      
    39 It only remains briefly to dispose of some of the detailed submissions made by Mr Waterstreet and Mr Lange. I will not address all of them. The principal ones appear to be those that I now turn to describe.  
     
      
    40 First, it was submitted that there is a danger in providing written directions at any stage of the trial. The authority for this was The Queen v Radford (1986) 133 LSJS in a passage from King CJ at 110. This was a South Australian case that was decided over twenty years ago. That, I would respectfully suggest, is not the modern view. Indeed, the opposite point of view is now really the norm. Written directions provide a very useful assistance to juries. While it is true that juries are told that they are to pay careful attention to the oral directions and should not use the written directions in substitution for the full oral directions, this does not mean that the written direction is not of value. Indeed, as I have said, I think in a case such as the present it can be of very significant value. It should, of course, be accompanied by an oral direction, and that is precisely what I propose to do in the present matter.  
     
      
    41 It was next submitted that directions should not be given until the issues are settled. I accept that this may be so, say, for example, in a murder trial, where issues of self-defence, provocation or accident may arise, but are not known at the outset. The position in this trial, however, is quite different. It is, in my view, important for the jury to know at the outset what a terrorist act is and, as I have said, what it is not.  
     
      
    42 Clarity on this issue at the earliest time represents a fundamental issue of fairness for each of the accused. That appears to me to have been quite overlooked by Mr Waterstreet in his submissions. If it also happens to provide some degree of clarity to the Crown case, so be it. That, however, is not its primary purpose. It is essentially designed to assist the jury in understanding an important issue that is certain to arise in this trial. The corollary to that proposition is that, if there is not a clear understanding of the point at the outset, the jury may well be led into a misunderstanding where they may act unfairly towards the accused. It is very much with that in mind that I consider a direction should be given, and I think it is not without some importance that of all the experienced counsel here, it is only Mr Waterstreet of counsel and Mr Lange, his junior, who take the point that no direction should be given at all at the outset.  
     
      
    43 Counsel next submitted that the directions would not spell out all the ingredients of the offence but would emphasise one sensational element, namely, a terrorist act. I do not agree. The draft direction does state all of the ingredients of the offence and does not in any way sensationalise the one ingredient. This trial is about an allegation of terrorist activity, in any event. It can hardly be a valid criticism to state that this is the position, or to direct the jury's direction to it in a measured and appropriate manner.  
     
      
    44 Counsel then submitted that the direction contains no reference to the onus of proof and standard of proof. With all due respect, I would respond that it does, albeit briefly. But, in any event, the full version of the introductory remarks will deal with these matters in a comprehensive way, indeed in the usual way.  
     
      
    45 Finally, Mr Waterstreet made reference to The Queen v MM (2004) NSWCCA 81. That decision, which I have read quickly this morning, appears to be of no particular assistance in relation to Mr Waterstreet's argument. In that case, it was asserted that the Crown had in its final address effectively undermined the subsequent legal directions given by the trial judge. The situation that arose in the trial was, according to the decision, created by the defence opening which had transgressed the limits set by s 159 of the Criminal Procedure Act. As Howie J, one of the members of the Court observed, this almost caused the trial to miscarry. However, the irregularities did not lead to the appeal being allowed. The appeal was ultimately dismissed. I have read the decision of all three members of the Court carefully, but I can find no support for any of the propositions advanced by Mr Waterstreet in his argument.  
     
      
    46 For what it is worth, I will direct the parties' attention to paragraph 155 of the decision. It is not, strictly speaking, relevant to this decision I am giving today. I would however, simply remind counsel that if the defence are going to make an opening address to the jury, and it has been my understanding to date that they may well do so, each counsel should bear in mind the remarks of Howie J in that paragraph as to the limits of the matters that properly may be raised in such an opening. Indeed, Howie J went on to say this: 
     
      
       
        
        “As an opening address by the Crown should not contain any argument or submission to the jury as to the validity of its case, so the matters disclosed in the Prosecutor's address referred to in the section, cannot be arguments or submissions arising from the nature of the evidence to be called by the Crown. Nor should matters be raised by the accused person be taken to include defence arguments and submissions based upon the Crown evidence or evidence which may be called in the defence case.” 
        
       
      
    47 I think it is a useful reminder to both the Crown and the defence that there are limitations on the opening, and I trust that they will be observed in the present matter.  
     
      
    48 Those then are the reasons for the decision I have made to allow both the chronology and, subject to the amendments I have made, introductory remarks contained in MFI 5 and the written direction in MFI 6.

     Stuart Leslie WOOD v R 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I have had the considerable benefit of reading in draft the judgment of Simpson J. I regret that I do not agree with her Honour’s conclusion. 
     
      
    2 Her Honour has drawn attention to the sentencing statistics which have been collected for the relevant offences. The statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission are a valuable body of information and can provide guidance to sentencing judges. They can give an indication of the range of sentences which courts have imposed over time. However, notwithstanding the contribution which the statistics can make to consistency it is important in each case to consider the individual offence and the offender’s relevant statutory regime when sentencing in a particular case. Unless this is done in each case there is a risk that reliance on the statistics will inappropriately confine the range of sentences for particular offences. The result may be that both the maximum sentence and, where relevant the standard non-parole period will not be reflected in individual sentences. 
     
      
    3 In the present case the first count carries a maximum penalty of twenty years with a standard non-parole period of ten years. I agree with the sentencing judge that the offence was less than a mid-range offence. The quantity of drug dealt was not insignificant but was not at a level which would make this a mid-range offence. However, it was not in my opinion substantially below the mid-range. Recognising that the applicant pleaded guilty I am not persuaded that the sentence imposed at first instance was not within the appropriate range. In my judgment the sentencing judge did not err so as to permit the intervention of this Court. 
     
      
    4 Although I would grant leave to appeal I would dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    5 NETTLE AJA: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    6 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of sentences imposed upon him by Black DCJ in the District Court at Lismore on 14 December 2007 following his pleas of guilty to 3 counts of supplying prohibited drugs, contrary to s 25(2) (1 offence) and s 25(1) (2 offences) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (“the Drug Misuse Act”). 
     
      
    7 The offences to which the applicant pleaded guilty were:  
     
      
       
      count 1 
      : supply not less than the commercial quantity of MDMA (ecstasy); 
       
       
      count 2 
      : supply not less than the indictable quantity of MDMA; 
       
       
      count  
      3: supply not less than the indictable quantity of ketamine. 
       
      
    8 In addition, the applicant asked, pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”) that a further offence (of supplying a small quantity of methylamphetamine) be taken into account. 
     
      
       
       
      
    9 In respect of the first count, the applicant was liable to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. By Pt 4 Div 1A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, in respect of this offence a standard non-parole period of 10 years is fixed (see below). 
     
      
    10 On each of the remaining charges the applicant was liable to a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 15 years. No standard non-parole period is fixed. 
     
      
    11 Black DCJ imposed the following sentences: 
     
      
       
      count 1 
       (taking into account the offence on the Form 1): imprisonment for 6 years, commencing on 16 November 2005, with a non-parole period of 3 ½ years; 
       
       
      count 2 
      : a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years, commencing on 16 November 2005; 
       
       
      count 3 
      : a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years, commencing on 16 November 2006. 
       
      
    12 Notwithstanding the partial accumulation of the sentence imposed in respect of the third count, those imposed in respect of counts 2 and 3 were fully subsumed in the non-parole imposed in respect of count 1. 
     
      
    13 In structuring the sentences as he did, his Honour found, pursuant to section 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, that special circumstances existed justifying departure from the ratio between the head sentence and the non-parole period there specified. 
     
      
       
       
       
       
      The facts 
       
      
    14 The relevant facts are in very short compass. All offences were committed over a period of one month, in September and October 2005, in Kingscliff in northern NSW. 
     
      
    15 On the first occasion, 29 September, the applicant met a person who happened to be an undercover police operative at a hotel. He agreed to supply 1,000 ecstasy tablets, and almost immediately thereafter handed the operative a bag containing 999 tablets of the drug, together with a small amount (0.39 grams) of methylamphetamine, for which he made no charge. The undercover operative handed the applicant $16,500 in cash. The quantity of ecstasy was 321.4 grams.  
     
      
    16 Pursuant to s 3(1) and Schedule 1 of the Drug Misuse Act, a commercial quantity of ecstasy is between 0.125 grams and up to 0.5 kilograms, which quantity constitutes the large commercial quantity. 
     
      
    17 On the second occasion, 11 October, the undercover operative contacted the applicant and asked him to supply another 1,000 tablets. The applicant agreed, but told him that he could only supply 400 at that time and would attempt to obtain the remaining 600. No actual supply took place and no money changed hands. 
     
      
    18 On the third occasion, 27 October, the undercover operative again contacted the applicant, with the same request for 1,000 tablets. Later that day the applicant supplied 851 tablets of ketamine (343.2 grams) and was again paid $16,500. 
     
      
       
       
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    19 The applicant did not give evidence in the sentencing proceedings. Evidence of his subjective circumstances was provided to Black DCJ in the form of letters written by himself and his mother, a pre-sentence report, a psychiatric report of Dr John Roberts, and several testimonial letters. 
     
      
    20 The case they put was a strong one. 
     
      
    21 The applicant was born in October 1975 and was 30 years of age at the time of his offending. He has no criminal record. His early life was unremarkable, although his parents, both of whom had issues with alcohol, separated when he was quite young and this caused him to take on additional responsibility in caring for his younger brother. He seems to have coped quite well with this disruption to his life. 
     
      
    22 He is a married father of two small sons. He lives with his family in Currumbin, Queensland; he and his wife are in the process of purchasing their home. 
     
      
    23 He had had employment in the construction industry until about 2 years prior to his arrest. At that time he suffered a back injury at work, and thereafter was in receipt of social security benefits. 
     
      
    24 He had occasionally used illicit drugs – marijuana, ecstasy, amphetamines, cocaine and anabolic steroids – but was certainly not addicted and was more committed to a healthy lifestyle. 
     
      
    25 Dr Roberts considered that the history he took suggested the existence of depressive symptoms over a period (prior to his arrest) with some hint, not substantiated, of a bipolar disorder. The history suggests that the depressive symptoms were attributable to the work injury. He had no treatment for this condition until he was in custody, after his arrest. 
     
      
    26 The author of the pre-sentence report was generally favourable to the applicant although he expressed some scepticism about the extent to which the applicant accepted responsibility for his offending. He cited the applicant’s “workplace custodial officer” as describing the applicant as “the best worker he has had, one who has a positive influence on other inmates”. He suggested that the “prognosis” for the future (in terms of the likelihood of re-offending) was “favourable”. 
     
      
    27 The evidence showed that the applicant retained strong family support, in particular from his mother and his partner, who was in regular, virtually daily, contact with him. 
     
      
    28 In his letter the applicant expressed regret, recognition of the damage done to individuals and the community by drugs, and proffered apologies to his parents, his wife, her family and his children. He expressly recognised the hardship his incarceration caused to his wife and sons.  
     
      
    29 His mother’s letter gives an account of the applicant’s childhood, describing him as having been “a model child”, and as “genuinely contrite and remorseful” for his offending. 
     
      
       
      The remarks on sentence 
       
      
    30 Black DCJ recounted the facts of the offences. He accepted that the pleas of guilty had been entered at a time that entitled the applicant to a reduction in sentence, in accordance with principles stated in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, of twenty-five percent. Later, he said that, but for the pleas of guilty, the total substantive sentence would have been of 8 years imprisonment. His Honour noted the standard non-parole period applicable for the first count, but held that the applicant’s offence was less than a mid-range offence. The principal reason for this appears to have been that his Honour considered that the quantity of drug dealt with by the applicant was not “particularly enormous”, but he also made reference to “other factors” which he did not identify. 
     
      
    31 He also recognised that, by reason of the plea of guilty, the standard non-parole period did not strictly apply, although, in accordance with authority, it was relevant as: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “ … a reference point, or benchmark, or sounding board, or guidepost …”:  
          
         
        
       
       
      R v Way  
      [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. 
       
      
    32 His Honour noted the subjective factors, making specific reference to the letter from the applicant’s mother, and one of the testimonials, and the psychiatric report. He accepted the applicant’s expressed contrition as genuine; and found the prospects of rehabilitation to be “unusually good”. It was these last findings that prompted him to make the finding of special circumstances, thus enabling him to expand the parole period and reduce the non-parole period. 
     
      
    33 Having regard to the nature of the arguments advanced on behalf of the applicant, it is convenient to set out in full two passages from the remarks on sentence.  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “The two main reasons for going below it [the standard non-parole period] are first of all that this is a plea and therefore strictly speaking, the period does not apply. Secondly I see that the amount involved was something over twice what is identified as the commercial quantity. I am not really going to get involved in the sort of level of commercial supplies that can or cannot take place. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I would not have thought that this was a particularly enormous quantity, and that that is the reason why I will regard it as a lower than middle-of-the-road offence, without going any further into quantities or quantifications.”  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “Having said all that, it is now for me to identify the non-parole period … and I say that despite [counsel’s] forceful plea, partly because of the provisions about the standard non-parole period, but also because of the quantities involved in this case, it would be wrong in my view, for me to pass a sentence which allowed his either immediate or almost immediate release. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The non-parole period in my view, will have to be one of 3 ½ years” 
          
         
        
       
       
      The application for leave to appeal 
       
      
    34 Since, despite the partial accumulation of the sentence imposed in respect of the third count, all sentences are, in reality, to be served concurrently, the application concerns only the sentence imposed in respect of the first, and most serious, count. It was that sentence to which the argument was addressed. 
     
      
    35 Two grounds of appeal were advanced. They were pleaded as: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “1. The learned sentencing judge erred in his approach to the application of s 54B of the  
          Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
          1999 when determining the objective seriousness of the offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2. The learned sentencing judge gave insufficient weight to the applicant’s subjective circumstances.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      Ground 2: subjective circumstances 
       
      
    36 Counsel who appeared for the applicant chose to argue first, and most forcefully, the second ground. In support of this ground she argued that inadequate weight was given to the subjective circumstances, which I have outlined above. In particular, she argued that inadequate weight was given to the psychiatric evidence, that is, concerning the applicant’s depressive state. I do not accept that this is so. His Honour made adequate reference, although brief, to all matters. I would reject this ground of appeal.  
     
      
    37 This Court has considered on many occasions the ways in which evidence of psychiatric illness may be taken into account in mitigation of sentence: see, for example R v Letteri, (NSWCCA, 18 March 1992, Unreported); R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67; R v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81; R v Champion (1992) 64 A Crim R 244; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48; R v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267; R v Benitez [2006] NSWCCA 21. 
     
      
    38 It is sufficient to say that the applicant’s case does not fit really – or at all – into any of the formulations. To the extent that it was relevant, it was taken into account by Black DCJ. 
     
      
    39 Counsel also referred to the evidence of the applicant’s prior good character and the impressive assessment of his prison workplace supervisor. None of this persuades me that inadequate weight was given to any of the subjective circumstances or to the subjective case as a whole. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    40 In Way this Court held that the standard non-parole period applies to sentences for offences following a trial. Where a plea of guilty has been entered, the standard non-parole period continues to have application as a “reference point, or benchmark, or sounding board or guidepost”. S 54B of the Sentencing Procedure Act relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “1. … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2. When determining the sentence for the offence, the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          3. The reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in s 21A. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          4. … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          5. …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    41 (S 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act requires a sentencing court to take into account all relevant aggravating and mitigating features, and, in subs (2) and (3) sets out a catalogue of such features – and adds that any other relevant features not mentioned must also be taken into account.) 
     
      
    42 By s 54A(2) the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of the kind under consideration. 
     
      
    43 Thus, any relevant aggravating or mitigating factor is available to be taken into account in the determination of whether or not the standard non-parole period is to be set in respect of any individual offence. 
     
      
    44 The nub of the argument advanced in support of the first ground was drawn from statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission of NSW. The caution that must be exercised in the use of these statistics is well known. That is for a number of reasons, including that the bare statistics do not expose the relevant objective and subjective facts and circumstances which, together, are the key to the selection of the appropriate sentence in any individual case. With that caution in mind, the statistics serve a useful purpose in promoting consistency in sentencing, and therefore enhancing confidence in the criminal justice system. 
     
      
    45 In written submissions (not prepared by counsel who appeared on the application) it was put that analysis of the statistics reveals that the head sentence here imposed lies within the top twenty percent of sentences imposed, and the non-parole period lies in the top sixteen percent of all non-parole periods imposed, for offences of the kind to which the applicant pleaded guilty. No primary material was provided to support those percentages. The Crown did provide some material, less favourable to the applicant. Those figures showed that the applicant’s head sentence fell within the top twenty-eight percent of sentences imposed in respect of offences of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of prohibited drugs; and the non-parole period in the top thirty-one percent. (It may be that the discrepancy represents the pattern of sentencing since the applicant was sentenced.) It is of some significance that the documentation relied on by the Crown concerned only offences dealt with under the standard non-parole period regime introduced in 2003 by Pt 4 Div 1A. 
     
      
    46 In the written argument counsel focused heavily upon the quantity of the drugs involved. 
     
      
    47 In R v Wong; R v Leung [1999] NSWCCA 420; 48 NSWLR 340 this Court promulgated guideline sentences with respect to Commonwealth offences of importing prohibited drugs. The sentences proposed were graduated according to the weight or quantity of the drug involved. 
     
      
    48 On appeal, the High Court [Wong v The Queen; Leung v The Queen [2001] HCA 64; 207 CLR 584] allowed an appeal and set aside the orders there made. In doing so, five members of the Court rejected the proposition that the weight of a drug involved in such an offence is “the chief factor” to be taken into account in fixing sentences. Their Honours did not, however, exclude the quantity as one of a number of relevant circumstances to be taken into account. Gaudron, Gummow and Hayne JJ, in a joint judgment, said: 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “No doubt, within both of those categories [trafficable and commercial quantities], the particular amount of narcotic involved can have significance in fixing the sentence that is to be imposed on an offender.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    49 I have earlier set out the quantities which amount to a commercial quantity of ecstasy; it includes anything from 0.125 grams to anything up to but under 0.5 kilograms. In the applicant’s case, the quantity was a little over twice the commercial quantity, and a fraction of the upper limit of that quantity. 
     
      
    50 It may reasonably be assumed that the statistics on which the parties relied included supplies of the drug in substantially greater quantity than that the subject of the applicant’s offence. It may also be assumed that they include some offenders with prior criminal histories, and with subjective cases less favourable than that of the applicant. 
     
      
    51 In response to the applicant’s submissions, the Crown relied upon well-known authority to the effect that neither the sentence identified in the statistics as the upper end of the range, nor the standard non-parole period, represent the upper limit of the range of sentences open to a sentencing judge. That upper limit is represented by the statutory maximum.  
     
      
    52 The Crown is, of course, correct. But that does not provide an answer to the applicant’s contention. The fact is that, even on the revised statistics (as provided by the Crown) for an offence involving a quantity of the drug very much towards the bottom of the commercial quantity range, the applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment towards the top of the range within which offenders are, as a matter of practice, ordinarily sentenced. And the selection of that sentence cannot be explained by any of the other factors to which the High Court referred in Wong. There were no aggravating circumstances, either specified in s 21A(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, or otherwise; the applicant’s subjective case was extremely favourable, his prospects of rehabilitation held to be “unusually good’, and he had no prior convictions. These circumstances do not suggest any justification for a sentence that might be seen as more appropriate to an offence of supplying the large commercial quantity, for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for life. 
     
      
    53 I have come to the view that the applicant has made good this ground of the application and that, when regard is had to sentencing patterns, and particularly to the quantity of drug involved, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. I would reduce the head sentence and the non-parole period by 6 months. 
     
      
    54 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted; 
       
       
      (2) Appeal allowed, sentence imposed on count 1 quashed; 
       
       
      (3) In lieu thereof, the applicant be sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 16 November 2005 and expire on 15 November 2008, with a balance of term of 2 ½ years to expire on 15 May 2011;. 
       
       
      I would confirm the sentences imposed in respect of counts 2 and 3.

     HEADNOTE 
      
    The respondent, while in detention at Villawood Detention Centre was involved in an incident on 27 September 2004 which gave rise to charges under the Criminal Code 1995 (C’wlth). At the time he was suffering from a major depressive illness but he had recovered by the time the charges came on for hearing. Counsel for the respondent made an application to the magistrate for an order under s 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (NSW) that it would be more appropriate to deal with the respondent under that section “than otherwise in accordance with law”. Section 32 enabled such an order to be made if the defendant had been suffering from a mental illness at the time of the offence, even if he was no longer suffering from that illness at the time of the hearing. Section 20BQ of the Crimes Act (C’wlth) only permitted such an order to be made if the defendant was suffering from a mental illness at the time of the hearing. The magistrate dismissed the application on the ground that s 20BQ of the Crimes Act applied and s 32 of the State Act did not. The respondent’s appeal to the Supreme Court was allowed on the ground that s 32 was picked up as Federal law by s 68(1) of the Judiciary Act. The prosecution applied for leave to appeal, and the Court heard full argument on that application. Held: (1) Leave to appeal should be granted; (2) The question was whether the State section was “applicable” so that s 68(1) of the Judiciary Act made it “apply”; (3) Section 20BQ embodied “a Commonwealth legislative scheme which was complete on its face” and “left no room” for the operation of s 32 of the State Act: Putland v The Queen (2004) 218 CLR 174 per Gleeson CJ at 179-180 applied; (4) The appeal should be allowed. 
     
     ORDERS 
    (1) Leave to appeal granted;(2) Notice of appeal to be filed within 10 days;(3) Appeal allowed;(4) Judgment of the Common Law Division is set aside and in lieu thereof there is substituted an order that the respondent’s appeal to the Common Law Division be dismissed;(5) The respondent is to pay the appellant's costs of the proceedings in this Court, and in the Common Law Division, but is to have a certificate under the Suitors Fund Act in respect of the costs in this Court.

     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons in draft of Handley AJA. I agree with the orders that his Honour proposes. Partially in deference to the careful and helpful arguments of counsel and partially in deference to the position of the respondent charged with a summary offence said to have had a relationship with a major depressive illness related to his incarceration for four years as (then) an unlawful non-citizen under the Migration Act 1958 (Cth), I would prefer to express my reasons in my own words, though I agree generally with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    2 Though the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), ss 68 and 79 are in relevantly different form (“so far as they are applicable”: s 68(1); and “except as otherwise provided”: s 79), “little, if any, functional difference” exists between these two forms of qualification: Putland v The Queen [2004] HCA 8; 218 CLR 174 at 179 [7] (per Gleeson CJ) and 189 [41] (per Gummow and Heydon JJ, with whom Callinan J agreed at 215 [121]).  
     
      
    3 The meaning of “otherwise provided” in s 79 (and so the implicitly identical test in s 68) involves the assessment of the operation of the two statutes in question (assuming that the Constitution, s 109 has not removed the State Act from operation at an antecedent stage: Northern Territory v GPAO [1999] HCA 8; 196 CLR 553 at 576 [38] and 586 [76]; and Agtrack (NT) Pty Limited v Hatfield [2005] HCA 38; 223 CLR 251 at 271 [61]-[63] (per Gleeson CJ and McHugh, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ)), being the Commonwealth law and the State or Territory law picked up by s 68 or s 79, working together as laws of the same polity – the Commonwealth. 
     
      
    4 In GPAO at 587-588 [79]-[80] Gleeson CJ and Gummow J (with whom Gaudron J and Hayne J agreed in this respect: see 606 [135] and 650 [254]) adopted what Mason J had said in University of Wollongong v Metwally [1984] HCA 74; 158 CLR 447 at 463 in explicating the relevant notion of inconsistency involved. There, Mason J said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        Inconsistency or repugnancy is a long-standing concept in the field of statutory law. Where the provisions of two statutes are in conflict, so much so that they cannot be reconciled one with the other, there is a consequential need to resolve the problem created by the conflict. In the case of conflicting statutes enacted by one legislature the problem is resolved by regarding the later statute as impliedly repealing the earlier statute to the extent of the inconsistency. In the case of conflicting statutes, one enacted by the Imperial Parliament, the other by a colonial legislature, the problem was resolved in favour of the primacy of the Imperial statute, even if it be the first in time… 
        
       
      
    5 In Austral Pacific Group Limited (In liquidation) v Airservices Australia [2000] HCA 39; 203 CLR 136 at 144 [17], Gleeson CJ and Gummow and Hayne JJ applied GPAO and further said: 
     
      
       
        
        The question is whether the operation of the Compensation Act would so reduce the ambit of the Contribution Act that the provisions of the Compensation Act are irreconcilable with the other law. If so, the Compensation Act “otherwise provides” within the meaning of s 79 of the  
        Judiciary Act 
        .  
        GPAO 
         shows that the question is not answered by application of the doctrine identified, in the decisions construing s 109 of the Constitution, with the phrase “covering the field”. 
        
       
      
    6 Thus, if the Commonwealth law expressly or by implication makes contrary provision to the putative surrogate federal law (the State law to be picked up) the State law will not be picked up. This can be seen to be inconsistency or repugnancy such that the two laws cannot be reconciled one with the other such that an implied repeal to the extent of the inconsistency would occur: Metwally at 463. Such inconsistency has been described as “actual contrariety”. Putland at 189 [40] where Gummow and Heydon JJ referred to Butler v Attorney-General of Victoria [1961] HCA 32; 106 CLR 268 at 275 and Dossett v TKJ Nominees Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 69; 218 CLR 1 at 7 [14] and 13-14 [43]. 
     
      
    7 Further illumination of the notion of contrariety is given by the clarity of the passage from the reasons of Fullagar J in Butler v Attorney-General (picking up also what Lord Blackburn said in Garnett v Bradley (1878) 3 App Cas 944 at 966), cited by Gummow and Heydon JJ in Putland at 189 [40]. In Butler v Attorney-General Fullagar J said at 275-276: 
     
      
       
        
        The books contain, of course, plenty of examples of an implied repeal – total or partial – of an earlier statute by a later statute of the same legislature. But it is a comparatively rare phenomenon, and it has been said again and again that such a repeal will not be held to have been effected unless actual contrariety is clearly apparent. I would say that it is a very rare thing for one statute in affirmative terms to be found to be impliedly repealed by another which is also in affirmative terms. The classical statement on the subject is, I think, to be found in the opinion of Lord Blackburn in  
        Garnett v. Bradley 
        … . After calling attention to the generally unsatisfactory nature of the authorities, his Lordship said: ""I shall not attempt to recite all the contrarieties which make one statute inconsistent with another; the  
        contraria 
         which make the second statute repeal the first. But there is one rule, a rule of common sense, which is found constantly laid down in these authorities to which I have referred, namely, that when the new enactment is couched in general affirmative language and the previous law, whether a law of custom or not, can well stand with it, for the language used is all in the affirmative, there is nothing to say that the previous law shall be repealed, and therefore the old and the new laws may stand together. There the general affirmative words used in the new law would not of themselves repeal the old. But when the new affirmative words are, as was said in  
        Stradling v. Morgan 
        …, such as by their necessity to import a contradiction, that is to say, where one can see that it must have been intended that the two should be in conflict, the two could not stand together; the second repeals the first"" … . 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        It should be pointed out in this connexion that the position where contrariety is suggested between an earlier and a later State statute is not quite the same as the position where inconsistency, within the meaning of s. 109, is suggested between a Commonwealth Act and a State Act. The Commonwealth Parliament is, within its sphere of power, a paramount legislature, and there can be no presumption either that it did, or that it did not, intend by its own Act to supersede or preclude from operation a State Act. But, where the comparison to be made is between two State Acts, there is a very strong presumption that the State legislature did not intend to contradict itself, but intended that both Acts should operate. It will often be found that the two may reasonably and properly be reconciled by reading the one as subject to the other. In other words it will commonly be found that the appropriate maxim is not  
        leges posteriores priores contrarias abrogant 
         but  
        generalia specialibus non derogant 
        . 
         
        (Footnotes omitted.) 
        
       
      
    8 The clarity required for such contrariety and the rarity of implied repeal, reflected upon by Fullagar J in Butler v A-G were referred to in Dossett v TKJ Nominees Pty Limited [2003] HCA 69; 218 CLR 1 at 7 [14] (per McHugh J) and at 13-14 (per Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ). As was pointed out in Dossett at 14 [43], the passage of Fullagar J in Butler v Attorney-General at 275 has been applied on a number of occasions by the High Court: South Australia v Tanner [1989] HCA 3; 166 CLR 161 at 171 (per Wilson, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ); Saraswati v The Queen [1991] HCA 21; 172 CLR 1 at 17 (per Gaudron J); Kartinyeri v Commonwealth [1998] HCA 52; 195 CLR 337 at 375 (per Gummow and Hayne JJ); and Shergold v Tanner [2002] HCA 19; 209 CLR 126 at 136-137 (per Gleeson CJ and McHugh, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ, citing Gaudron J in Saraswati at 17).9 This notion of contrariety encompasses not only the circumstance where “a Commonwealth law expressly or by implication made a contrary provision” to the State law to be picked up – the putative surrogate federal law (see Putland at 179 [7], per Gleeson CJ), but also where “there [was] a Commonwealth legislative scheme relating to the [relevant subject matter] which was ‘complete upon its face’ and can ‘be seen to have left no room’ for the operation of [the section to be picked up]”: Putland at 179-180 [7], per Gleeson CJ. 
     
      
    10 To put the matter in the relevant statutory context here, would picking up the State law (the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (NSW), s 32) derogate from and effectively impliedly repeal all or any part of the Commonwealth law (the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 20BQ) or is the Crimes Act, s 20BQ complete upon its face leaving no room for operation of the law to be picked-up? 
     
      
    11 These two ways of putting the matter can be seen to be intimately related. If the Commonwealth law is complete upon its face leaving no room for the operation of a surrogate federal law, that is so because part of the content of the existing Commonwealth law is a negation of additional statutory content on the subject. If a State law to be picked up as surrogate federal law would add statutory content to the subject, there would be an implied repeal of the negation of additional content present within the Commonwealth Act. 
     
      
    12 Handley AJA refers to the canon of statutory construction (the maxim expressum facit cessare tacitum) that if there be a power given by a particular provision which prescribes the mode by which it shall be exercised and the conditions and restrictions which must be observed in its exercise, the operation of general powers in the same statute will be excluded: see R v Wallis [1949] HCA 30; 78 CLR 529 at 550; Leon Fink Holdings Pty Limited v Australian Film Commission [1979] HCA 26; 141 CLR 672 at 678; Downey v Trans Waste Pty Limited [1991] HCA 11; 172 CLR 167 at 171-172; and Australasian Memory Pty Limited v Brien [2000] HCA 30; 200 CLR 270 at 280-281 [21]. 
     
      
    13 The maxim expressum facit cessare tacitum can be seen as an aspect of the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterus: see Pearce DC and Geddes RS Statutory Interpretation in Australia (LexisNexis/Butterworths) 5th Ed at 142 [4.30] citing Attorney-General (NSW); Ex rel Franklins Stores Pty Limited v Lizelle Pty Limited [1977] 2 NSWLR 955 at 962 and Plunkett v Smith (1911) 14 CLR 76. 
     
      
    14 To the extent that this equation of the two is legitimate, caution is required to be exercised in their application: Australian Securities and Investments Commission v DB Management Pty Limited [2000] HCA 7; 199 CLR 321 at 340 [42] and the cases there cited; Pearce and Geddes op cit at 140-142. The requirement for caution in the use of the maxim expressum facit cessare tacitum was stated by the Court in Balog v ICAC [1990] HCA 28; 169 CLR 625 at 632 and Ainsworth v Criminal Justice Commission [1992] HCA 10; 175 CLR 564 at 575. 
     
      
    15 That said, Professors Pearce and Geddes in their work point out, at 142-143 [4.30]-[4.31], that the use of the expressum facit maxim has been more enthusiastically embraced in giving effect to the dictum of Dixon J in R v Wallis and to the similar statement by Gavan Duffy CJ and Dixon J in Anthony Hordern and Sons Ltd v The Amalgamated Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia [1932] HCA 9; 47 CLR 1 at 7 where the following was said: 
     
      
       
        
        When the Legislature explicitly gives a power by a particular provision which prescribes the mode in which it shall be exercised and the conditions and restrictions which must be observed, it excludes the operation of general expressions in the same instrument which might otherwise have been relied upon for the same power. 
        
       
      
    16 The cases to which Professors Pearce and Geddes refer at p 143 of their work reinforce the authorities to which Handley AJA has referred: see in particular, David Grant & Co Pty Limited v Westpac Banking Corporation [1995] HCA 43; 184 CLR 265 at 276 (per Gummow J, with whom Brennan CJ and Dawson, Gaudron and McHugh JJ agreed). 
     
      
    17 The operation of the maxim is readily understandable in the context in the case of construing specific and general provisions in the one Act. It is not entirely clear how the maxim operates in respect of two Acts passed by the same Parliament each of which deals in a particular way with the relevant subject matter: see the comments of the Full Court of the Federal Court (Black CJ and Cooper and Merkel JJ) in Re Wilcox; Ex parte Venture Industries Pty Limited (1996) 66 FCR 511 at 530-531. 
     
      
    18 The task here is not the resolution of the extent of operation of a specific and a general provision in one Act. Rather, it is to assess whether picking up a State law as a Commonwealth law would be contrary to an existing Commonwealth law, either because it would be contrary to it in a way that could be seen to effectively repeal it or derogate from it, or because it would be contrary to or derogate from an express or implied complete regime on the relevant subject constituted by the existing Commonwealth law. The negative to be found in the latter case is one to the effect that the provision is, or is part of, a scheme complete upon its face, and to introduce the surrogate federal law would derogate from the intended exclusivity or completeness of the existing Commonwealth law. 
     
      
    19 The maxim assists in this enquiry, but ultimately the resolution of this question is determined not merely by the application of the maxim, but by the process of statutory interpretation of the intended content of the Crimes Act, s 20BQ. 
     
      
    20 The context of the introduction of s 20BQ was that there were provisions to similar effect in New South Wales (the Crimes Act 1990 (NSW), ss 428W and 428X). Queensland’s provision dealt only with detaining persons in hospital: Mental Health Services Act 1974 (Qld), s 29A. 
     
      
    21 The Australian Law Reform Commission Report on Sentencing (Report No 44, 1988) dealt with the subject. A discussion of mentally ill and intellectually disabled offenders is found at pp 109-119 of the Report. There was a recognition of the inadequacy of legal approach to the issue up to that time. This led the Commission to say the following at [200] of the Report: 
     
      
       
        
        The Commission recommends that a reference covering all issues concerning the mentally ill and the intellectually disabled in the criminal justice system should be given to it. Full-scale reforms for mentally ill or intellectually disabled Australian Capital Territory and federal offenders will undoubtedly take some years to develop and implement. Because the position of these offenders has been ignored for nearly a century, the following recommendations have been made to allow them access to some of the advantages of recent innovations in this area. These recommendations should, however, be seen as only a stop-gap measure, until comprehensive reforms are implemented. 
        
       
      
    22 No relevant draft legislation was provided by the Commission in its report. However, in the report, there was discussion under the heading “New Sentencing Options” of “hospital orders”, “psychiatric probation orders” and “guardianship orders” (the first two of which can be seen in the Crimes Act, Division 9, ss 20BS – 20BY). There was no discussion of the type of provision in s 20BQ or the pre-existing New South Wales provisions: Crimes Act 1900, ss 428W and 428X. 
     
      
    23 As Gummow and Heydon JJ said in Putland at 193 [52], the Explanatory Memorandum to the Crimes Legislation Amendment Bill (No 2) 1989 (Cth) expressed various objectives in amending the Commonwealth Crimes Act, varying between the making of exhaustive provisions on some subjects and supplementary provision on others. The example of the former given by their Honours was taken from the Outline of the Explanatory Memorandum concerning non-parole periods: 
     
      
       
        
        3. to provide a separate regime for fixing federal non-parole periods rather than relying on applied State or Territory legislation; 
        
       
      
    24 In the same Outline the following appeared in [7]-[9] about the mentally ill or disabled: 
     
      
       
        
        7. to establish new procedures for federal offenders charged on indictment with a federal offence and who are found unfit to plead or unfit to be tried or not guilty on the grounds of mental illness; 
        
       
       
        
        8. to provide new procedures for magistrates courts when dealing summarily with federal matters where the defendant is mentally ill or intellectually disabled; 
        
       
       
        
        9. to provide the additional sentencing options of hospital orders, psychiatric probation orders (for mentally ill offenders) and program probation orders (for intellectually disabled offenders); 
        
       
      
    25 The expression “separate regime” is not used in relation to magistrates dealing summarily with the mentally ill in [7] of the outline above, but the “new provisions” on their face were an apparently complete regime for the approach by magistrates to the subject matter of diversion. The requirement for the present existence of the mental illness or disability (“is suffering from”) in s 20BQ can be seen to give effect to an aspect of the safeguards in such reforms: see the discussion in the Report at [209] and [213]. 
     
      
    26 Prior to the introduction of s 20BQ, in New South Wales, the Crimes Act (NSW), s 428W or s 428X would have been picked up (depending upon whether the defendant was mentally ill within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1958 (NSW)). These provisions provided as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Persons suffering from mental illness or condition 
        
       
       
        
        428W (1) 
         Where, at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a magistrate, it appears to the magistrate: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) that the defendant is developmentally disabled, is suffering from a mental illness or is suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital, but is not a mentally ill person within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1958; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b)  
        that, on an outline of the facts alleged in the proceedings or such other evidence as the magistrate may consider relevant, it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this Chapter than otherwise in accordance with law, 
        
       
       
        
        the magistrate: 
        
       
       
        
        (c) may dismiss the charge and discharge the defendant: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) into the care of a responsible person, unconditionally or subject to conditions; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) upon the condition that the defendant attend upon a person or at a place specified by the magistrate for assessment of the defendant’s mental condition or treatment, or both; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (iii) unconditionally; or 
        
       
       
        
        (d) may do any more or more of the following: 
        
       
       
        
         (i) adjourn the proceedings; 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) grant the defendant bail in accordance with the Bail Act 1978; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) make any other order that the magistrate considers appropriate. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) A decision under subsection (1)(c) to dismiss charges against a defendant does not constitute a finding that the charges against the defendant are proven or otherwise. 
        
       
       
        
        Mentally ill persons 
        
       
       
        
        428X (1) 
         Where, at the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a magistrate, it appears to the magistrate that the defendant is a mentally ill person within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1958, the magistrate (without derogating from any other order the magistrate may make in relation to the defendant, whether by way of adjournment, the granting of bail in accordance with the Bail Act 1978 or otherwise): 
        
       
       
        
        (a) may order that the person be taken by a member of the Police Force to, and be detained in, an admission centre within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1958 to be examined and dealt with under that Act as if the person were a person admitted to and detained in an admission centre under section 12(1) of that Act; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) may discharge the defendant, unconditionally or subject to conditions, into the care of a responsible person. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) Where a defendant is dealt with the commencement or at any time during the course of the hearing of proceedings before a magistrate in accordance with subsection (1), the charge which gave rise to the proceedings shall, on the expiration of the period of 6 months after the date on which the defendant is so dealt with, be deemed to have been dismissed unless, within that period, the defendant is brought before a magistrate to be further dealt with in relation to the charge. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Where a defendant is brought before a magistrate to be further dealt with in relation to a charge as referred to in subsection (2), the magistrate shall, in dealing with the charge, take account of any period during which the defendant was in an admission centre, a mental hospital or an authorised hospital within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1958 as a consequence of an order made under subsection (1)(a). 
        
       
       
        
        (4) A deemed dismissal of charges under subsection (2) does not constitute a finding that the charges against the defendant are proven or otherwise. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
    27 The terms of s 20BQ comprised on their face an intended regime of treatment in summary jurisdiction of the mentally ill. The terms of s 20BQ do not easily admit of a construction that they are intended to be supplemented or complemented by additional or differently worded provisions on the very same subject, such as ss 428W and 428X and now the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, ss 32 and 33. 
     
      
    28 In Putland, the narrow terms of the Commonwealth provision (the Crimes Act, s 4K(3) and (4)) were easily understood against the history of the legislation and told against any implication of a negative: Putland at 182 [14]. Here, the introduction of Division 8 (ss 20BQ and 20BR) can be seen to be a self-contained coherent regime for the diversion of persons charged in the summary jurisdiction by reference to mental illness. 
     
      
    29 If s 20BQ is not to be regarded as the only regime to deal with the subject of diversion from the criminal justice system by reference to mental illness, an effect will be brought about of the overlaying of similar, but differently expressed, regimes, involving (as here) different underlying policies. An examination of the terms of s 20BQ providing nominated conditions of application (involving policy considerations) and nominated responses, in the absence of which the criminal justice system will operate leads to the conclusion, in my view, that Division 8 was intended to be an exhaustive statement of the Commonwealth Parliament’s response to the issue dealt with, and thus for the purposes of the Judiciary Act, ss 68 and 79 a scheme complete upon its face leaving no room for the operation of the cognate State provision in the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, s 32 (and s 33) to be picked up as federal law. 
     
      
    30 For the avoidance of doubt I should add one matter which arose in debate. The mental illness spoken of in s 20BQ relates, as I would read the provision, to any underlying condition and someone would not cease to be mentally ill because of a stable regime of medication. 
     
      
    31 IPP JA: I agree with Allsop P and Handley AJA. 
     
      
    32 HANDLEY AJA: This is an application for leave to appeal from a decision of Rothman J who allowed an appeal by the respondent from an order of Huber LCM who dismissed his application under s 32 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (the State Act), operating as Federal law under s 68(1) of the Judiciary Act, for an order that it would be more appropriate to deal with him under that section ""than otherwise in accordance with law."" The Magistrate held that the provisions of s 20BQ of the Crimes Act 1914 (the Federal Act) applied and s 32 did not. 
     
      
    33 The case was listed for full argument on the basis that the Court would be in a position to finally dispose of the matter if it granted leave to appeal. 
     
      
    34 The respondent, an Iranian citizen, alleges that he converted from Islam to Christianity and came to Australia because he feared persecution. He was detained at Villawood Detention Centre between 2000 and 2004. On 27 September 2004 an incident occurred at the Centre which gave rise to charges under the Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) that he threatened to harrass, caused harm to, and obstructed a Commonwealth official. 
     
      
    35 It was common ground that the respondent was suffering from a major depressive illness at the time of the alleged offences but was not at the time of the hearing before the Magistrate. 
     
      
    36 Section 32(1) (the State section) applies to ""proceedings before a Magistrate"" where the defendant ""is (or was at the time of the alleged commission of the offence … )"" relevantly for this case ""(ii) suffering from mental illness; or (iii) suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital, but is not a mentally ill person within the meaning of Chapter 3 of the Mental Health Act 1990."" 
     
      
    37 If the Magistrate finds (para (b)) that ""it would be more appropriate to deal with the defendant in accordance with the provisions of this part than otherwise in accordance with law"" he may make various orders which include adjourning the proceedings, granting bail, dismissing the charge and discharging the defendant either into the care of a responsible person subject to conditions or otherwise, or on condition requiring him to report for assessment of his mental condition, or for treatment or both, or unconditionally. 
     
      
    38 The corresponding section in the Federal Act is s 20BQ (the Federal section) and there is a substantial degree of overlap between the two sections. There are differences, only some of which are directly relevant. The principal difference which has led to these proceedings is that the Federal section only applies relevantly where the person charged ""is suffering from a mental illness"" whereas the State section also applies where the defendant ""was"" suffering from such an illness ""at the time of the alleged commission of the offence"". It is not necessary to explore the other differences. 
     
      
    39 Critically for present purposes s 20BQ(1)(b) provides that a Federal offender who is suffering from a mental illness etc may be dealt with under the section, instead of “otherwise in accordance with law.” 
     
      
    40 If the State section applied as Federal law it was open to the Magistrate to find that it was more appropriate to deal with the respondent under Part 3 of the State Act, ""than otherwise in accordance with law"". However if only the Federal section applied it was not open to the Magistrate to make such a finding. 
     
      
    41 The case does not raise any question of inconsistency under s 109 of the Commonwealth Constitution because the State section could only apply if it was Federal law picked up by s 68 of the Judiciary Act. Section 68(1), & (2) relevantly provide: 
     
      
       
        
        ""(1) The laws of a State or Territory respecting the arrest and custody of offenders or persons charged with offences, and the procedure for: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) their summary conviction; and 
           
          (b) … 
           
          (c) … 
           
          (d) …; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        and for holding accused persons to bail, shall, subject to this section, apply and be applied so far as they are applicable to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth in respect of whom jurisdiction is conferred on the several Courts of that State or Territory by this section. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The several Courts of a State or Territory exercising jurisdiction with respect to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the summary conviction; or 
           
          (b) … 
           
          (c) …  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        of offenders or persons charged with offences against the laws of a State or Territory … shall, subject to this section … have the like jurisdiction with respect to persons who are charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth ….”. 
        
       
      
    42 The question for determination therefore is whether the State section was “applicable” so that s 68(1) made it ""apply"" to the hearing of these charges or whether the Federal section made the State section inapplicable. 
     
      
    43 If s 68(1)(a) made the State section applicable it applied as surrogate Federal law: Northern Territory v GPAO (1999) 196 CLR 553, 588. The test to determine whether s 32 applies is whether it is applicable and capable of being applied having regard to the prescription in the Federal section. In Putland v The Queen (2004) 218 CLR 174, 179-180 Gleeson CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The laws of a State or Territory to which s 68(1) refers apply ‘so far as they are applicable’. Although there is not in s 68, as there is in s 79 of the  
        Judiciary Act 
        , an express qualification to the operation of the provision by the use of the word ‘except as otherwise provided by the Constitution or the law of the Commonwealth’, in the context of a problem such as the present there is little, if any, functional difference between the two forms of qualification. … Relevantly for present purposes, s 52 of the Sentencing Act would not be picked up and applied by s 68 if a Commonwealth law expressly or by implication made contrary provision, or if there were a Commonwealth legislative scheme relating to the sentencing of the appellant which was ‘complete upon its face’ and can ‘be seen to have left no room’ for the operation of s 52.” 
        
       
      
    44 In the same case Gummow and Heydon JJ said at 188: 
     
      
       
        
        “It appeared to be accepted by the parties in this Court that s 68(1) was to be read in a sense it would have if, as a matter of express statement rather than an implication, there was a qualification for provision otherwise made from time to time by the laws of the Commonwealth. That understanding should be accepted. 
        
       
      
    45 But for ss 68 and 79 of the Judiciary Act State law could not prevent Federal offences being tried according to law. Section 68, by picking up State and Territorial laws with respect to the procedures for summary conviction, would make the State section applicable if there was no Federal section dealing with the same topic. 
     
      
    46 The applicability of the State section, operating as Federal law under s 68, depends on the principles which determine whether a later law of the same Legislature has repealed an earlier one. Similar principles apply when general and special provisions in the same statute have to be reconciled. In a case of the latter kind, R v Wallis [1949] HCA 30; 78 CLR 529, Dixon J said at 549-550: 
     
      
       
        
        “Upon matters with reference to which the Act does not elsewhere specify or indicate what may or shall be done by an award or order, this general power is properly interpreted as enabling the arbitrator to make any provision he thinks fit that is relevant, appropriate or reasonably incidental to the settlement of the real dispute before him. 
        
       
       
        
        But upon some matters the Act does speak with more particularity. If it confers a specific power with respect to a limited subject or specifies a manner of dealing with it or otherwise provides what the duty or authority of the arbitrator shall be, then upon ordinary principles of interpretation the provision in which that is done should be treated as the source of his authority over the matter, notwithstanding that otherwise the same or a wider power over the same matter might have been implied in or covered by the general authority given by s 38. This accords with the general principles of interpretation embodied in the maxim  
        expressum facit cessare tacitum 
         and in the proposition that an enactment in affirmative words appointing a course to be followed usually may be understood as importing a negative, namely, that the same matter is not to be done according to some other course. 
        
       
       
        
        This applies especially when the power or duty affirmatively conferred or imposed is qualified by some condition, limitation or direction. In  
        North Stafford Steel Iron & Coal Co. (Burslem), Ltd v Ward 
         (1868) LR 3 Ex 172, 177 Willes J refers to ‘the ordinary rule, that if authority is given expressly, though by affirmative words, upon a defined condition, the expression of that condition excludes the doing of the act authorised under other circumstances than those defined’.” 
        
       
      
    47 These principles have frequently been applied: Leon Fink Holdings Pty Ltd v Australian Film Commission [1979] HCA 26; 141 CLR 672; Saraswati v R [1991] HCA 21; 172 CLR 1; Downey v Trans Waste Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 11; 172 CLR 167; and Australasian Memory Pty Ltd v Brien (2000) 200 CLR 270, 280. 
     
      
    48 In my opinion these principles should determine the result in this case. The Federal section appoints in affirmative words the course to be followed in deciding whether a summary prosecution is to be determined otherwise than by trial in accordance with law. The power to determine “otherwise” is qualified by an express condition that the person charged ""is suffering from"" a mental illness or an intellectual disability. The authority of the Magistrate to exercise the powers in the Federal section is given by affirmative words, but its expression excludes the exercise of the powers under other circumstances.  
     
      
    49 The Federal section should be understood as providing that, unless it applies, offenders charged with Federal offences shall be dealt with otherwise, that is according to law. The negative is inherent in the choice between disposing of the case by exercising the powers conferred by the Federal section or by disposing of it ""otherwise in accordance with law"". 
     
      
    50 The Federal section was added by the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 1989. At that time analogous provisions existed in the law of New South Wales and Queensland, but not in the other States and Territories. 
     
      
    51 Section 428W of the Crimes Act (NSW) which was in force when the Federal section was enacted was similar in terms to the Federal section. It applied where (subs (1)(a)) the defendant ""is developmentally disabled, is suffering from a mental illness or is suffering from a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital"". Section 32 of the State Act in its original form enacted in 1990 was in substantially the same terms. At that time the State section did not apply where the defendant was suffering from mental illness etc “at the time of the alleged commission of the offence"", but not at the date of hearing.  
     
      
    52 Section 32 was amended to apply to persons who had the relevant conditions at the time of the offence, but not at the time of the hearing, by the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Amendment Act 2005 NSW (No. 109) Sch 1 cl [17]. 
     
      
    53 In 1989 specific provisions in Queensland which applied in summary proceedings were limited to persons whose condition warranted their detention in a hospital. 
     
      
    54 The legislative history supports the view that the Federal section is applicable in the present case, and the State section is not.  
     
      
    55 When s 32 of the State Act was extended in 2005 to cases where the defendant was suffering from a mental illness etc at the time of the alleged offence, but not at the time of the hearing, s 20BQ, in the words of Gleeson CJ in Putland, quoted above para [12], made “contrary provision”, and had enacted “a legislative scheme which was complete on its face.” In the words of Gummow and Heydon JJ in the same case: para [13] (above) “provision was otherwise made” by s 20BQ. It follows that, s 32 as extended in 2005 was not “applicable to persons … charged with offences against the laws of the Commonwealth.” 
     
      
    56 In my judgment the appeal succeeds and the following orders should be made: 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal granted; 
       
      (2) Notice of appeal to be filed within 10 days; 
       
      (3) Appeal allowed; 
       
      (4) Judgment of the Common Law Division is set aside and in lieu thereof there is substituted an order that the respondent’s appeal to the Common Law Division be dismissed; 
       
      (5) The respondent is to pay the appellant's costs of the proceedings in this Court, and in the Common Law Division, but is to have a certificate under the  
      Suitors Fund Act  
      in respect of the costs in this Court.

      Facts 
       
       
      Section 10 of the  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act  
      1990 (NSW) (the Act) invests in the Supreme Court the power to issue an order that no person is to dispose of or attempt to dispose of, or to otherwise deal with or attempt to otherwise deal with, an interest in property to which the order applies except in such manner or in such circumstances as are specified in the order.  
       
       
      The New South Wales Crime Commission (the Commission) may apply to the Court, ex parte, for a restraining order if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer within the meaning of s 4 of the Act, deposing to that officer’s suspicion that the property is serious crime derived property within the meaning of s 9 of the Act. The Court must make the order if it considers that having regard to the matters contained in the affidavit there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion. 
       
       
      In the proceedings below the Commission made such an application in respect of interests in property held in 48 New Zealand bank accounts, one Australian bank account and two share trading accounts. The application was supported by the affidavit of an authorised officer, Mr Arthur Moerman, which alleged that the property was the proceeds of a tax avoidance scheme intended to evade Australian company and income tax. The promoter of the scheme was said to be Mr Robert Agius of accounting firm PKF Vanuatu. 
       
       
      After hearing the application ex parte, the primary judge issued an order restraining any attempts to dispose of or otherwise deal with the property in the subject accounts. After the making of that order and subsequent related orders, the appellants acknowledged that they were entitled to exercise effective control over the property in the accounts identified in the orders and applied to be joined to the proceedings. 
       
       
      The appellants challenged the making of the orders on the bases that s 10 of the Act was constitutionally invalid; that various paragraphs of Mr Moerman’s affidavit were improperly admitted; that the primary judge erred in concluding that there were reasonable grounds for the relevant suspicion; that the primary judge was required to give reasons for the issuing of the orders but failed to do so; that the primary judge erred in entertaining proceedings which, at least initially, were without an identified defendant and in entertaining proceedings in the absence of compliance with Schedule J of the Supreme Court Rules. 
       
       
      Held 
       
       
      As to the Constitutional validity of the Act: 
       
       
      McClellan CJ at CL (Allsop P and Beazley JA agreeing) – 
       
       
      Section 10 of the Act does not invest the Supreme Court with a power repugnant to or incompatible with its exercise of Federal judicial power as a court invested with Federal jurisdiction under Ch III of the  
      Commonwealth Constitution 
      . Given the nature of the Commission’s function it is essential it be able to make an ex parte application. Once such an application is made, s 10 raises a justiciable issue in which the Court has an evaluative and determinative role. The Court is required to make a judgement before a restraining order can be issued and is not bound to “rubber stamp” the application of the Commission: [2] (subject to [52]), [56], [100] and [101].

      As to whether certain parts of the affidavit should have been excluded in accordance with the rules of evidence: 
       
       
      Allsop P (Beazley JA agreeing) – 
       
       
      Parliament has made clear that applications under s 10 of the Act are to be governed by the rules of evidence applicable in civil proceedings. Given the application is interlocutory in nature (see point 3 below), the appropriate manner of giving evidence in the proceedings was to identify the source of the evidence and state a belief in its truth. The paragraphs complained of by the appellants contained mere assertions of fact, without identifying the source of the information and should therefore have been rejected by the primary judge [30]-[33] and [56].

      McClellan CJ at CL dissenting – 
       
       
      The affidavit deposed to by Mr Moerman refers to a joint task force investigation between the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Taxation Office. Whilst Mr Moerman does not expressly indicate that he was a member of the joint task force, it can be inferred that he was either a member of it or that the information and conclusions to which he deposed are derived from the information gathered by the joint task force investigation. The issue for the Court under s 10 therefore becomes whether, having regard to the matters deposed to the Court can be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion: [107] and [120]. 
       
       
      As to the nature of the application under s 10: 
       
       
      Allsop P (Beazley JA agreeing) and McClellan CJ at CL –  
       
       
      The application is interlocutory in character, being ancillary to forfeiture and proceeds assessment proceedings at which final rights between the parties will be determined in substantive orders: [4], [56] and [76].

      As to reasonable grounds for suspicion:  
       
       
      Allsop P (Beazley JA agreeing) – 
       
       
      There was no admissible evidence before the primary judge on which he could conclude that any of the suspicions held by Mr Moerman were based on reasonable grounds [22]-[24], [39] (subject to [51]) and [56].  
       
       
      McClellan CJ at CL dissenting –  
       
       
      The matters that Mr Moerman deposed to, in particular the activities of Mr Agius, justify his suspicion that the property in the bank accounts identified in the orders, over which the respondents exercise effective control, was serious crime derived property: [120], [132]-[135].

      As to the failure of the primary judge to give reasons: 
       
       
      Allsop P (Beazley JA agreeing) – 
       
       
      The subject matter of the Act, the nature of the application under s 10, the consequences for the person the subject of a successful ex parte 
        
      application by the Commission, the existence of the supervisory appeal and the character of the assessment to be made by the primary judge all point to, or are consistent with, the obligation that the Court provide reasons; although such reasons need not be elaborate: [41], [47], [50] and [56].

      McClellan CJ at CL dissenting – 
       
       
      The cases establish that the content of the duty to give reasons will vary depending upon the circumstances and nature of the case and that there will be cases in which reasons are not required. This was such a case. Section 10 required the primary judge to make only one decision which was amenable to one of two answers. The parties would have been aware of the matters which effected the decision of the primary judge and there is no difficulty for an appellate court in reviewing that decision: [141].

      As to entertaining proceedings without an identified defendant: 
       
       
      McClellan CJ at CL (Allsop P and Beazley JA agreeing) – 
       
       
      Rule 6.1A of the  
      Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 
       lists various types of proceedings which may be commenced without a defendant. However, it does not otherwise prohibit proceedings where a defendant is not named. Proceedings under the Act are not referred to by the Rule. Nor was the failure to name individual defendants an abuse of process. The orders of the primary judge operated in rem and in any event the appellants subsequently applied to be joined as defendants to the proceedings: [3], [56] and [143]. 
       
       
      As to the applicability of Schedule J of the  
      Supreme Court Rules 
      : 
       
       
      McClellan CJ at CL (Allsop P and Beazley JA agreeing) – 
       
       
      A statement as contemplated by Schedule J would not add to an understanding of the nature of the application and, being a rule of procedure, compliance may be dispensed with by the Court: [3], [56] and [145].

     INTERNATIONAL FINANCE TRUST COMPANY LIMITED & ANOR v NEW SOUTH WALES CRIME COMMISSION & ORS 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: I have had the considerable advantage of reading the reasons of the Chief Judge at Common Law. I have the misfortune to disagree with his Honour in two respects which means that I cannot agree with the orders that he proposes. I would allow the appeal and set aside some of the orders made by the primary judge. His Honour’s comprehensive reasons permit me to direct myself to matters of substance without the need to explain the background to the application and to the appeal. 
     
      
    2 I agree with McClellan CJ at CL’s views as to the Kable point. In particular, I agree with his Honour’s comments about the Commission’s entitlement to have an ex parte hearing, should it choose to move in that manner. Nothing said by Giles JA (with whom Mason P agreed) in New South Wales Crime Commission v Ollis [2006] NSWCA 76; 65 NSWLR 478, especially at 486 [32] is to the contrary. Giles JA’s reference there to an inter partes application was not a conclusion that the Court had authority to deny to the Commission that which Parliament clearly gave it – the ability under s 10(2) and (2AA) to apply to the Court ex parte and, implicitly, to have the application dealt with on the basis of the application as made. 
     
      
    3 I agree with McClellan CJ at CL as to UCPR 6.1A and the Supreme Court Rules, Schedule J. 
     
      
    4 I agree that the application under s 10 is interlocutory in character. The Court in Hadjigeorgiou v New South Wales Crime Commission [2007] NSWCA 197; 174 A Crim R 124 treated the matter as interlocutory in character. The Full Court of the Federal Court in Director of Public Prosecutions (ACT) v Hiep (1998) 86 FCR 33 at 48-50 concluded that the restraining order under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1991 (ACT) was interlocutory. It is unnecessary to compare in detail that Act with the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (the “Act”). It is sufficient to say that the considerations there discussed are substantially applicable here: the interim effect of the order as ancillary to forfeiture and proceeds assessment orders, the lack of final determination of rights between the parties in the way that such rights will be determined by the resolution of the substantive orders for forfeiture or proceeds assessment, and the proper characterisation of the restraining order under the Act as not a “principal cause” for the purposes of Hall v Nominal Defendant (1966) 117 CLR 423 at 443. 
     
      
    5 The status of the evidence that was led before the primary judge is more problematic. Before examining the evidence, some further comments about the Act should be made. The purposes and objects of the Act can be derived from the long title to the Act, the statement of principal objects in s 3 and the Second Reading Speech. 
     
      
    6 On 8 May 1990, the then Premier (the Hon Nick Greiner) made clear in the Second Reading Speech to the Drug Trafficking (Civil Proceedings) Bill, the important public policy to which the Act was directed: depriving those involved in crime of illicit gains. This important public policy is an aspect of significance for the protection and well-being of any civil society. 
     
      
    7 Balanced against that important public policy is the clear recognition in our legal and political system of the importance of the protection of individual rights, including the right to own and enjoy private property. Thus, the common law requires a degree of clarity in the wording of any statute which abrogates or confiscates property rights. This is rooted in the importance of such rights and their legitimate protection in civil society free from the exercise of arbitrary power, in particular prerogative or Executive power. As to the approach to the Act, see generally New South Wales Crime Commission v Kelaita [2008] NSWCA 284 at [6]-[17]. 
     
      
    8 The Act seeks to accommodate the tension between those two underlying policies in a number of ways. First, the orders under ss 10, 22 and 27 are made by the Court. There was no proposition put on appeal that the task in s 10 was other than judicial. (See generally, in this respect, Basten JA in Hadjigeorgiou at 134-138 [48]-[62].) The extent of the justiciable determination under each of ss 10, 22 and 27 varies. In s 10, the extent of that determination is narrow, but real. 
     
      
    9 Secondly, the Parliament has made clear that the application in s 10 (along with other applications, and although ex parte) is to be governed by the rules of evidence applicable in civil proceedings: the Act, s 5(2)(b). Since an application under s 10 is interlocutory in character, the “rules of evidence” are those which are applicable in interlocutory proceedings. The Evidence Act 1995 (NSW) is a statement of the rules of evidence in New South Wales State courts: see Chapter 1, Preliminary to the Evidence Act. The Evidence Act by s 4(1)(b) and (c) applies to interlocutory proceedings or proceedings of a similar kind and proceedings heard in chambers. The application under s 10 is a proceeding given that it is made to the Court for the exercise of judicial power. Therefore, the Evidence Act, as it applies to interlocutory proceedings, is applicable. 
     
      
    10 These two important features of the Act reflect the mechanism (the use of the judicial branch of government) that Parliament has chosen to mediate the relationship between the competing, and to a degree conflicting, policies to which I have referred. 
     
      
    11 As to the requirement to comply with the rules of evidence, this applies to an ex parte application under s 10 as much as it does to a contested application under s 22 or s 27. This places important responsibilities upon both the Commission and the Judge hearing the application under s 10. Being an ex parte application, the Commission might be seen to be subject to obligations of disclosure: Garrard v Email Furniture Pty Limited (1993) 32 NSWLR 662 at 676-677; Thomas A Edison Ltd v Bullock (1912) 15 CLR 679 at 681-682. The position of the Crown in litigation (P & C Cantarella Pty Limited v Egg Marketing Board (NSW) [1973] 2 NSWLR 366 at 383-384) might be seen to reinforce that. It should be recognised, however, that the subject matter for judicial assessment is narrow: the reasonableness of the suspicion, from the affidavit. Further, there is no discretion in the Court if it is satisfied of the reasonableness of the suspicion. Those considerations may affect the question of the existence of any duty, and if it exists, its extent. The question should be seen as one of statutory construction, at least in the first instance: Lego Australia Pty Limited v Paraggio (1994) 53 FCR 542; and compare The ‘Varna’ [1993] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 253 at 257; Haji-Ioannou v Frangos [1999] 2 Lloyd’s Rep 337 at 353; and The ‘Harima’ [1987] HKLR 770 at 774. This question was not the subject of argument and is unnecessary to discuss further or decide. These considerations do, however, illuminate the different character of an application under s 10 from an ordinary ex parte civil application, which is a matter of particular relevance to the later discussion about the need for reasons. Given, however, that there is no contested hearing after any ex parte order (New South Wales Crime Commission v Ollis [2006] NSWCA 76; 65 NSWLR 478) and given that the Judge must make an assessment of the reasonableness of any suspicion by reference to the affidavit, the Judge (and the Commission) will need to be astute to ensure that Parliament’s requirement, that the rules of evidence apply, is followed. If they are not, there will, or may, be appellable error. 
     
      
    12 Given the interlocutory nature of the proceeding under s 10, the Evidence Act, s 9 is of particular relevance: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) This Act does not affect the operation of a principle or rule of common law or equity in relation to evidence in a proceeding to which this Act applies, except so far as this Act provides otherwise expressly or by necessary intendment. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) Without limiting subsection (1), this Act does not affect the operation of such a principle or rule so far as it relates to any of the following:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) admission or use of evidence of reasons for a decision of a member of a jury, or of the deliberations of a member of a jury in relation to such a decision, in a proceeding by way of appeal from a judgment, decree, order or sentence of a court, 
          
         
        
       
      
      
     
      
       
        
         (b) the operation of a legal or evidential presumption that is not inconsistent with this Act, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) a court’s power to dispense with the operation of a rule of evidence or procedure in an interlocutory proceeding. 
          
         
        
       
      
    13 Section 9 does not create an independent statutory basis for dispensing with the operation of the rules of evidence. Rather, it recognises, so as not to affect, any rule of common law or in equity in relation to evidence in a proceeding insofar as it relates to the Court’s power to dispense with the operation of a rule of evidence in an interlocutory proceeding. In Geoffrey W Hill & Associates v King (1992) 27 NSWLR 228, McLelland J (as his Honour then was) said at 230: 
     
      
       
        
        It seems to me that the actual and long-standing practice of the court in relation to, for instance, urgent ex parte applications for injunctions, which very often are heard in circumstances where admissible evidence of facts is unobtainable, is supportive of the view that on an application for an interim or interlocutory injunction the court is not necessarily concerned to have evidence which on a final hearing would be admissible to establish particular facts, in order to determine whether there is a serious issue to be tried as to those facts, and that there is a discretion to receive other material relevant to the question of whether there is a serious issue to be tried. 
        
       
      
    14 McLelland J’s reasons in that case reflect the importance of being precise about the purpose of the evidence. In the context of an interlocutory injunction, the evidence was directed to whether there was a serious question to be tried, including what evidence will be, or is likely to be, available at a final hearing: 27 NSWLR at 229-230. 
     
      
    15 Also relevant is the Evidence Act, s 75 which provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        In an interlocutory proceeding, the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence if the party who adduces it also adduces evidence of its source. 
        
       
      
    16 Also potentially relevant (though not because the hearing is interlocutory) is the Evidence Act, s 190, which is relevantly in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The court may, if the parties consent, by order dispense with the application of any one or more of the provisions of:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) Division 3, 4 or 5 of Part 2.1, or 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) Part 2.2 or 2.3, or 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (c) Parts 3.2–3.8, in relation to particular evidence or generally. 
          
         
         
        … 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3) In a civil proceeding, the court may order that any one or more of the provisions mentioned in subsection (1) do not apply in relation to evidence if:  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (a) the matter to which the evidence relates is not genuinely in dispute, or 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          (b) the application of those provisions would cause or involve unnecessary expense or delay. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
       
      
    17 The manner of giving evidence in interlocutory proceedings has traditionally been by identifying the source, eg, “I am informed by”, and stating a belief in its truth. The wisdom of such a course under s 75 can be seen in Chapmans Ltd v Davey (unreported, Supreme Court of NSW, Bryson J, 27 April 1998); though see Heydon JD Cross on Evidence (7th Australian Edition) at 1253-1254 [35595]. 
     
      
    18 In circumstances of the kind referred to by McLelland J in Geoffrey W Hill v King, the Evidence Act, s 9(2)(c) would permit a court to dispense with a rule of evidence. In circumstances where the application of the rules of evidence referred to in the Evidence Act, s 190(1) would involve unnecessary expense or delay, s 190(3) would enable the Court to order them not to apply. Such powers give flexibility to the Court, on application, to accommodate temporal and other exigencies that may arise in any application under s 10. 
     
      
    19 No such application was made here. Therefore, the evidence led before the primary judge must be assessed by reference to the Evidence Act, including s 75. 
     
      
    20 Given the place of the requirement of admissible evidence and given the absence of the affected party, there is no reason not to apply the rules of evidence straightforwardly and according to their terms. If part of an affidavit is inadmissible, it should be rejected, unless, of course, an application is made under or by reference to the Evidence Act s 9 or s 190, and that application is acceded to. 
     
      
    21 Subsections 10(3) and (3A) require affidavits “stating” certain things. The authorised officer must state (a) the relevant suspicion that he or she holds and (b) the grounds on which that suspicion is based. 
     
      
    22 The admissibility of the first statement will cause little difficulty. The suspicion is of the deponent. He or she only has to state it. Issues may arise, as they did in Hadjigeorgiou, and as they do here, as to whether the suspicion is stated with sufficient particularity to enable an assessment to be made as to the reasonableness of the grounds. That is another issue, and is not a question of admissibility. 
     
      
    23 The statement of the grounds needs to be approached with a recognition as to what is being stated. The statement does not require expression of, and admissible evidence to prove, the underlying facts constituting the elements of the serious crime related activity or as to the derivation of the property. What must be stated can be discerned from George v Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104 at 112 and Queensland Bacon Proprietary Ltd v Rees (1966) 115 CLR 266 at 303. The facts that induce the state of mind of the person must be stated. Such facts are not necessarily the underlying facts which constitute the criminal conduct or the relevant derivation of property; they are the matters that have led to, or induced, the authorised officer to the “positive feeling of actual apprehension or mistrust amounting to a slight opinion … more than a reason to consider or look into the possibility of its existence”: Queensland Bacon at 115-116. In other words, the deponent must state why he or she has the suspicion that, for instance, the person in question has engaged in serious criminal activity. 
     
      
    24 What needs to be deposed to will depend upon why the suspicion is held. It may be held because of information received from a third party; it may be held because of what a colleague has said; it may be held because of observations that have been made by the deponent. There is no particular complexity or difficulty about this. However, a deponent does not state the grounds of a suspicion that x has engaged in serious criminal conduct by merely asserting that x has engaged in serious criminal misconduct. Thus, if the deponent says in paragraph 1 of the affidavit “x murdered y”; then in paragraph 2 says “I suspect x murdered y”; then in paragraph 3 says “the suspicion in paragraph 2 is based on the matters in paragraph 1”, he has not stated the grounds of his suspicion. Paragraph 1 is both inadmissible and irrelevant. The bare assertion by the deponent that x murdered y is a conclusionary assertion without foundation in personal knowledge or observation. It is not saved by the Evidence Act, s 75. Nor is it relevant evidence for the purpose of the Evidence Act, s 55 because it does not explain why the suspicion is held. It is not the fact or circumstance that induced the suspicion. 
     
      
    25 With these comments by way of introduction, it is necessary to examine the evidence here. McClellan CJ at CL has set out [2]-[22] of Mr Moerman’s affidavit. The suspicions deposed to in [17] and [19] were stated, in effect, to be based on the contents of [2]-[14]. Mr Moerman deposed: 
     
      
       
        
        Having regard to the matters in 2 to 14 above, I suspect that … 
        
       
      
    26 The appellant submitted that most of these paragraphs were inadmissible. I will only deal with the paragraphs attacked. 
     
      
    27 By way of introduction, the following should be noted. Mr Moerman was the officer who arrested Mr Agius (see [3]). There has been a joint task force investigation between the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Tax Office. Mr Moerman gave no evidence in his affidavit about whether he has taken any part in the investigation, beyond the fact that he arrested Mr Agius. Mr Moerman gives no evidence as to the source of any knowledge as to the matters deposed to in the affidavit. 
     
      
    28 As to [4] of the affidavit, objection is taken to the passage in bold below: 
     
      
       
        
        Agius was arrested and charged following a joint task force investigation between the AFP and the ATO (“the joint investigation”)  
        into an overseas money laundering scheme (“the Scheme”). Agius is the promoter of the Scheme. 
         
        
       
      
    29 The basis for the characterisation of the “Scheme” is not given. Nor is any foundation provided for the assertion that Mr Agius was the “promoter”. 
     
      
    30 The paragraph contains mere assertions of fact, without any basis in personal knowledge or knowledge from material gained in any investigation. 
     
      
    31 Paragraphs 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11 and 14 are all assertions of fact. No basis for Ms Moerman’s knowledge about them is given. No attempt is made to identify how Ms Moerman comes to know of these matters: that is, no information is given as to how the information about these matters can be seen to ground his suspicion. 
     
      
    32 Paragraphs 10, 12 and 13 are in a slightly different category. In these paragraphs, he asserts that the joint investigation has revealed certain things. Nowhere, however, is the source of any such knowledge disclosed. The paragraphs are therefore in the same category as [5]-[9], [11] and [14]. 
     
      
    33 In my view, none of [4] (to the extent it was objected to) and [5]-[14] contains admissible evidence to prove the grounds of the suspicion in [17] and [19] of the affidavit. 
     
      
    34 The above conclusions and the reasons for it are not inconsistent with Hadjigeorgiou. In that case, Giles JA said at 130 [23]: 
     
      
       
        
        Statement of grounds is less than proof of facts. 
        
       
      
    35 That statement should be read in context. His Honour was dealing with an affidavit in a particular form which can be seen in Hadjigeorgiou at 128-129 [13]-[17]. The method of proof of the grounds was clearly admissible in that case. The evidence went directly to explaining by reference to particular documents what it was that led the deponent to have the suspicion. Giles JA was making the point that proof is not required of underlying facts as to criminality; what is relevant is proof as to what it was that the person’s suspicion was based on. 
     
      
    36 That being so, the only ground that was proved for the relevant suspicions was the material in [1]-[3] and [4] (to the extent it was not the subject of objection). 
     
      
    37 The Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), ss 176, 176A and 178BA, being the sections of State legislation to which the suspicion was directed in [17] of Mr Moerman’s affidavit are set out in the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    38 The fact (without more) that Mr Moerman arrested Mr Agius on a first instance warrant on the Commonwealth charges set out in [3] of his affidavit does not provide reasonable grounds for the suspicions in [17] and [19] of his affidavit. No submission was put by the respondent that it did. 
     
      
    39 These reasons are sufficient for me to conclude that the primary judge erred by making the orders in circumstances where there was no admissible evidence before him on which he could conclude that any of the suspicions held by Mr Moerman were based on reasonable grounds. 
     
      
    40 Regrettably, I also disagree with McClellan CJ at CL on another matter, the giving of reasons. 
     
      
    41 It has not been the practice of the Judges of the Common Law Division to give reasons. The primary judge followed that practice. What follows is not intended, in the slightest, as a criticism of the primary judge. My view, however, is that the subject matter of the Act, the nature of the application, including its judicial character, the consequences to the person of a successful ex parte application by the Commission, the lack of an inter-partes interlocutory hearing, the existence of the supervisory appeal and the character of the assessment to be made by the Judge all point to, or are consistent with, the obligation by the Court to provide reasons. 
     
      
    42 I have no disagreement with the relevant statement of principles as discussed in the reasons of McClellan CJ at CL. The giving of reasons is not always an incident of the exercise of judicial power: Housing Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Limited [1983] 3 NSWLR 378 at 386. As Mahoney JA said in Tatmar at 386: 
     
      
       
        
        In determining whether, in a particular case, there is a duty to give reasons and the extent of it, regard should, in my opinion, be had to the function to be served by the giving of reasons. Thus, the statement of reasons may be necessary to enable a party to exercise his right of appeal or such other rights as he may have to contest the decision: this is one of the conventional functions of the requirement: see Pettit v Dunkley (at 387, 388). But in my opinion, the requirement that reasons be given should not be limited to cases where there is an appeal. There is as yet no finally authoritative decision on this question. I think that the requirement should be seen as an incident of the judicial process. However, the fact that the function of the requirement is, at least in part, to allow a party to exercise appeal rights is of significance in determining the extent of the duty and what will be a discharge of it. Thus, in some case where ordinarily an appeal is not contemplated, there may not be a need for reasons. Thus, in England, it has been said that reasons need not be given in certain procedural applications: see Capital and Suburban Properties Ltd v Swycher [1976] Ch 319, at 325, 326. In such cases, and in cases of, eg, applications for leave, where the considerations of fact and law are clear, reasons need not ordinarily be given.  
        
       
      
    43 Tatmar should now, however, be viewed in the light of what was said in Roy Morgan Research Centre Pty Limited v Commissioner of State Revenue [2001] HCA 49; 207 CLR 72 at 83-84 [24]-[26] and 85-86 [32]-[33]. 
     
      
    44 The giving of reasons is a normal incident of the judicial process, especially when the order is subject to appeal: Public Service Board of New South Wales v Osmond (1986) 159 CLR 656 at 667; Pettit v Dunkley [1971] 1 NSWLR 376; and see the discussion in Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Limited (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 at 277-278. 
     
      
    45 Of particular importance in the judicial process is the foundation of the duty to give reasons: “the principle that justice must not only be done but … be seen to be done”: Soulemezis at 278 (per McHugh JA) and see Roy Morgan at 85-86 [33]. 
     
      
    46 Here, the Act deals with the restraint and later forfeiture of the property of individuals. The operation of the Act is of the utmost gravity. The power being exercised is judicial. It is not the approval of a search warrant or a listening device; it is the making of an order, in the absence of the relevant party, for the freezing of property for, potentially, a significant period of time. There is no review at first instance: Ollis; only an appeal. Confidence in the judicial system and ensuring that justice is seen to be done between State and subject require in my view an explanation of the exercise of such a drastic power. That explanation is the giving of reasons. 
     
      
    47 Such reasons need not be elaborate: see Roy Morgan at 84 [26]. It is true, as McClellan CJ at CL points out, there is one ultimate issue for the Judge: the reasonableness of the grounds for the suspicion. In many cases, that will be a straightforward analysis. This will be especially so if the affidavit is clear, specific and admissible. That may not be the case. It was not the case in Hadjigeorgiou. It is not the case here. Though in one sense a simple evaluative task, the assessment of the reasonableness of the stated grounds may require some explanation. Thus, the extent of any reasons will or may vary from case to case. It may be enough to state with economy and conciseness why the suspicion is reasonably grounded. In other cases, if the affidavit is unclear in the possible relationship between the grounds and the suspicion more explanation might be required. A reading of Hadjigeorgiou reveals the difficulties that can be provoked in some cases. 
     
      
    48 Even if the task is straightforward and short (as it may well be in many cases) someone who has had all his or her property frozen indefinitely without notice by an order of the judicial branch of government at the request of the Executive branch of government and without an opportunity to be heard and without an opportunity to persuade the judge to the contrary on a review after the event is entitled to a statement by the judicial branch as to why this has happened and how it can happen in accordance with law. 
     
      
    49 That said, the unitary character of the question on appeal and the existence of an affidavit will rarely, if ever, mean that the Court of Appeal cannot decide the matter for itself. In that respect, the Court of Appeal can exercise its appellate functions without reasons. But that is the case with respect to many issues. If the Court of Appeal has the benefit of the primary judge’s views as to why the grounds are reasonable for the foundation of a suspicion it will be in the position of being able to identify any error. 
     
      
    50 In my view, reasons were required. Nothing in these reasons is directed, or should be taken as relevant, to the usual practice in dealing with urgent ex parte applications for relief in civil proceedings where the defendant will be brought before the Court for an inter-partes interlocutory hearing promptly. 
     
      
    51 If I am wrong about the inadmissibility of evidence, and if Mr Moerman’s knowledge can be understood as sourced in the way McClellan CJ at CL does, I would agree with the conclusions reached by his Honour about the reasonableness of the grounds for suspicion. 
     
      
    52 Whilst I have earlier expressed my agreement with McClellan CJ at CL’s views on Kable, if it were to be concluded (though it was not argued here) that the character of the task was administrative and not judicial, the applicability of Kable might arise. Also, if it were to be considered that a Judge should not, or must not, give reasons (though, clearly, the legislation in its current form does not say so) the applicability of Kable might also arise. 
     
      
    53 Various orders were made by the Court: On 13 May 2008 the Court made orders pursuant to the Act, s 10. On 16 May 2008 the Court made orders pursuant to the Act s 12 for the examination on oath of eight people. An order under s 12 can only be made when a restraining order is or has been made. Given my view that the restraining order should be set aside the orders for examination should likewise be set aside. Also on 16 May 2008, the Court made orders joining the beneficial owners of various bank and shared trading accounts (without naming them) to the proceedings and orders under s 10 in relation to property of the kind made on 13 May 2008 against them. There is no reason why the order for joinder should not be made but the balance of the orders under s 10 should be set aside. Also orders were made on 16 May 2008 relating to the Public Trustee, requiring production of documents by the Commonwealth Bank and by Commonwealth Securities Limited. The orders for the production of documents made on 16 May pursuant to s 12 should be set aside. The order made under s 33(2) of the Act against the Commonwealth Bank of Australia on 16 May 2008 should not by reason of these reasons be set aside. Likewise the order under s 33(2) against Commonwealth Securities Limited. On 20 May 2008 an order was made varying the orders made on 13 May 2008. This order should be set aside. On 27 May 2008 an order was made for the examination of Mr Agius. This order was made under s12. For the same reason that the first order of 16 May 2008 should be set aside so should this be. There may be aspects of any order on appeal dealing with the existing orders that require argument. For this reason I would permit liberty to apply in relation to the order setting aside the orders below. 
     
      
    54 The notice of appeal sought that proceedings in the court below be dismissed. Given my views expressed above I do not see a basis for making that order. 
     
      
    55 In the circumstances in my view the orders of the Court should be: 
     
      
       
        
        1. Appeal allowed. 
         
         
        2. The following orders of the Court in proceedings 12212 of 2008 be set aside: 
        
       
       
        
         (a) orders dated 13 May 2008; 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) orders dated 16 May 2008, with the exception of the order for joinder of certain unnamed parties and of the orders made under s 33(2) of the Act; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) orders dated 20 May 2008; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) orders dated 27 May 2008 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        3. The first respondent pay the appellants’ costs. 
         
         
        4. Liberty to apply within 7 days in relation to the form of order 2. 
        
       
      
    56 BEAZLEY JA: I agree with Allsop P. 
     
      
    57 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This is an appeal from a decision of Hoeben J made on 13 May 2008 to restrain certain property in the control of the appellants pursuant to s 10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (NSW) (“the Act”) and subsequent related orders. The application made by the New South Wales Crime Commission was heard ex parte. The orders which his Honour made on 13 May 2008 were as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Pursuant to section 10 of the  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
       1990 no person is to dispose of, or attempt to dispose of, or otherwise deal with or attempt to otherwise deal with the interest in property of the beneficial owners of the accounts described in Schedule One Schedule Two and Schedule Three hereto (within the meaning of “interest in property” as defined in section 7 of the  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
       1990) in the accounts described in Schedule One, Schedule Two and Schedule Three hereto. 
       
       
      2. Pursuant to section 10(4) of the  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
       1990 the Public Trustee take control of all the interest of the beneficial owners of the accounts described in Schedule One, Schedule Two and Schedule Three hereto in the accounts described in Schedule One, Schedule Two and Schedule Three hereto. 
       
       
      3. Pursuant to section 12(1)(d)(i) of the  
      Criminal Assets Recovery Act 
       1990 the Public Trustee: 
       
       
        
        (a) hold money obtained from the accounts specified in Schedule One and Schedule Two hereto pursuant to order 2 above in the same currency and upon the most favourable at call interest rate available; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) hold shares obtained from the accounts specified in Schedule Three hereto pursuant to order 2 above and invest any dividends at the most favourable at call interest rate available. 
        
       
       
      4. Liberty to the plaintiff and defendant to apply on three (3) days notice. 
       
       
      5. That the costs of obtaining these orders be costs in the cause. 
       
       
      6. Pursuant to Part 36 Rule 36.4(3) of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (“UCPR”) these orders are to take effect as of the date hereof. 
       
      
    58 Schedule One to the orders refers to 48 bank accounts with ANZ National Bank Limited and 4 accounts with Bank of New Zealand. Schedule Two refers to an account with the Commonwealth Bank of Australia in the name of IFTC Broking Service Pty Ltd (“IFTC Broking”). Schedule Three refers to two share trading accounts in the name of IFTC Broking. 
     
      
    59 His Honour made further orders on 16 May, 20 May and 27 May which either made minor variations to the order of 13 May or were in aid of the proceedings. The details of these further orders are not presently relevant. However, the appeal challenges each of the orders. 
     
      
    60 The application made by the Commission was supported by an affidavit sworn by Arthur Berry Moerman, an agent with the Australian Federal Police. He deposed that he is an authorised officer within the meaning of s 4(1) of the Act and is a person authorised in writing to act as an authorised officer for the purposes of s 10 of the Act. 
     
      
    61 Apart from the first paragraph the affidavit reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “2. Robert Francis Agius (“Agius”) has been the Senior Partner of PKF Vanuatu (“PKF”) since 1979. PKF commenced operations as a firm of chartered accountants in 1971 following the passing of legislation in the then New Hebrides which encouraged the establishment of an offshore financial centre. PKF is a member of PKF International Limited which is a network of 380 independent accounting and consulting firms in 119 countries. With many offshore clients attracted by benefits afforded by the tax haven the partners of PKF have accumulated considerable experience in offshore tax planning and are familiar with taxation procedures in many jurisdictions. PKF has 2 resident partners and in excess of 35 staff. PKF owns and manages a Vanuatu government licensed trust company, International Finance Trust Company Limited (“IFTC”). Agius is also the International Liaison Partner of PKF and through this exposure has an interest and knowledge of taxation and accounting practices of most international jurisdictions. 
        
       
       
        
        3. On 28 April 2008, I arrested Agius in Perth, WA on a first instance warrant which had been issued in NSW on 24 April 2008. Agius was charged with the following offences: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) Conspiracy to defraud, contrary to sections 86(2) with 29D of the  
          Crimes Act  
          1914 (Cth) in that between about 1 January 1997 and 23 May 2001, Agius, Fiona McConnochie and divers others at Sydney, in the State of NSW and elsewhere did conspire to defraud the Commonwealth, to wit, the Australian Taxation Office (“the ATO”); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) Conspiracy to defraud, contrary to section 135.4(3) of the  
          Criminal Code Act 
           1995 (Cth) (“the Criminal Code Act”) in that between 24 May 2001 and 23 April 2008, Agius, Kelly Fawcett-Mourgues and divers others at Sydney, NSW and elsewhere, did conspire, with the intention of dishonestly causing a loss to the ATO, being a Commonwealth entity, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) Money laundering, contrary to sections 11.5(1) with section 400.3(1) of the Criminal Code Act in that between about 1 January 2003 and 23 April 2008, Agius, Kelly Fawcett-Mourgues and divers others at Sydney, in the State of NSW and elsewhere, did conspire to deal with money to the value of $1,000,000 or more, and intended for that money to become an instrument of crime. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        4. Agius was arrested and charged following a joint task force investigation between the AFP and the ATO (‘the joint investigation’) into an overseas money laundering scheme (‘the Scheme’). Agius is the promoter of the Scheme. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The Scheme (which commenced in May 1997) operates as follows: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) An Australian incorporated company remits money to a bank account in New Zealand (either with ANZ National Bank Limited or Bank of New Zealand); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) The remittance to the bank account in New Zealand is recorded in the accounts of the Australian company as a trading expenses – being payment for an invoice for some sort of service provided (consultancy fees, management fees, insurance premiums) which service was not in fact provided; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) The money is then transferred to other New Zealand bank accounts (either with ANZ National Bank Limited or Bank of New Zealand). The money is then finally remitted back to either the Australian bank account of the Australian company or a personal bank account of a director of that Australian company. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        6. The primary purpose of the Scheme is to evade Australian income tax otherwise payable by the Australian company. A secondary purpose of the Scheme is to evade Australian income tax otherwise payable by the director of the Australian company. 
        
       
       
        
        7. Agius promoted the Scheme through his trusted friends. One of those close trusted friends was Owen T Daniel (now deceased) (‘Daniel’) who was a chartered accountant operating in Burwood, NSW under the firm Owen T Daniel and Company. Following the death of Daniel in February 2006 Agius continued to promote the Scheme through the successors of Daniel’s business. Twenty companies and 30 directors have been identified as being involved in the Scheme (‘the Daniel clients’). Agius personally promoted the Scheme to the Daniel clients. 
        
       
       
        
        8. Agius arranged and/or prepared all of the necessary documentation, invoices, and loan documentation in connection with the Scheme. PKF charged an establishment fee of AUD$8,000, an annual fee of US$1,380 for maintaining the financial accounts of the Vanuatu company, and a further fee of between 3% and 6% of the money remitted to the New Zealand bank account. For each Australian company which participated in the Scheme a company was incorporated in Vanuatu (‘the Vanuatu company’). The Vanuatu company provided invoices to participants in the Scheme covering the above charges. 
        
       
       
        
        9. The Daniel clients have remitted a total of AUD$21,779.036 to New Zealand bank accounts and the Daniel clients have paid an estimated AUD$1,400,000 to PKF. 
        
       
       
        
        10. The joint investigation has revealed that in respect of one of the Daniel clients there were 11 remittances to New Zealand bank accounts between 24 March 2003 and 11 August 2006. A total of approximately AUD$736,221.83 was transferred to two New Zealand bank accounts. That money was transferred to another New Zealand bank account. The money was then transferred to IFTC. The amount of approximately AUD$635,710 was then returned to the bank account of the director of the Australian company. 
        
       
       
        
        11. Agius is an Australian citizen but resides in Vanuatu as a permanent resident. Agius owns premises at 16/533 Kent Street, Sydney (‘the Agius premises’) and stays there regularly. Between 20 November 2006 and the date of his arrest, AFP lawfully intercepted both the landline telecommunications service at the Agius premises, and a mobile telecommunications service used by Agius. Those intercepts reveal that: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) Agius has direct control and manages the movement of funds from Australia through various bank accounts in New Zealand and other offshore destinations utilising Vanuatu and UK based companies. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) Agius has set up bank accounts in Singapore and the USA because of his belief that New Zealand bank accounts have been targeted and that the USA does not require any form of tax reporting from foreign residents. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) Agius provided false information as to where he would be residing in Australia on his incoming passenger card so that he would not be ‘raided’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) Agius was careful when returning to Australia due to the attention placed on offshore tax promoters. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        12. The joint investigation has identified bank accounts in New Zealand in 49 foreign company names established and operated by PKF and through which over AUD$100,000,000 has been moved since November 2000. Only 26 of these foreign companies have credit funds as at 12 May 2008 (‘the foreign NZ bank accounts’). Those 26 companies, and the associated account numbers are specified in the Schedule hereto. 
        
       
       
        
        13. The joint investigation has also identified: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) an account with Commonwealth Bank of Australia numbered 06 2000 10980897 (‘the CBA account’); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) an Australian share trading account with Commonwealth Securities Limited (a wholly owned subsidiary of Commonwealth Bank of Australia) numbered 577406 (‘the first CommSec account’); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) an international share trading account with Commonwealth Securities Limited numbered 892136 (‘the second CommSec account’), 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          all in the name of IFTC Broking Service Pty Ltd (‘IFTC Broking’). IFTC Broking is incorporated in Vanuatu and the funds in the CBA account, the first CommSec account and the second CommSec account are sourced to IFTC. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        14. Since the arrest of Agius: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) There have been no deposits to any of the foreign NZ bank accounts. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) A total of approximately NZ$10,000,000 has been withdrawn from the foreign NZ bank accounts. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) The General Manager of PKF has sought to increase the cap on withdrawals from the foreign NZ bank accounts to over NZ$6,000,000 per transaction. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) PKF have started using electronic banking to withdraw money from the foreign NZ bank accounts in lieu of dealing directly with the relevant bank for the foreign NZ bank accounts. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        15. As at 12 May 2008 there is approximately NZ$29,000,000 in the foreign NZ bank accounts. As at 1 April 2008 there was approximately AUD$14,100,000 in the CBA account, the first CommSec account and the second CommSec account. 
        
       
       
        
        16. On 28 April 2008 the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions commenced proceedings under the  
        Proceeds of Crime Act  
        2002 (Cth) and restrained specified property of Agius (but not the foreign NZ bank accounts, the CBA account, the first CommSec account or the second CommSec account). 
        
       
       
        
        17. Having regard to the matters in paragraphs 2 to 14 above, I suspect that Agius has engaged in serious crime related activities (within the meaning of ‘serious crime related activity’ as defined in section 6 of the Act), in that he has engaged in offences punishable by imprisonment for 5 years or more, and involving fraud, namely of conspiracy to commit or incitement to commit or of aiding or abetting offences contrary to the provisions of sections 176, 176A and 178BA of the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 (NSW). 
        
       
       
        
        18. Having regard to the Scheme and section 7(3) of the Act the interest in property in the foreign NZ bank accounts, the CBA account, the first CommSec account and the second CommSec account are interests in property of the beneficial owners of those accounts (namely directors of Australian registered companies) and not the interest in property of the corporate entities in whose name those accounts are held. 
        
       
       
        
        19. Having regard to the matters in paragraphs 2 to 14 above, I suspect that the interest in property of the beneficial owners in the foreign NZ bank accounts, the CBA account, the first CommSec account and the second CommSec account are serious crime derived property (within the meaning of ‘serious crime derived property’ as defined in section 9 of the Act) because of the serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities of Agius, in that the money in those accounts are all or part of the proceeds of serious crime related activities. 
        
       
       
        
        20. The joint investigation has not yet identified the beneficial owners of the foreign NZ bank accounts, the CBA account, the first CommSec account and the second CommSec account. Pursuant to a Mutual Assistance Request police in Vanuatu executed 23 search warrants in Vanuatu on 28 April 2008. On 29 April 2008 PKF obtained an injunction preventing AFP access and access of the seized documents and things. 
        
       
       
        
        21. Having regard to paragraphs 2 to 14 and paragraph 20 above, I believe the circumstances require that pursuant to section 10(4) of the Act the Public Trustee take control of the interests in property of the beneficial owners in the foreign NZ bank accounts, the CBA account, the first CommSec account and the second CommSec account. 
        
       
       
        
        22. I believe that the circumstances require that pursuant to section 12(1)(d)(i) the Public Trustee: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) Hold money obtained from the foreign NZ bank accounts and the CBA account pursuant to any control order in the same currency and upon the most favourable at call interest rate available; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) Hold shares obtained from the first CommSec account and the second CommSec account pursuant to any control order and invest any dividends at the most favourable at call interest rate available.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    62 Beyond the matters disclosed by the orders themselves consistent with the practice his Honour did not provide reasons. 
     
      
    63 Section 10 of the Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “10 Restraining orders 
         
         
        (1) A restraining order is an order that no person is to dispose of or attempt to dispose of, or to otherwise deal with or attempt to otherwise deal with, an interest in property to which the order applies except in such manner or in such circumstances (if any) as are specified in the order. 
         
         
        (2) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of:  
         
          
          (a) specified interests, a specified class of interests or all the interests, in property of a person suspected of having engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities, including interests acquired after the making of the order and before the making of an assets forfeiture order affecting the interests that are subject to the restraining order, or 
           
          (b) specified interests, or a specified class of interests, in property that are interests of any other person, or 
           
          (c) interests referred to in both paragraph (a) and paragraph (b). 
          
         
         
        (2AA) The Commission may apply to the Supreme Court, ex parte, for a restraining order in respect of specified interests, or a specified class of interests, in property that are held in a false name. 
         
         
        (2A) A restraining order does not apply to an interest acquired after the order is made unless the order expressly provides that it does so apply. 
         
         
        (3) The Supreme Court must make the order applied for under subsection (2) if the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that:  
         
          
          (a) in the case of an application in respect of an interest referred to in subsection (2) (a)—the authorised officer suspects that the person has engaged in a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based, and 
           
          (b) in the case of an application in respect of any other interest—the authorised officer suspects that the interest is serious crime derived property because of a serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities of a person and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based, 
          
         
         and the Court considers that having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion. 
         
         
        (3A) The Supreme Court must make the order applied for under subsection (2AA) if:  
         
          
          (a) the application is supported by an affidavit of an authorised officer stating that the authorised officer suspects that the interest is fraudulently acquired property that is illegally acquired property and stating the grounds on which that suspicion is based, and 
           
          (b) the Court considers that having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion. 
          
         
         
        (4) When the Supreme Court makes a restraining order, the Court may, if it considers that the circumstances so require, order the Public Trustee to take control of some or all of the interests in property that are interests to which the restraining order relates. 
         
         
        (5) A restraining order may, at the time it is made or at a later time, make provision for meeting out of the property, or a specified part of the property, to which the order applies all or any of the following:  
         
          
          (a) the reasonable living expenses of any person whose interests in property are subject to the restraining order (including the reasonable living expenses of any dependants), 
           
          (b) subject to section 16A, the reasonable legal expenses of any person whose interests in property are subject to the restraining order, being expenses incurred in connection with the application for the restraining order or an application for a confiscation order, or incurred in defending a criminal charge. 
          
         
         
        (6) The Supreme Court may refuse to make a restraining order if the State refuses or fails to give to the Court such undertakings as the Court considers appropriate with respect to the payment of damages or costs, or both, in relation to the making and operation of the order. 
         
         
        (7) For the purposes of an application for a restraining order, the Commission may, on behalf of the State, give to the Supreme Court such undertakings with respect to the payment of damages or costs, or both, as are required by the Court. 
         
         
        (8) If a restraining order is in force in respect of an interest of a person in property, the restraining order does not prevent:  
         
          
          (a) the levying of execution against the property in satisfaction, or partial satisfaction, of the debt arising under a proceeds assessment order in force against the person, or 
           
          (b) with the consent of the Supreme Court, the sale or other disposition of the interest to enable the proceeds to be applied in satisfaction or partial satisfaction of that debt, or 
           
          (c) with the consent of the Supreme Court, the application of the interest in satisfaction or partial satisfaction of that debt. 
          
         
         
        (9) After the first 2 working days of its operation, a restraining order remains in force in respect of an interest in property only while:  
         
          
          (a) there is an application for an assets forfeiture order pending before the Supreme Court in respect of the interest, or 
           
          (b) there is an unsatisfied proceeds assessment order in force against the person whose suspected serious crime related activities formed the basis of the restraining order, or 
           
          (c) there is an application for such a proceeds assessment order pending before the Supreme Court, or 
           
          (d) it is the subject of an order of the Supreme Court under section 20 (Effect on restraining order of refusal to make confiscation order).” 
          
         
        
       
      
    64 The application made by the Commission sought a restraining order in respect of specified interests as provided by s 10(2)(b). As the affidavit of Mr Moerman disclosed, although the Commission was aware of the various financial accounts it had not at the time he swore the affidavit established the name or names of the beneficial owners of those accounts. As a consequence the application did not name individuals or corporations as defendants but merely referred to the beneficial owners of the accounts. The orders were made in the same terms. 
     
      
    65 Since the orders were made the present appellants applied to be joined to the proceedings. Orders to this effect were made on 13 June 2008. The appellants have acknowledged that they are entitled to exercise effective control over the property in the various accounts identified in the orders. Accordingly, pursuant to s 7(3) of the Act the property in those accounts is deemed to be vested in the appellants. Mr Moerman deposed in an affidavit sworn on 16 May 2008 that Mr Agius (and certain other persons) are signatories to the accounts subject to the restraining orders, confirming the suspicion he deposed to in para 11(a) of his original affidavit. 
     
      
    66 The appellants challenged the orders on various grounds. They are shortly described as the constitutional validity of s 10 of the Act; the wrongful admission of various paragraphs of Mr Moerman’s original affidavit; errors by the primary judge in concluding that there were reasonable grounds for suspicion; the failure of the primary judge to give reasons; entertaining proceedings without an identified defendant and entertaining proceedings in the absence of compliance with Schedule J of the Supreme Court Rules. I shall deal with the issues in that order. However, before doing so it is necessary to identify relevant provisions of the Act. 
     
      
       
      The structure of the Act 
       
      
    67 Section 10 of the Act forms part of a legislative scheme by which the State can restrain dealings with property suspected of being the proceeds of serious crime, or property of a person who has engaged in serious crime, pending the determination of an application for an assets forfeiture order. The principal objects of the Act are described in s 3 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The principal objects of this Act are:  
         
         
        (a) to provide for the confiscation, without requiring a conviction, of property of a person if the Supreme Court finds it to be more probable than not that the person has engaged in serious crime related activities, and 
         
         
        (b) to enable the proceeds of serious crime related activities to be recovered as a debt due to the Crown, and 
         
         
        (b1) to provide for the confiscation, without requiring a conviction, of property of a person that is illegally acquired property held in a false name or is not declared in confiscation proceedings, and 
         
         
        (c) to enable law enforcement authorities effectively to identify and recover property.” 
        
       
      
    68 It is significant and, in my opinion, consistent with the appropriate understanding of the Act that the principal objects of the Act do not refer to the making of restraining orders. The power to make restraining orders is a power in aid of the right of the State to seek orders under the Act for the confiscation of relevant property. 
     
      
    69 Section 4 of the Act contains various definitions. For present purposes they include a definition of “illegal activity”, “serious crime derived property” and “serious crime related activity”. The definition of “serious crime derived property” draws upon s 9 of the Act and “serious crime related activity” on s 6. 
     
      
    70 Section 5 of the Act provides that proceedings for a restraining order or a confiscation order are not criminal proceedings (ss(1)). Section 5(2) makes plain that the rules of evidence applicable to civil proceedings apply to proceedings for a restraining order or a confiscation order. 
     
      
    71 Part 3 of the Act contains the provisions which permit the making of asset forfeiture orders. Section 22 provides that the Commission may apply to the Supreme Court for the forfeiture and vesting in the Crown of interests in property that are, or are proposed to be, subject to a restraining order when the assets forfeiture order takes effect. The section provides the regime under which the court must consider and determine whether to make such an order. 
     
      
    72 Section 25 of the Act provides that a person who has an interest in property which might be subject, if made, to an assets forfeiture order may apply to the court for an exclusion order. The Act otherwise provides for orders relieving hardship and for the exclusion of innocent interests (ss 24 and 26). 
     
      
    73 A restraining order made pursuant to s 10 is made in rem but is of limited duration. Section 10(9) provides that after two working days a restraining order will remain in force only in limited circumstances. Section 10(9)(a) provides that it will remain in force if there is an application for an assets forfeiture order pending before the court in respect of the relevant interests. The confiscation provisions in Part 3 operate in relation to property proposed to be or subject to a restraining order: see s 22(1A). 
     
      
    74 Section 10B of the Act provides for an application for a restraining order to be made to the Court by telephone. In the event that an order is made s 10B(5) requires it to be supported by evidence on affidavit no later than 2 working days after the order is made. 
     
      
    75 Section 12 provides for the Court to make ancillary orders. Section 12(1)(a) contemplates an order varying the interests in property to which the restraining order relates. However, this does not entitle the beneficial owner of that property to make an application to have property removed from the restraining order. That right is confined to an application pursuant to s 25 of the Act: see NSW Crime Commission v Ollis [2006] NSWCA 76; (2006) 65 NSWLR 478 at [30]. 
     
      
    76 The nature of proceedings pursuant to s 10 of the Act have been considered by this Court on previous occasions. In Hadjigeorgiou v New South Wales Crime Commission [2007] NSWCA 197; (2007) 174 A Crim R 124 Basten JA queried whether the proceedings were administrative or judicial in nature. However, his Honour and the other members of the court accepted that the power being exercised was judicial power and that any order made under s 10 is interlocutory. 
     
      
       
      The constitutional issue 
       
      
    77 The appellants submitted that s 10 of the Act is invalid as being inconsistent with the provisions of Ch III of the Commonwealth Constitution. The appropriate notice was given under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth). The Solicitor-General for New South Wales appeared and was granted leave to intervene. Neither the Commonwealth or any other State sought leave to intervene. 
     
      
    78 It was submitted that the practical effect of s 10 is to require the Supreme Court to make a restraining order following an ex parte application by the Crime Commission, without affording persons whose rights may be affected any opportunity of being heard. It was submitted that by conferring this power on the Supreme Court the Parliament had enacted legislation repugnant to or incompatible with its exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth as a court invested with Federal jurisdiction under Ch III of the Commonwealth Constitution. It was argued that the legislation is incompatible with the integrity, independence and impartiality of the Supreme Court. The appellants relied upon the decision of the High Court in Kable v The Director of Public Prosecutions for the State of New South Wales (1996) 189 CLR 51 per Gaudron at 103, McHugh J at 118 and Gummow J at 135. Further reliance was placed on the decision of the Court of Appeal of Queensland in Re Criminal Proceeds Confiscation Act 2002 [2004] 1 Qd R 40. 
     
      
    79 Both the Commission and the State of New South Wales submitted that s 10 is valid. It was submitted that in two recent decisions (Fardon v Attorney-General for the State of Queensland (2004) HCA 46; [2004] 223 CLR 575 and Gypsy Jokers Motorcycle Club Inc v Commissioner of Police [2008] HCA 4; (2008) 82 ALJR 454) the High Court has refined the principles identified in Kable with the consequence that s 10 is within the legislative power of the State. 
     
      
    80 Kable was concerned with s 5(1) of the Community Protection Act 1994 (NSW) which authorised the Supreme Court to make an order for the detention of a specified person in prison for a specified period, if it was satisfied on reasonable grounds that the person was more likely than not to commit a serious act of violence and that it was appropriate for the protection of a particular person or the community generally that a person be held in custody. By majority the High Court held the provision to be invalid.  
     
      
    81 The essential principle which emerges from Kable is that a law conferring a function or power on a State court will be struck down if it is incompatible with or repugnant to the exercise by the State court of the judicial power of the Commonwealth, because it compromises the integrity of that Court as an institution and its independence from the Executive and the Legislature (Kable at 107 per Gaudron J; 116, 121 per McHugh J and 133 per Gummow J). 
     
      
    82 McHugh J said of the legislation (at 122-123): 
     
      
       
        
        “The Act is thus far removed from the ordinary incidents of the judicial process. It invests the Supreme Court with a jurisdiction which is purely executive in nature. Indeed, the jurisdiction conferred on the Court is hardly distinguishable from those powers and functions, concerning the liberty of the subject, that the traditions of the common law countries have placed in Ministers of the Crown so that they can be answerable to Parliament for their decisions. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Instead of a trial where the Crown is required to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty of a crime on evidence admitted in accordance with the rules of evidence, the Supreme Court is asked to speculate whether, on the balance of probabilities, it is more likely than not the appellant will commit a serious act of violence. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Having regard to the object of the Act, it is impossible to suppose that the Court has any discretion to refuse to imprison the appellant once it concludes that he is more likely than not to commit a serious act of violence.” 
        
       
      
    83 His Honour concluded (at 124): 
     
      
       
        
        “At the time of its enactment, ordinary reasonable members of the public might reasonably have seen the Act as making the Supreme Court a party to and responsible for implementing the political decision of their executive government that the appellant should be imprisoned without the benefits of the ordinary processes of law. Any person who reached that conclusion could justifiably draw the inference that the Supreme Court was an instrument of executive government policy. That being so, public confidence in the impartial administration of the judicial functions of the Supreme Court must inevitably be impaired.” 
        
       
      
    84 The decision in Kable has been invoked by litigants in appellate courts in a number of cases: 
     
      
       
      (a) in the High Court, see  
      H A Bachrach Pty Ltd v State of Queensland

      (2006) 228 CLR 45;

      ; and 
       
       
      (b) in intermediate appellate courts, see  
      Powercoal Pty Ltd v Industrial Relations Commission of New South Wales  
      (2005) 64 NSWLR 406;  
      R v MSK  
      and  
      MAK  
      (2004) 61 NSWLR 204;

    85 However, there has only been one occasion on which the approach in Kable has been adopted in relation to other legislation. In Re Criminal Proceeds Compensation Act the Court of Appeal of Queensland declared s 30 of the Criminal Proceeds Confiscation Act 2002 (Qld) (“the Queensland Act”) to be invalid. The Queensland Act is the legislative regime relating to the confiscation of criminal assets within that State and is similar, although not identical, to the Act. Section 30 of the Queensland Act expressly stated that if the State applied for a restraining order without notice to any person to whom it relates the court must hear the application in the absence of that person. 
     
      
    86 In striking down the provision Williams JA, who delivered the leading judgment, referred to the decision of Gaudron J in Nicholas v The Queen  where her Honour emphasised the essential character of a court and the nature of judicial power. Her Honour said (at 208-209): 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, consistency with the essential character of a court and with the nature of judicial power necessitates that a court not be required or authorised to proceed in a manner that does not ensure equality before the law, impartiality and the appearance of impartiality, the right of a party to meet the case made against him or her, the independent determination of the matter in controversy by application of the law to facts determined in accordance with rules and procedures which truly permit the facts to be ascertained and, in the case of criminal proceedings, the determination of guilt or innocence by means of a fair trial according to law. It means, moreover, that a court cannot be required or authorised to proceed in any manner which involves an abuse of process, which would render its proceedings inefficacious, or which brings or tends to bring the administration of justice into disrepute.” 
        
       
      
    87 Williams JA concluded that s 30 of the Queensland Act failed to provide the essential elements for the proper exercise of judicial power. Because it provided that only the State could bring evidence his Honour concluded that any decision made by the court makes a “mockery of the exercise of the judicial power in question”. His Honour said (at [57]-[59]): 
     
      
       
        
        “Returning now to the Act under consideration. As already noted the initial order made on an application brought pursuant to s. 28 affects significant property rights in that the property owner is prevented from dealing in any way with the property, and must subsequently discharge the onus of proving that the property the subject of the order was not illegally acquired property if it is to be released from the order. Further, and not without significance for present purposes, the Supreme Court in making the initial order must also be satisfied that the “public interest” is not such as to require the court to refuse to make the order. How could a judge possibly be so satisfied in the exercise of judicial power when the only entity entitled to place material before the court on which a judgment on that issue could be formed was the State? Similarly, how could a judge possibly determine whether or not it was appropriate to require the State to give an undertaking as to damages and costs when the only entity entitled to place material before the court was the State? Asking a judge to make a decision on such issues in those circumstances makes a mockery of the exercise of the judicial power in question. The statutory provision removes the essential protection of the citizen inherent in the judicial process. Effectively the provision directs the court to hear the matter in a manner which ensures the outcome will be adverse to the citizen and deprives the court of the capacity to act impartially. 
        
       
       
        
        Given the reasoning in, and in particular the passages quoted from,  
        Kable 
        ,  
        Bachrach 
         and  
        Nicholas 
        , I have come to the conclusion that the direction or command to the judge hearing the application to proceed in the absence of any party affected by the order to be made is such an interference with the exercise of the judicial process as to be repugnant to or incompatible with the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth. Then, because the Supreme Court of Queensland is part of an integrated Australian judicial system for the exercise of the judicial power of the Commonwealth, such a provision is constitutionally invalid. 
        
       
       
        
        It therefore follows that s. 30 of the Act is invalid. Importantly, it should be noted that the remainder of the Act can work effectively without s. 30. In an appropriate case (and when one is dealing with criminal activity it is often justifiable for such an application to be made speedily and without notice) an application under s. 28 may be made ex parte, and would then be dealt with by the Court as any other ex parte application. The judge would be in control of the proceedings, could determine the appropriateness of proceeding ex parte, and could mould any interim order to ensure that the rights of all parties were adequately protected. Such a procedure would give full recognition and effect to the objects stated in s. 4(2) of the Act.” 
        
       
      
    88 The others members of the court agreed with Williams JA. 
     
      
    89 In Fardon the High Court considered s 5 of the Dangerous Prisoners (Sexual Offenders) Act 2003 (Qld) which provides a legislative regime for the continuing detention or supervised release of persons who had committed serious sexual offences. The High Court held that the legislation was valid. In the course of his reasons Gleeson CJ said of Kable that it established the principle that the Australian Constitution created an integrated court system “and contemplates the exercise of federal jurisdiction by State Supreme Courts. State legislation which purports to confer upon such a court a function which substantially impairs its institutional integrity, and which is therefore incompatible with its role as a repository of federal jurisdiction, is invalid” (at [15]). 
     
      
    90 The legislation under challenge in Kable was extraordinary. Although the original intention was to legislate more generally, the Bill enacted by the Parliament provided for the preventative detention of only one person. Being concerned only with the liberty of Mr Kable the High Court held that the Supreme Court was effectively required to implement the political will of the Parliament.  
     
      
    91 The essential distinction between the legislation in Kable and that considered in Fardon was that the Queensland Act was of general application being a law authorising the preventative detention of any prisoner within the relevant category and not confined to providing for the potential detention of one individual. Gleeson CJ concluded at [19]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Act is a general law authorising the preventive detention of a prisoner in the interests of community protection. It authorises and empowers the Supreme Court to act in a manner which is consistent with its judicial character. It does not confer functions which are incompatible with the proper discharge of judicial responsibilities or with the exercise of judicial power. It confers a substantial discretion as to whether an order should be made, and if so, the type of order. If an order is made, it might involve either detention or release under supervision. The onus of proof is on the Attorney-General. The rules of evidence apply. The discretion is to be exercised by reference to the criterion of serious danger to the community. The Court is obliged, by s 13(4) of the Act, to have regard to a list of matters that are all relevant to that criterion. There is a right of appeal. Hearings are conducted in public, and in accordance with the ordinary judicial process. There is nothing to suggest that the Supreme Court is to act as a mere instrument of government policy. The outcome of each case is to be determined on its merits. 
        
       
      
    92 In Fardon Callinan and Heydon JJ at [219] said of Kable: 
     
      
       
        
        “Despite the differing formulations of the Justices in the majority, the primary issue remained whether the process which the legislation required the Supreme Court of New South Wales to undertake, was so far removed from a truly judicial process that the Court, by undertaking it, would be so tainted or polluted that it would no longer be a suitable receptacle for the exercise of federal judicial power under Ch  
        III 
         of the  
        Constitution

        So long as the State court in applying legislation, is not called upon to act and decide, effectively as the alter ego of the legislature or the executive, so long as it is to undertake a genuine adjudicative process and so long as its integrity and independence as a court are not compromised, then the legislation in question will not infringe Ch

    93 The decision of the Queensland Supreme Court in Re Criminal Proceeds Confiscation Act was considered by the Western Australian Court of Appeal in Gypsy Jokers Motorcycle Club Inc v Commissioner of Police [2007] WASCA 49; (2007) 33 WAR 245. That case was concerned with the power provided by s 76(2) of the Corruption and Crime Commission Act 2003 (WA) (“the WA Act”). That section permits information obtained by police to be denied to an affected party. Once the information has been “identified” by the Commissioner it cannot be disclosed to any person, including a party to any proceedings. “Identification” follows a determination by the Commissioner of Police that premises are heavily fortified and habitually used by persons suspected to be involved in organised crime. In that case the Police had issued a Fortification Removal Notice which could be received by the Supreme Court. The issue was whether the fact that the Act operated to deny a party access to information obtained by the Police relevant to the judge’s decision invalidated the Act. 
     
      
    94 Steytler P observed that there were aspects of s 76 which were antithetical to the judicial process. His Honour said that it was unfair that one party to a controversy that directly affects property rights was able to exclude another party from access to evidence relevant to the resolution of that controversy. His Honour was also concerned that the effect of the provision was that the Court could not explain its decision to an affected party by providing comprehensive and adequate reasons. However, notwithstanding these concerns and notwithstanding what was said in Re Criminal Proceeds Confiscation Act his Honour determined that the legislation was valid. 
     
      
    95 Steytler P gave careful consideration to the discussion of the relevant principles by Williams JA in Re Criminal Proceeds Confiscation Act. He concluded (at [109]) that, having regard to the decisions of the High Court in Fardon and Forge, the appropriate task was for the Court to examine whether the institutional integrity of the State court was interfered with to an extent which meant that it was no longer a fit repository for the exercise of federal judicial power [109]. 
     
      
    96 The decision of the Court of Appeal in Gypsy Jokers was upheld by the High Court. In their joint judgment Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Kiefel JJ said (at [39]): 
     
      
       
        
        “As a general proposition, it may be accepted that legislation which purported to direct the courts as to the manner and outcome of the exercise of their jurisdiction would be apt impermissibly to impair the character of the courts as independent and impartial tribunals. However, as indicated by the result in  
        Nicholas  
        upholding the validity of s 15X of the  
        Crimes Act  
        1914 (Cth), there is no impermissible interference with the exercise of judicial power even by such a significant evidentiary provision displacing the common law formulated in  
        Ridgeway 
        .” 
        
       
      
    97 The appellants emphasised that their Honours were concerned with both the manner and outcome of the exercise by a court of its jurisdiction. However, that passage must be read in context. The legislative provision in question in that case required the Court to determine whether, notwithstanding the opinion of the Commissioner, the disclosure of the information might have the prejudicial effect spoken of in the subsection. Their Honours added that even if the power was expressly conditioned upon the existence of the opinion of the Commissioner this must be understood as requiring an opinion formed reasonably upon the material before the Commissioner. It was for the court to determine whether the release of the information would in fact prejudice the operations of the Commissioner (at [33]). Notwithstanding that the legislation precluded the disclosure of the information to an affected party the manner of the exercise of the jurisdiction nevertheless contemplated an appropriate judicial process. 
     
      
    98 Section 10 of the Act provides for the Commission to make an ex parte application. It is common for a court to entertain such an application when a matter is urgent, in particular where there is a need to protect assets in circumstances where alerting the defendant may cause the assets to be dissipated. Given the nature of the Commission’s function it is plainly essential that it be permitted to make such an application. If it were otherwise many assets which were suspected of being the product of criminal activity may be lost. 
     
      
    99 As I have previously discussed s 10 is the point at which the court process which may lead to the ultimate confiscation of property is initiated. The first step is to restrain its disposition. If a restraining order is made the continuance of the order is dependent upon an application being made for an assets forfeiture order (or other of the orders described in s 10(9)). Before the assets can be forfeited there must be a hearing as provided by s 22 of the Act. Section 22 requires the Court to exercise jurisdiction and make a determination having regard to whether it is more probable than not that the relevant person was, during the relevant period of time, engaged in any of the defined offences. Notice of an application under s 22 must be given to a person to whom the application relates and that person may appear and adduce evidence at any hearing. 
     
      
    100 It is apparent that the Act provides a comprehensive scheme with the principal object of providing jurisdiction in the Supreme Court to make orders for confiscation (s 3). Restraining orders are but an incident of that overall scheme. The making of an order is not mandated by the legislation. The Court is required to consider whether the affidavit supporting the application demonstrates “reasonable grounds” for the relevant suspicion. The section makes plain that the Court is required to make a judgment before a restraining order can be made and is not bound to “rubber stamp” the affidavit. As a consequence s 10(3) raises a justiciable issue and the court has a determinative role in the process of evaluating the application for the making of the order (see Re Criminal Proceeds Confiscation Act [15]-[16]; Director of Public Prosecutions v Toro-Martinez (1993) 33 NSWLR 82 at [91] per Kirby P, [96] per Mahoney JA, and [99] per Handley JA). 
     
      
    101 Although the legislation provides that the Commission may elect for an ex parte hearing when the nature and purpose of the legislation are considered, I am not persuaded that the institutional integrity of the Supreme Court is compromised so that s 10 is offensive to the Commonwealth Constitution. Although a restraining order will in some cases significantly interfere with an individual’s or a corporation’s conduct of their affairs, the Court is required to ensure that in conformity with the legislation the relevant officer holds the necessary suspicion and there are reasonable grounds for that suspicion. Whether there is admissible evidence to support confiscation of the restrained property is a matter to be determined after an inter partes hearing. If the Commission fails at that hearing the restraining order will be removed.  
     
      
    102 I should also refer to two further submissions made by the Attorney-General. 
     
      
    103 It was submitted that the Queensland legislation was significantly different to the Act because the former mandated an ex parte hearing. The Queensland Act provided, in s 28, that the State may apply to the Queensland Supreme Court for an order restraining any person from dealing with property. Subsection 2(b) provided that an application may be made without notice to any person to whom it relates. Section 30 of the Act provided that if the State applied without giving notice, the Supreme Court must hear the application in the absence of any affected person. It was submitted on behalf of the NSW Attorney-General that the NSW Act was different in that s 10 merely provides that the Commission may apply to the Court ex parte but did not require the Court to proceed without notice to an affected party. This formulation was said to provide a discretion in the court to require affected persons to be notified and the matter proceed by inter partes hearing. It was submitted that because the Commission could not mandate the form of the hearing a denial of procedural fairness was not inevitable. 
     
      
    104 I do not accept this submission. It seems to me that if the Commission elects to proceed ex parte the Court must hear that application and determine it in accordance with s 10(3). Because the Court is required to determine the application once made there is no opportunity for it to require affected persons to be notified or heard before an order is made. 
     
      
    105 Reference was made to s 11(2) which provides for notice of a restraining order, if made, to be given to a person who was “not notified of the application for the making of” the order. It is apparent from this provision that the legislature contemplated that there would be circumstances when notification of the making of the application would be given to affected persons. However, this does not mean that the Court has required that notice be given. There may be circumstances, although it would be unlikely, where the Commission itself elects to give notice before applying to the Court for a restraining order. 
     
      
       
      Evidentiary questions 
       
      
    106 The appellants submitted that various paragraphs and portions of paragraphs in the affidavit of Mr Moerman were inadmissible and should not have been relied on by Hoeben J. It was submitted that they were objectionable either as inadmissible hearsay or inadmissible conclusory statements. 
     
      
    107 I do not accept the submission. The purpose of the affidavit from an authorised officer is to provide evidence of the suspicion which he holds and the grounds upon which that suspicion is based. It is likely that his or her suspicion will be based on a variety of matters, some of which may be capable of proof by admissible evidence and others which may not. It is likely and probably inevitable that some of the matters which have informed the suspicion of the authorised officer will be expressed as conclusions of that officer having regard to enquiries which he or she has made or information which has come to their knowledge. 
     
      
    108 As I have indicated s 5(2) provides that the rules of evidence apply to proceedings under the Act. However, it is necessary when considering the admissibility of any evidence to identify the purpose for which it is being tendered. The purpose of the contested evidence was not to prove the fact intended to be asserted by any representation but to inform the Court of the matters to which the officer had regard in forming his suspicion. 
     
      
    109 To my mind the issue for the court is not whether the evidence was admissible but rather whether, having regard to that evidence, whatever it may be, the Court can be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion. If the affidavit is comprised only of conclusions without identification of the source of the information on which those conclusions are based, or is comprised of otherwise unsubstantiated assertions, a court may readily conclude that the affidavit does not disclose reasonable grounds for any asserted suspicion.  
     
      
       
      Reasonable grounds for suspicion 
       
      
    110 In George v Rockett (1990) 170 CLR 104 the High Court considered s 679 of the Criminal Code (Qld) which provided that if it appeared to a justice that “there are reasonable grounds for suspecting or believing” (relevant matters) the justice may issue a warrant directing a police officer to take steps to enforce the law. The High Court made plain that when legislation took this form the court’s task was to be satisfied that there were reasonable grounds for the suspicion but it was not necessary for the court itself to entertain the relevant suspicion. Sufficient facts must exist to induce the relevant suspicion in the mind of a reasonable person (p 112). “It must appear to the issuing justice, not merely to the person seeking the search warrant, that reasonable grounds for the relevant suspicion and belief exist.” 
     
      
    111 The High Court also considered the nature of the facts required to be established to demonstrate reasonable grounds for a suspicion or belief. “Suspicion” and “belief” are different states of mind. “Suspicion” is “a state of conjecture or surmise where proof is lacking” (Hussein v Chong Fook Kam [1970] AC 942 at p 948). The facts sufficient to found a suspicion may be quite insufficient to ground a belief. 
     
      
    112 In Queensland Bacon Proprietary Limited v Rees (1996) 115 CLR 266 at 303 Kitto J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “A suspicion that something exists is more than a mere idle wondering whether it exists or not; it is a positive feeling of actual apprehension and mistrust, amounting to ‘a slight opinion, but without sufficient evidence’, as Chambers’s Dictionary expresses it. Consequently, a reason to suspect that a fact exists is more than a reason to consider or look into the possibility of its existence.” 
        
       
      
    113 The evidentiary requirements for the making of an order pursuant to s 10(3) were considered by this Court in Hadjigeorgiou. Giles JA with whom Santow JA agreed considered the circumstance where the affidavit of the relevant officer identified three offences but did not relate matters in the affidavit to one ingredient or other of any one of the offences. Accordingly, a question was raised as to whether or not, in the absence of reasons from the trial judge explaining that relationship, his decision had miscarried. Giles JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The authorised officer must state the grounds on which the authorised officer’s suspicion is based, and the Court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion. Statement of grounds is less than proof of facts. In my view it permits the course taken by Mr Spark, and a court can reach the requisite satisfaction upon matters contained in the affidavit when they are sworn to in that way. If there be unclarity or ambiguity, that goes to whether there are reasonable grounds for the suspicion.” 
        
       
      
    114 Santow JA added further reasons of his own. He said (at [39] to [45]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The order referred to is a restraining order under the Act. Its scope is potentially very wide and far-reaching. Indeed it is in this case. Nonetheless the Act evinces a clear intention for such an order to be made where those two conditions are satisfied. I do not accept that the supporting affidavit calls for any greater precision than the plain words of the Act require, just because of that wide reach. The legislature clearly intended such an intrusion into personal and property rights where there are reasonable grounds for  
        any 
         such suspicion as is described. 
        
       
       
        
        The High Court in  
        George v Rockett 
         was required to deal with the gradation between reasonable grounds for suspicion on the one hand and reasonable grounds for belief on the other. The judgment (at 116; 254) observes that ""the objective circumstances sufficient to show a reason to believe something need to point more clearly to the subject matter of the belief, but that is not to say that the objective circumstances must establish on the balance of probabilities that the subject matter in fact occurred or exists; the assent or belief is given on more slender evidence than proof"". Moreover ""... the grounds which can reasonably induce an inclination of mind may, depending on the circumstances, leave something to surmise or conjecture"". 
        
       
       
        
        The judgment then discusses what is entailed by reasonable grounds for believing that a thing exists; in particular where the object the subject of search warrant is identified by a description that is broader and less specific. That reasoning as to belief provides no basis for requiring as high a degree of precision in the supporting affidavit when it comes to considering what is entailed by the lesser ""reasonable grounds to suspect"". The judgment concludes, even as to reasonable grounds for belief, that ""in the absence of information in the sworn complaint which  
        might 
         have satisfied the Magistrate as to the existence of reasonable grounds for Rockett's belief, the Magistrate has no power to issue the warrant"" (at 122; 258) (emphasis added). That formulation directs attention to that which ""might"" satisfy the standard. That modest requirement suggests an even less demanding threshold when it came to reasonable grounds to suspect. 
        
       
       
        
        In  
        George v Rockett 
        , there was earlier discussion of the sufficiency of the sworn complaint to show reasonable grounds for suspicion. The High Court accepted that “ 
        the facts which can reasonably ground the suspicion may be quite insufficient reasonably to ground a belief 
        ”. Suspicion requires only that “ 
        some 
         factual basis for the suspicion must be shown 
        ” (at 115) [emphasis added]. Citing Kitto J in  
        Queensland Bacon Ltd v Rees 
         (1966) 115 CLR 266 at 303 this must be more than a “ 
        mere idle wondering 
        ”; rather it must rise to ” 
        a positive feeling of actual apprehension or mistrust 
        ”, though not a positive belief.  
        
       
       
        
        The Court under s 10(3)(b), in determining whether it ""considers that having regard to the matters contained in any such affidavit there are reasonable grounds for any such suspicion"" must be mindful that the inquiry is as to reasonable grounds for suspicion on the part of the authorised officer. It is not for the Court to go beyond asking whether there is sufficient to induce that state of mind ""in a reasonable person"" ( 
        George v Rockett 
         at 112; 251). The Court is in that sense evaluating the exercise of that discretionary determination by another, not exercising the discretion for itself or afresh. 
        
       
       
        
        To introduce requirements of precision beyond that modest level is to my mind unjustifiably to raise the threshold to a level which might more plausibly apply to reasonable grounds for belief than suspicion. When, s 10(3) requires the authorised officer to have a suspicion ""that the person has engaged in a serious crime related activity"" and to state the ground on which that suspicion is based, that does not require choosing which precisely applies of three similar though not identical ""serious crime related activity"" offences so long as at least one does. Nor does it call for a close consideration of each element of those offences to be matched against specific evidence so long as there is sufficient to take the relevant officer to a positive feeling of actual apprehension or mistrust, based on the standard of ""a reasonable person"". 
        
       
       
        
        The Court's consideration under s 10(3)(b) would otherwise be raised beyond a consideration of whether there were ""reasonable grounds for  
        any 
         such suspicion"" (emphasis added). The word ""any"" is to my mind significant here in militating against the necessity for greater precision. It points to the Court's evaluative task as being by reference to the standard of a reasonable person having to have no more than an apprehension or mistrust here as to engagement in a serious crime-related activity. The degree of precision called for in the affidavit should be judged accordingly. 
        
       
      
    115 Both Giles JA and Santow JA concluded that notwithstanding some ambiguity and lack of clarity in the affidavit when the material was looked at as a whole there were reasonable grounds for the relevant suspicion. 
     
      
    116 Basten JA, who reached a different conclusion, said (at [109]) that the affidavit of the relevant officer was inadequate to provide the foundation for a restraining order under s 10 “because the deponent’s suspicions were not stated with adequate precision to allow a view to be formed as to what those suspicions were, which was a necessary preliminary to consideration of whether there were, in the material contained in the affidavit, reasonable grounds for any such suspicion”. His Honour said (at [106] to [108]): 
     
      
       
        
        “The relevance of this material for present purposes is that, on the contention as to jurisdiction accepted above, the restraining order was to be treated as an interlocutory order for the purpose of proceedings which sought the making of a proceeds assessment order. The application under s 27 was not dealt with at the time that the restraining order was made, but it gives further weight to the importance of the authorised officer identifying the serious crime related activity on which he sought to rely. 
        
       
       
        
        The failure to put before the Court full information as to the material placed before Interstar in relation to each of the loan applications makes it difficult to know whether the authorised officer suspected the claimant of obtaining a secured loan, dishonestly, by some form of deception, for the purposes of s 178BA of the Crimes Act. Similarly, it is unclear whether he held a suspicion that the claimant had sought to obtain a loan secured over real property, by some statement which was false or misleading in a material particular. Indeed, to know whether such a suspicion could arise, one might wish to know the full extent of the material placed before Interstar and whether the company thought that it had provided the loan as a result of deception or a false or misleading statement. There would be a certain irony in the Commission obtaining an order that a person pay to the Treasurer an amount equal to the value of property purchased with finance provided by a lender who relied upon the property as security for the loan: cf s 25 in respect of an assets forfeiture order. There is a further irony where the Commission seeks a restraining order preventing the borrower from making payments to the lender from his or her bank accounts, as occurred in the present case. 
        
       
       
        
        These matters do not cast doubt on the fact that the Parliament has authorised such orders to be made: rather, when combined with the absence of discretion in the Court to determine whether a restraining order should be made or not and, indeed, whether a ""proceeds assessment order"" under s 27(2) should be made or not, the importance accorded to the suspicion of the authorised officer is accentuated. The need for that suspicion to be stated with adequate particularity for the Court to assess whether it is supported by reasonable grounds, based on the material set out in the affidavit, is reinforced. 
        
       
       
      Mr Moerman’s grounds 
       
      
    117 In his affidavit Mr Moerman deposed to two relevant suspicions. In para 17 he said that he suspects that Mr Agius “has engaged in serious crime related activities … in that he has engaged in offences punishable by imprisonment for five years or more, and involving fraud, namely of conspiracy to commit or incitement to commit or of aiding or abetting offences contrary to the provisions of s 176, 176A, and 178BA of the Crimes Act 1900.” In para 19 he deposed that he suspects “that the interest in property of the beneficial owners in the foreign NZ bank accounts, the CBA account, the first CommSec account and the second CommSec account are serious crime derived property … because of the serious crime related activity or serious crime related activities of Agius, in that the money in those accounts are all or part of the proceeds of serious crime related activities.” Both suspicions are said to be based on the matters in paras 2 to 14 of his affidavit and are expressed in the language of s 10 of the Act. 
     
      
    118 Mr Moerman identified Mr Agius as the senior partner of PKF Vanuatu (“PKF”). PKF is a firm of accountants which owns and manages the appellant trust company International Finance Trust Company Limited (“IFTC”). 
     
      
    119 Mr Moerman said that he arrested Mr Agius in Perth in April this year and charged him with various offences including conspiracy to defraud the Australian Tax Office and money laundering. His arrest followed a joint task force investigation between the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Tax Office into what Mr Moerman described as an “overseas money laundering scheme”. Mr Agius is identified by Mr Moerman as the promoter of the scheme. 
     
      
    120 Although Mr Moerman does not expressly indicate that he was a member of the joint task force I am completely satisfied that he was either a member of it or that the information and conclusions to which he deposed are derived from the information gathered by the joint task force investigation. The conclusions expressed by Mr Moerman are his conclusions having regard to that information.  
     
      
    121 In para 5 of the affidavit Mr Moerman described the elements of the alleged money laundering scheme. It is simple. As he described it an Australian company remits money to a bank account in New Zealand in purported response to a false invoice. The remittance is recorded in the accounts of the Australian company as a trading expense for a service which has not been provided. The money is then transferred to other New Zealand bank accounts and finally remitted back to either the Australian bank account of the Australian company or a personal bank account of a director of that company. 
     
      
    122 Mr Moerman is of the opinion that the primary purpose of the scheme is to evade Australian tax otherwise payable by the Australian company. A secondary purpose of the scheme is to evade Australian income tax otherwise payable by the director of the Australian company. This latter purpose is allegedly achieved by returning the money originally transferred to the New Zealand bank account to the personal bank account of the director. Presumably it would not be identified as income in the hands of the director and being an expense of the company the effect would be to diminish the company’s tax liability. In this way the director having received the monies directly from the New Zealand bank both the director and the company would avoid paying tax. 
     
      
    123 It is apparent that much of the work of the task force has been conducted by telephone intercepts. Those intercepts have revealed that Mr Agius has direct control and manages the movement of funds from Australia through various bank accounts in New Zealand and other off-shore destinations. They have also revealed a concern that the New Zealand bank accounts have been targeted and as a consequence Mr Agius has set up bank accounts in Singapore and the USA. 
     
      
    124 Mr Moerman said that Mr Agius promoted the scheme through his trusted friends including an accountant Owen T Daniel, now deceased. He described the nature of the arrangements with Mr Daniel’s clients and said that those clients had remitted a total of AUD$21,779.036 to New Zealand bank accounts and have paid fees estimated at AUD$1,400,000 to PKF. He provides, in para 10, by way of illustration an account of one of the transactions. 
     
      
    125 The joint investigation has identified bank accounts in New Zealand in 49 foreign company names established and operated by PKF through which over $100 million has been moved since September 2000. Mr Moerman deposed to the fact that only 26 of these companies had credit funds at 12 May 2008 being the bank accounts in respect of which restraining orders were sought. Orders were also sought in relation to an account with the Commonwealth Bank and share trading accounts with Commonwealth Securities Limited in the name of IFTC Broking Service Pty Limited. 
     
      
    126 Mr Moerman deposed to the fact that since the arrest of Mr Agius deposits to the New Zealand bank accounts have ceased, approximately $10 million has been withdrawn and the General Manager of PKF has sought to increase the cap on withdrawals to $6 million per transaction. 
     
      
    127 Mr Moerman deposed that having regard to the provisions of s 7(3) of the Act the interest in the relevant accounts are interest in property of the beneficial owners of those accounts (the directors of the Australian registered companies) being the persons with effective control, and not the interests in property of the corporate entities in whose name the accounts are held. It was noted in [11] above that the appellants have effective control of the accounts and that Mr Agius and others are signatories to those accounts. The beneficial owners of the relevant accounts have not yet been identified. 
     
      
    128 In the present case Mr Moerman said that he holds suspicions in relation to three prospective breaches of the Crimes Act being s 176, 176A and 178BA of that Act. The Commission submitted that the affidavit supported a suspicion that Mr Agius had aided and abetted a breach by others of these provisions. The relevant provisions are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “176 Director or officer publishing fraudulent statements 
         
         
        Whosoever, being a director, or officer, of any body corporate, or public company, makes, circulates, or publishes, or concurs in making, circulating, or publishing, any written statement, or account, which he or she knows to be false in any material particular, with intent to deceive, or defraud, any member, shareholder, or creditor, of such body corporate, or company, or with intent to induce any person to become a shareholder, or partner therein, or to intrust, or advance, any property to such body corporate, or company, or to enter into any security for the benefit thereof, shall be liable to imprisonment for 10 years. 
        
       
       
        
        176A 
          
        Directors etc cheating or defrauding 
         
         
        Whosoever, being a director, officer, or member, of any body corporate or public company, cheats or defrauds, or does or omits to do any act with intent to cheat or defraud, the body corporate or company or any person in his or her dealings with the body corporate or company shall be liable to imprisonment for 10 years. 
        
       
       
        
        178BA Obtaining money etc by deception 
         
         
        (1) Whosoever by any deception dishonestly obtains for himself or herself or another person any money or valuable thing or any financial advantage of any kind whatsoever shall be liable to imprisonment for 5 years. 
         
         
        (2) In subsection (1):  
        
       
       
        
        deception 
         means deception (whether deliberate or reckless) by words or conduct as to fact or as to law, including:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) a deception as to the present intentions of the person using the deception or of any other person, and 
         
        (b) an act or thing done or omitted to be done with the intention of causing:  
         
        (i) a computer system, or 
         
          
          (ii) a machine that is designed to operate by means of payment or identification, 
          
         
         to make a response that the person doing or omitting to do the act or thing is not authorised to cause the computer system or machine to make. 
         
         
        (3) For the purposes of and without limiting Part 1A, the necessary geographical nexus exists between the State and an offence against this section if the offence is committed by a public official (within the meaning of the  
        Independent Commission Against Corruption Act  
        1988) and involves public money of the State or other property held by the public official for or on behalf of the State.” 
        
       
      
    129 With respect to s 176 as a consequence of the “scheme” it is alleged that a false invoice is prepared and a payment made which would be recorded in the accounts as a payment for a service. That service was never provided. The suspicion that by this means a member or shareholder of the company would be defrauded is supported by the knowledge that in some cases the money is returned from New Zealand to an account of a director of the company rather than to the company itself. 
     
      
    130 The essence of s 176A is that it is an offence for a director of a body corporate or public company to cheat or defraud the body corporate or the company or any person in his or her dealings with the body corporate or the company. In cases where monies are returned to a director the body corporate will be defrauded. In so far as the scheme involves the avoidance of a liability by the company or a director the offence will be committed.  
     
      
    131 Section 178BA is the statutory offence of obtaining money by deception. Both with respect to any monies paid directly to a director of a company, or by reason of the company itself filing a tax return based upon a fraudulent claim, the matters deposed to by Mr Moerman suggest that a breach of this section may have occurred. 
     
      
    132 There can be no doubt that the matters to which Mr Moerman deposed justify the suspicion which he holds. An arrangement by which invoices are created which are utilised to falsely represent that monies have been paid and a business expense can legitimately be claimed for services which have not been rendered suggests at least to the level of suspicion that relevant offences have been committed. 
     
      
    133 The only question is whether, when the evidence before the court is confined to a police officer’s account of the findings of a police investigation and primary documentary material has not been tendered, the Court may be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the officer’s suspicion. It was submitted by the appellants that unless admissible evidence tending to prove the matters upon which the suspicion was based was tendered the application should be dismissed. 
     
      
    134 I do not accept the submission. As Rockett makes plain there is a significant difference between legislation which requires a judicial officer to be satisfied of a particular state of facts and legislation which requires a judicial officer to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for a suspicion held by another. If the judicial officer must be satisfied evidentiary requirements and the obligation to prove matters to the appropriate level will be engaged. When however the judicial officer is called upon to determine whether there are reasonable grounds for another’s belief it is necessary to make the relevant determination by examining the matters which that person has considered in forming their belief. 
     
      
    135 In the present case the foundation for Mr Moerman’s belief is the joint investigation. Being an investigation to assist in the enforcement of the law it is appropriate for Mr Moerman to have significant regard to the findings of the investigation. In short it is reasonable for him to rely on those findings in forming his suspicion. It may be that it would have been preferable if his evidence had included a copy of any report, if there be one, of the investigation and that he explicitly deposed to the fact he relied on matters in that report when forming his suspicion. That he has not taken this approach may reflect the fact that no written document exists, although this would be unusual. Although it would be preferable if it had been put into evidence the absence of any written material is not in my opinion fatal to the application. The views expressed by Mr Moerman are plainly his own views formed from his involvement in the investigation of these matters and are no doubt also informed by the views of others. His view is expressed having regard to a body of collected investigative material. When it is appreciated that significant monies are being removed from Australia to New Zealand in response to allegedly false invoices and then returned, a relevant suspicion must be created in the mind of any reasonable person. Because that suspicion is based on the work of the joint investigation it has a substantial foundation and is in my judgment based on reasonable grounds. 
     
      
       
      Reasons 
       
      
    136 The appellants submitted that the failure of the trial judge to give reasons vitiated his decision. The giving of reasons is an incident, but not always a necessary incident, of the exercise of judicial power: Housing Commission of New South Wales v Tatmar Pastoral Co Pty Ltd [1983] 3 NSWLR 378 at 386. The content of the duty to give reasons will vary depending upon the circumstances and nature of the case. In Soulemezis v Dudley (Holdings) Pty Ltd (1987) 10 NSWLR 247 the applicant appealed against a finding made in the Compensation Court of NSW that she was “fit for all work” and accordingly no longer entitled to compensation. One question was whether the trial judge had committed an error of law in failing to give reasons for that finding. 
     
      
    137 McHugh J, who was in the majority, provides a useful discussion of the development of the obligation in a trial court to give reasons. His Honour concluded that “neither the need nor the appearance of justice requires that reasons be given for every decision made by a judicial tribunal” (p 279E). However, when the decision constitutes what is in fact or substance a final order “the case must be exceptional for a judge not to have a duty to state reasons.” The extent of the duty to give reasons will be related to “the function to be served by the giving of reasons” (see Mahoney JA in Tatmar at 386). It most cases where an appeal lies to another court the giving of reasons including findings of fact will be an essential requirement of the judicial function: Pettit v Dunkley (1971) 1 NSWLR 376 at 387; see also Carlson v King (1947) 64 WN(NSW) 65: see also Beale v GIO (1997) 48 NSWLR 430 per Meagher JA. 
     
      
    138 However, there will be cases where reasons are not required. In Brittingham v Williams [1932] VLR 327 Cussen ACJ said (at 239): 
     
      
       
        
        “…A case may turn entirely upon a finding in relation to a single and simple question of fact, or be so conducted that the reason or reasons for the decision is or are obvious to any intelligent person; or a claim or defence may be presented in so muddled a manner that it would be a waste of public time to give reasons; and there may be other cases where reasons are not necessary or even desirable. But in many cases, of which this was one, we agree with Irvine CJ in  
        Donovan v Edwards 
         [1922] VLR 87 that a judicial officer should state the facts he finds and the reasons for his decision. Such a statement is desirable for the information of the parties, and in order to afford assistance to the Court of Appeal in the event of there being an appeal.” 
        
       
      
    139 In Soulemezis Mahoney JA said (at 269 after considering the decision of the High Court in Public Service Board of New South Wales v Osmond (1986) 159 CLR 656): 
     
      
       
        
        “Three things may be taken from what was there said by Gibbs CJ. First, the reasons given must be sufficient, where there is a right of appeal, to allow that right to be exercised. Secondly, the giving of reasons is not limited to cases where there is a right of appeal: there are reasons in the nature of the judicial process which may require that reasons be given as an incident of the decision in question. And, thirdly, the giving of reasons is a normal but not a universal incident of the judicial process: there are some cases, or kinds of cases, where they need not be given. In so far as it may be relevant for me to do so, I would agree with each of these and see them as applicable in determining what reasoning of fact a judge is under pain of error of law, required to set forth in his judgment.” 
        
       
      
    140 In the present case the decision required of the judge provides the foundation for an order restraining the disposition of property on an interim basis. It is made in order to protect property where the ultimate fate of that property will be determined in confiscation proceedings. The legislation requires a judge to make only one decision pursuant to s 10. That decision requires a determination as to whether the supporting affidavit discloses “reasonable grounds” for the suspicion. That question is amenable to only one of two answers. No findings in relation to disputed facts are required. There may be cases in which a restraining order is sought where the complexity of the relevant facts or the difficulty in construing and applying the Act will require the court to give reasons. However, that case will be rare. In most cases the reasons for the decision, either to grant a restraining order or to deny it, will be apparent on the face of the affidavit.  
     
      
    141 In my opinion reasons were not required in the present case. The affidavit contained a clear statement of the matters which informed the suspicion of Mr Moerman. The only question for his Honour was whether those matters justified a finding that Mr Moerman’s suspicion was based on “reasonable grounds.” There was no difficulty for this Court in reviewing that decision to determine whether error had occurred. This was not a case where reasons were required so that the appellant and the parties would be aware of the matters which influenced the trial judge’s decisions (see Re Criminal Proceeds Act at [63]). 
     
      
       
      Lack of a defendant: UCPR 6.1A 
       
      
    142 The appellants submitted that it was impermissible to commence proceedings in which unnamed and unidentified persons were referred to as defendants. It was submitted that the trial judge should have, but failed, to turn his mind to the question arising under UCPR 6.1A as to whether he should permit proceedings to go ahead without any effective joinder of a “real” defendant. It was submitted accordingly that the proceedings were an abuse of process. 
     
      
    143 Rule 6.1A of the UCPR lists various types of proceedings which may be commenced without a defendant. However, it does not otherwise prohibit proceedings where a defendant is not named. Proceedings under the Act are not included in the Rule. In this case the names of the owners of the interests in the property in question were not known to the respondent. However, the purpose of the proceedings is to restrain the disposition of the relevant property. Although notice of an application for asset forfeiture must be given to a person to whom the application relates (s 22(9)), s 10 does not provide a similar obligation. There will obviously be many cases, of which the present case is one, where the Commission will not be able to identify by name the person with the relevant interest in the property at the time the proceedings are commenced. However, as the restraining order operates in rem it will, if made, be effective to control the property pending the resolution of any forfeiture proceedings. The failure to name individual defendants was not an abuse of process. It must be remembered that in any event the appellants have since each applied to be joined as defendants to the proceedings (see [65] above). 
     
      
       
      Non-compliance with Supreme Court Rules Schedule J 
       
      
    144 It was submitted by the appellants that the combined effect of Pt 12 r 1A of the Supreme Court Rules and Schedule J to the rules is that the Commission was required to file with any initiating process a statement in summary form indicating the general nature of the facts and circumstances relied on. It was submitted that the statement was cumulative upon the requirement for an affidavit contemplated by s 10 of the Act.  
     
      
    145 Schedule J does provide for the filing of a statement in summary form in the present circumstances. However, it would not seem to have any practical utility with respect to proceedings under s 10. It may be otherwise in relation to proceedings for forfeiture. A statement as contemplated by Schedule J would not add to an understanding of the nature of the application which is not already provided by the affidavit which is required under the Act. Being a rule of procedure compliance may be dispensed with by the court: see ss 14 and 56 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005. The failure to file the statement did not deprive the Supreme Court of jurisdiction and could not vitiate the order made by the primary judge.  
     
      
    146 In my judgment the appeal should be dismissed with costs.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Scott David Lynn, pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of Joshua Randle at Parramatta on 14 July 2006. That plea was accepted by the Crown in discharge of an indictment for murder. In April of this year he was tried before Fullerton J for the murder of Mr Randle, but the jury was unable to agree upon a verdict.  
     
      
    Facts 
     
      
    2 An agreed statement of facts recites that on 14 July 2006 the deceased and his fiancée, Toni Kellaway, joined friends at the Woolpack Hotel at Parramatta. They drank together until one of them was refused service, whereupon they moved on to the Hotel Parramatta, where they continued drinking. At 5. 45 pm the deceased and Ms Kellaway left the hotel and walked along Darcy Street towards Hungry Jacks Restaurant on the corner of Church Street Mall. 
     
      
    3 The deceased approached an acquaintance of his, Grant Kelly, who was standing in the mall outside the restaurant. They shook hands in friendly greeting. The deceased looked over Kelly’s shoulder and saw the offender standing immediately behind him. The deceased said to Kelly, “What are you hanging around dickheads for?” Kelly asked, “Are you two arguing?” The deceased rejoined, “Don’t worry, I smashed him once before.” Ms Kellaway, standing next to the deceased, attributes to him the statement, “I will kill you, motherfucker!” She heard the offender say, “Not if I get you first.”  
     
      
    4 The offender reached over Kelly’s shoulder and stabbed the deceased once, very quickly, at the base of the neck above the collarbone. He then ran west through an alleyway adjacent to Berg’s Hobby Store into a rear car park. The deceased staggered after him for a short distance before returning to the front of the hobby store, where he started coughing up blood in the presence of Ms Kellaway and two passers-by. He was laid on the ground, and ambulance officers attended. He was removed to Westmead Hospital, where he died from his injury before midnight. 
     
      
    5 Post mortem examination revealed that he had died from blood loss due to the stab to the upper chest, which perforated a large vein above the heart before wounding the lung. Analysis of ante mortem blood revealed a blood alcohol level of 0.193 g/100ml. He was 167 cm tall and weighed 67 kg. 
     
      
    6 About three or four weeks prior to this incident, both men had fought each other with fists in a public area in Parramatta. Friends of the deceased broke up the fight. Once again, the deceased was intoxicated.7 The offender was arrested on 17 July 2006 and declined to be interviewed. He was released and re-arrested on 18 August 2006, when he was charged with murder. He has been in custody referable to this offence since that date. 
     
      
    8 The Crown prosecutor accepted the plea of guilty to manslaughter on the basis of excessive self-defence, that is, that the offender believed that he had to defend himself but his response was disproportionate to the threat which he perceived. The agreed statement of facts does not identify the weapon which was used. However, I was supplied with the transcript of the evidence before Fullerton J of the forensic pathologist who conducted the post mortem examination, Dr Peter Ellis. From the appearance of the stab wound, Dr Ellis concluded that the offender must have used a narrow blade of some kind, mostly likely a knife. 
     
      
    Victim Impact Statements 
     
      
    9 Whatever might have been the circumstances leading to the killing, the outcome is the violent and untimely death of a man in his mid-thirties. I received a victim impact statement by the deceased’s sister, Ms Melanie Randle, who read the statement to the Court. It describes eloquently the serious and enduring effects of this tragedy upon her and the whole of her extended family, including the deceased’s children. I received a further victim impact statement by Ms Kellaway, explaining equally grave effects upon her and her daughter, who was seven years old at the time of the killing. In the sentence proceedings I expressed my deepest sympathy to Ms Randle, Ms Kellaway, and all those affected by this tragic incident, and I do so again now. 
     
      
    Subjective case 
     
      
    10 The offender was 29 years old at the time of the offence and is now 32. He has a lengthy criminal history, commencing in the Children’s Court in the early 1990’s. Almost all his adult convictions were in the Local Court. Broadly speaking, he has been dealt with over the years for offences of violence and dishonesty, together with drug and driving offences. On a number of occasions he has been sentenced to short terms of imprisonment. 
     
      
    11 More significantly, in December 2000 at Parramatta District Court, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years, with a non-parole period of 12 months, for using an offensive weapon to prevent his lawful apprehension. In June 2004 at Central Local Court he was placed on a bond, with a number of conditions obviously framed to foster his rehabilitation, for using an offensive weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence. I was supplied with the facts of the first of those offences. On 20 February 2000 he was observed by staff at a supermarket at Rosehill to be stealing items. He ran from the store and was pursued. On three occasions during the pursuit he produced a syringe, which apparently was empty, and threatened to use it to stab one of the store employees who was chasing him. 
     
      
    12 As to his background generally, I have a pre-sentence report from the Probation and Parole Service, and the offender and his mother gave evidence. He was brought up in Tamworth. He has an older sister, with whom he maintains contact. Some years ago he had been in a relationship with a woman, and they had two children. Sadly, that woman took her own life. The two children, now aged 16 and 11, have been in the care of their grandmother.  
     
      
    13 When he was about 8 years old, his parents separated and there were bitter and protracted divorce proceedings. According to his mother, there were numerous custody battles, and it appears to have been a disruptive and distressing period for the offender and his sister. Indeed, his mother became emotional in the witness box when she described the effect of these events upon him. It is likely that this disturbed period of his life was the genesis of his conflict with the law.  
     
      
    14 His father died 12 years ago, and his mother has since remarried. He left school during year 8. He has had periods of employment, including work at a car yard run by his stepfather. In earlier years he abused heroin and amphetamines. He ceased using heroin about 8 years ago, but remained a casual user of amphetamines up to the time of his arrest for the current offence. He does not appear to have a drinking problem, and he told the author of the pre-sentence report that he was able to control his drug use.  
     
      
    15 He expressed remorse for what had occurred to the Probation and Parole officer, but it is difficult to assess how genuine it is. He expressed no contrition in evidence, although it must be said that he was not asked a question directed to that issue. He claimed to have little or no memory of the killing of the deceased, including the weapon he had used. I find this difficult to accept. I also found him less than forthcoming when he was cross-examined by the Crown prosecutor about some of his previous convictions.  
     
      
    16 Generally, he did not present as a person prepared to accept full responsibility for his wrongdoing on the occasion in question or in the past. This was also the assessment of the author of the pre-sentence report, who had reviewed his contact with the Probation and Parole Service since 1995. The officer wrote that his response to supervision in the past had “generally been lacking and characterised by failing to address his offending behaviour and re-offending.” Nevertheless, he had told the officer that he was willing to undertake counselling upon his release and he was reported to be “suitable for a high level of intervention by this Service, commensurate with the assessed risk”. 
     
      
    17 He said in evidence that, upon his release, he hoped to stay with his mother until he could find his own accommodation, to resume employment with his stepfather, and to re-establish his relationship with his two sons. In this he has the support of his mother, who also said that his stepfather had maintained a “reasonably good relationship” with him and would “help him wherever he can”. Given his criminal history and what I perceive to be his limited insight into his offending, I am guarded about his prospects of rehabilitation. Nevertheless, the support of his family is valuable and I propose to structure the sentence in such a way as to encourage it. 
     
      
        
      
    Sentencing 
     
      
    18 The offender stands for sentence for a spontaneous killing by an act which was a reaction – albeit, an overreaction -- to a perceived threat. The circumstances must be understood against the background of the earlier incident described in the agreed facts. I emphasise that these observations are directed to an assessment of his objective criminality. I would not presume to pass judgment upon the behaviour of the unfortunate deceased. The offence is aggravated by the fact that a weapon was used. That factor is worthy of some weight in assessing the objective gravity of the offence, although generally it is of limited significance in a homicide case. 
     
      
    19 What is disturbing in the present case, however, is not only that the offender used a weapon but also that he was carrying one. I have referred to his prior convictions of offences involving the use of a weapon. Those convictions are of concern, as is his criminal history generally. I approach that history, including the offences involving a weapon, in accordance with the principles examined by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566. It calls for greater weight to be given to considerations of retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of society in the sentence which I pass. 
     
      
    20 While I have questioned the extent of the offender’s remorse for this crime, I do not think that he is devoid of it. Rather, as I have said, I believe that he lacks appropriate insight into his criminality on this occasion, as he does in relation to past offences. This is something which might develop with counselling. It may be that the tragic consequences of the present offence, which is so much more serious than anything in his criminal history, will set him on that course. It is this, together with the support of his family, that persuades me that his rehabilitation should be encouraged by a finding of special circumstances warranting a departure from the usual proportion between sentence and non-parole period. 
     
      
    21 Counsel for the offender, Mr Wendler, referred to me the remarks on sentence of Adams J in R v Hamilton & Sandilands [2007] NSWSC 452. Hamilton had been sentenced for manslaughter and Sandilands as an accessory after the fact to that crime. Mr Wendler submitted that I would derive guidance from the case, because it was concerned with a plea of guilty to manslaughter on the basis of excessive self-defence by a man in his thirties with a substantial criminal history. Adams J extended considerable leniency to Hamilton, sentencing him to imprisonment for 5½ years with a non-parole period of 2½ years. However, little or no assistance is afforded in the exercise of the sentencing discretion by reference to one other case. Moreover, Adams J was dealing with a case which was unusual on its facts and with an offender whose subjective case, despite his criminal history, was markedly more favourable than the present offender’s. 
     
      
    22 Mr Wendler also submitted that I should pass a sentence of 3 years or less, so that the offender would be entitled to release at the expiration of the associated non-parole period: s50 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. I could not responsibly take that course. Such a sentence would not meet community expectations reflected in current sentencing standards, and would fail to mark the offender’s criminality.  
     
      
    23 It has often been said that it is difficult to determine a range of sentence for manslaughter because it embraces such a wide variety of criminal behaviour. That is not to say that no guidance can be found in a series of other cases; it is merely to acknowledge that they can provide no more than limited assistance in determining the appropriate sentence in a particular case. If regard were to be had to Adams J’s sentence in Hamilton, it would be necessary to consider a number of other cases of sentence for manslaughter by excessive self-defence: see R v Trevenna (2004) 149 A Crim R 505, R v Cakovski [2005] NSWSC 1001, and the other sentencing decisions referred to in those cases; see also R v Forbes (2005) 160 A Crim R 1. As one would expect, even within that category of manslaughter the circumstances of those cases varied considerably, and sentences ranged from 5 years to 12 years. 
     
      
    24 In my view, but for the offender’s plea of guilty the present offence would have called for a sentence of imprisonment for 8 years. I would reduce that by 12.5 % in recognition of his late plea of guilty, leading to a term of 7 years. Finding special circumstances, I would fix a non-parole period of 4½ years. The sentence will commence on 18 August 2006.  
     
      
    25 Scott David Lynn, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 4½ years, commencing on 18 August 2006 and expiring on 17 February 2011, and a balance of term of 2½ years, commencing on 18 February 2011 and expiring on 17 August 2013.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Each of the offenders, Graham Thomas SPICE, Kylie Louise RICHARDSON, David John THOMPSON and Julie Maree McGREGOR, pleaded guilty in the Local Court in respect of offences relating to the theft of money from the Wentworth Golf Club in Orange. They all pleaded guilty to an offence of Break, enter and steal committed on 12 August 2007. Spice, Thompson and McGregor pleaded guilty to the offence of Break and enter with intent to steal on 30 July 2007. Richardson pleaded guilty to accessory after the fact to break and enter with intent to steal on 30 July 2007. They were committed to stand for sentence in this Court. 2 The offence of break, enter and steal is against s.112(1) Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. An offence of break and enter with intent to steal is against s.113(1) and has a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. Pursuant to s.350, an accessory after the fact to such an offence is liable to a penalty of imprisonment for 5 years.FACTS3 There is an agreed statement of facts before me from which I derive the following.4 Spice and Richardson lived in a defacto relationship at 251 Lone Pine Avenue, Orange. Richardson was employed as a bar attendant at the Wentworth Golf Club. McGregor and Thompson lived at Penrith.5 Spice and Thompson arranged to break and enter the golf club in order to steal money. An agreement was reached that they would do this on 30 July 2007. On that day Thompson and McGregor drove from Penrith to the home of Spice and Richardson. At about 5.30am, McGregor drove the two men to the golf club with the knowledge that they intended to break into it and steal money. She then drove away and waited for a phone call to pick them up. 6 The golf club was broken into by making a hole through the cool room roof which led into the club but this caused the alarm to be activated. Spice and Thompson ran off and were separated. Spice contacted Richardson who came and picked him up and took him back to Lone Pine Avenue. On the journey home he disclosed to her what had happened. Thompson contacted McGregor and she picked him up and they also returned to Lone Pine Avenue. 7 There was a subsequent agreement reached between the 4 offenders that Spice and Thompson would again break into the golf club on 11 August 2007. A series of SMS messages were sent between Spice and Thompson prior to that date.8 Richardson was on duty at the golf club that evening and after completing her shift the offenders met at her Lone Pine Avenue home. Spice and Thompson were driven to the club by McGregor. She knew what they were intending to do. After dropping them off she waited for a call from Thompson.9 The golf club was again entered through the roof. Access was gained to the safe via the cool room and kitchen through a door which had been left unlocked. SMS messages were exchanged between Spice and Thompson while this was happening. An amount of $25,266.78 was stolen from the safe. McGregor, Spice and Thompson returned to the Lone Pine residence where the proceeds of the theft were counted by the offenders. Thompson gave Richardson and Spice a portion of the proceeds for their involvement. Thompson and McGregor then returned to Sydney. Richardson and Spice drove to Forbes where they spent a part of the proceeds.10 When subsequently interviewed by police Richardson denied any knowledge of either offence. Spice initially denied involvement but later made admissions that on each occasion he played the role of lookout outside the club. McGregor is said to have made full and frank admissions about her involvement. Thompson denied involvement in either offence.11 The offenders Spice and Richardson were arrested on 25 September 2007. The offenders McGregor and Thompson were arrested on 17 and 18 October 2007 respectively.EVIDENCE OF OFFENDERS AT SENTENCE HEARING12 The hearing of this matter commenced before me at the Orange sittings on 29 August 2008 and continued in Sydney on 24 October. It became apparent that there are a considerable number of relevant matters not addressed in the Agreed Facts document. To cite just one example, there is reference to Ms Richardson being on duty at the golf club on 11 August 2007 and to the four offenders meeting shortly after she finished her shift. I thought it was a relevant matter to inquire whether her employment at the club was used in any way by the offenders to plan the break- in or to assist in the execution of the plan. It seems rather unlikely that one of the offenders was in possession of the key and combination to the safe and yet the offenders did not make any use of this potential inside assistance. Another example is that the offender Spice claimed that on both occasions he simply waited outside. His evidence was to the effect that the plan to rob the club originated with Thompson. Thompson, however, said in his evidence that Spice had approached him about it. He also said that Spice entered the premises with him on both occasions. There was some discussion at the hearing on 24 October as to whether I could find facts beyond those set out in the Agreed Facts. It was agreed by the Crown and the representatives of each of the offenders that I should confine myself to that document. The agreement included that I should disregard the evidence given by the offenders that touched upon the offence itself, including that which tended to suggest a minimisation of an offender’s role.13 Given this was a position taken by all parties I propose to confine myself in the manner suggested. I must say, however, that I am uncomfortable about this because it is obvious that I have not been told the complete truth in the evidence I have heard from the offenders. The conflict between the evidence of Spice and Thompson that I have just referred to is one example. Nevertheless, I will put that to one side and proceed in the way the parties wish. Given that I cannot determine whether an individual offender was being truthful in the account he or she gave about the offences, it would be inappropriate for me to take into account any of the explanations they gave for their involvement in the offences, and what they did afterwards with the proceeds of the theft. I will only act upon evidence they gave concerning their respective personal circumstances. SUBJECTIVE FEATURES – SPICE14 The offender Spice was born on 30 August 1979 and so he was 27 at the time of the offences.15 He has a criminal history comprising four matters of stealing, one of break, enter and steal, and five of malicious damage in the Children’s Court. As an adult there are matters of assault, property damage, offensive behaviour and traffic offences. All matters were dealt with by way of fines and bonds. It is a record that denies to him the leniency that could be extended to a person without such a record.16 He has been on bail in respect of this matter since arrest but was in custody on remand for unrelated matters from 19 April to 27 May 2008.17 He was born and raised in the Forbes area where he presently lives with his mother and step-father. He has no knowledge of his biological father. He was diagnosed with ADHD when at primary school and was prescribed medication for it until he was in Year 8. He has a number of half siblings and he is closest to Robert who is about a year younger than him. Robert has experienced a difficulty with a drug addiction. The offender is said to have feelings of attachment, concern and responsibility for him. His step-father came into the family when the offender was 10. He did not get on well with him and left home in his mid-teens to live with his step-father’s brother who, apparently, subjected him to sexual abuse over a period of about a year. He did not complain about it at the time but told others about it some 4 years later. 18 He completed an apprenticeship as a boilermaker on leaving school after the School Certificate and he has been in continuous employment in his trade since then. He presently has a job in Bathurst and he commutes daily from Forbes. Inquiries by the Probation and Parole Service indicate that the offender is a valued and skilled tradesman. The fact that he is travelling some 350 km per day from Forbes to Bathurst and return shows a rather extraordinary commitment to his employment.19 He was married at the age of 21 and has two children from that relationship who are aged 6 and 4. That relationship ended in 2004. He has another 4 year old child from another contemporaneous relationship. He met the offender Richardson when he moved to Orange and they were in a relationship for some 2 years but that has ended. Ms Robilliard, psychologist, suggests that the offender should commit to psychotherapy in order to deal with problems of commitment and attachment which have caused dysfunctional behaviour in relationships which he needs to address. She said he gave no history of treatment for mental illness or depression but did report three past attempted suicide events. No ongoing mental health management was arranged in relation to any of these episodes.20 Alcohol has been an enduring problem in his life. He commenced drinking at the age of 11 or 12. It was freely available to him when he was living with his step-father’s brother and his consumption increased when he moved out to live independently. His steady and consistent employment history indicates that he did not allow alcohol consumption to become totally destructive. He said in his evidence that he had been abstinent since early June this year and has found he is now thinking more clearly. He is attending AA meetings and intends to remain abstinent. Testing by Ms Robilliard revealed what she says is a highly significant score on the Substance Abuse Inventory which demonstrated a significant level of psychological and emotional distress. She refers to his past suicidal gestures as emphasising the need for his mental health to be managed and monitored.21 On a positive note Ms Robilliard reports that the offender’s commitment to employment is a “major protective factor which could be utilised in his ongoing supervision and management by allowing him to remain employed”. She says, “it would provide a central structure around which other interventions in the areas of drug and alcohol education, mental health care management and monitoring including psychotherapy could assist and support”. She recommends a period of supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. 22 The first Pre Sentence Report that was prepared in relation to Spice includes that he was assessed as suitable for a “medium level of intervention” by the Service. He was assessed as unsuitable for community service or periodic detention because of unresolved alcohol dependency. I note that this assessment was conducted when the offender was in custody in May and before his present period of abstinence commenced. A second Pre Sentence Report dated 28 August 2008 is in more positive terms. He is now assessed as suitable for community service and periodic detention on the basis of his new found sobriety.23 When the offender Spice was asked in his evidence how he felt about the offences he said that he wished he could go back to that night. When asked why he said, “because that’s not me”. He was asked how he felt about the victim club and its members and he said that he was sorry for it and them. Later, he said that he accepted responsibility. 24 Section 21A(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“Sentencing Procedure Act”) provides that the mitigating factors to be taken into account in determining the appropriate sentence for an offence include: 
     
      
      (i) the remorse shown by the offender for the offence, but only if:  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (i) the offender has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions, and 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his or her actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both), 
        
       
      
    25 Mr Spice has been in employment but there is no suggestion of him even offering to make any contribution to compensating the victim golf club, or its insurers, for the loss and damage. Whilst I am satisfied that he has accepted responsibility, he has not acknowledged the loss and damage that was caused by his actions nor made reparation. As a consequence I am not satisfied that he is remorseful. 26 I accept that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. His strong work ethic and the positive steps he has taken to overcome his long standing problem with alcohol abuse strongly support such findings.27 The offender entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court on 15 April 2008, a little over 6 months after he was charged. It cannot be said that they were pleas of guilty entered at the earliest opportunity. For the utilitarian benefit to the criminal justice system I propose to discount the sentences I would otherwise have imposed upon him by 20%.28 The offender was in custody from 19 April to 27 May 2007 but that was because he was charged with unrelated matters arising from some domestic incident. When he was charged with those matters his bail for the present matters was also revoked. Those other proceedings were subsequently dismissed. In these circumstances it seems appropriate to allow credit for that period of 39 days of pre sentence custody.29 Mr Allen, counsel for the offender Spice, submitted that imprisonment was an appropriate starting point but that I should consider ordering that it be served by way of periodic detention, or that I should suspend execution of such sentence pursuant to s.12 Sentencing Procedure Act. 30 Mr Allen submitted that if I was to sentence his client to full-time imprisonment I should find special circumstances and reduce the non-parole period. The reasons he advanced for this were the offender’s need for psychotherapy and counselling, his good prospects of rehabilitation, his background, and this being his first sentence of imprisonment. SUBJECTIVE FEATURES – RICHARDSON31 The offender Richardson was born on 9 July 1970 and so she was 37 at the time of the offences. 32 She has no previous convictions. This, and the fact of her prior good character, are very much in her favour.33 She was born in South Australia but brought up in the Orange area in a stable and supportive family environment. She told me in her evidence that she was married when she was 19 or 20 but that relationship ended some 3 years ago. She has 4 boys aged between 11 and 18. The 3 youngest live with her whilst the eldest alternates between living with her and his father. She commenced a relationship with the offender Spice after the marriage ended but that relationship came to an end following their arrest. She continues to reside in Orange with her children.34 She was educated to Year 10 and has been in employment since with the exception of when her children were very young. She had been working at the Wentworth Golf Club for 3 months prior to the offences. At the time of giving evidence she had just started work as a housemaid.35 She was asked how she felt about having committed the offences and she said she hated what had happened, felt awful and did not like thinking about it. She said she did not know how she got herself into this mess and that “it just happened”. She said she realised the seriousness of the offences and that she was facing full-time imprisonment. She said she would never become involved in criminal activity again. The author of the Pre Sentence Report states that she has shown remorse. I am prepared to find that she has accepted responsibility for her actions, although barely. I cannot be satisfied, however, that she has acknowledged the loss and damage caused, or that she has made, or even attempted to make, any reparation for such loss and damage. So, as with Mr Spice, I cannot be satisfied that she is remorseful.36 Ms Tammy Lee Parrington was called to give evidence in the case for Richardson. She has been a friend of the offender for about 9 years and described her as “honest, great, good in every way”. She also said she was a “great mother” to her 4 sons. She considered that the offender’s involvement in the offences was out of character. Testimonials by Ms Parrington and 5 other people became Exhibit R1. They further confirm the positive opinion Ms Parrington has about the offender.37 There is material in these testimonials and in the Pre Sentence Report that indicate that her relationship with the offender Spice was a negative one. Friends and family apparently became concerned about his influence upon her. She has no contact with him now and she is fortunate to have retained the support of those friends and her family.38 Accepting that involvement in these offences was out of character, I am prepared to accept that she has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. The Probation and Parole Officer was also of the view that the offender had a low risk of re-offending and indicated that she would not appear to benefit from supervision by her Service. She was assessed as suitable for community service and periodic detention.39 Ms Richardson entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court on 15 April 2008, a little over 6 months after she was charged. If I was to impose a sentence of imprisonment I would discount it by 20% for the same reasons I indicated in relation to the offender Spice. 40 Ms Hall, counsel for Ms Richardson, submitted that I should impose upon her client some sentence other than full-time imprisonment. She suggested a community service order or a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention. SUBJECTIVE FEATURES – THOMPSON41 The offender Thompson was born on 6 February 1973 and so he was 34 at the time of the offences.42 He has a criminal history comprising convictions for a number of driving offences. It is not a significant record in the context of the present case and that is something I am required to take into account in his favour.43 He was born and raised in the western suburbs of Sydney. He has strong family ties and good support from his parents and two brothers. He left school in Year 9 to commence full time work. He did some labouring work and then completed an apprenticeship as a boilermaker. He has successfully remained in employment in a variety of positions since. His last job involved him being in charge of a team of men working on railway tracks throughout country New South Wales. He has specialist qualifications in types of welding that are quite rare. He was in that position for some 6 years and it is said he is able to return to it once this matter is behind him. 44 He was married in 2001 and has 2 sons. He was away from home a lot because of his work and this undoubtedly placed pressure on the marriage. Sometime in early 2007 they had a disagreement which resulted in their separation. He attempted to remain in contact with his children but has not seen them since being in custody. 45 Two weeks after moving out of the matrimonial home there was a motor vehicle accident in which one of his workers was killed and others seriously injured. As the offender had sent the workers on the trip he blamed himself for this. 46 He has used alcohol and cannabis in significant quantities since his teenage years. When he separated from his wife he commenced using amphetamine. He said that this helped him to not think about the death of his co-worker, his failed marriage, and the reduced contact with his sons. At its worst, he was spending about $1000 per day on drugs.47 He became involved in a relationship with his co-offender McGregor in this post separation period. She was also an amphetamine user. He has described his life in the 3 months or so before the offences as “absolute chaos”. He attributes his involvement in the offences, and now being in gaol, to this, what he described as, “out of character behaviour”. 48 Mr Dennis Thompson, the offender’s father, gave evidence before me. He confirmed that the offender was significantly adversely affected by the breakdown of his marriage. Mr Thompson was not aware of the extent of his son’s substance abuse but from what his son has been saying to him in recent times he feels there are positive signs for his recovery.49 The offender himself said in his evidence that he is motivated to pursue rehabilitation. He has been attending AA meetings in Bathurst Correctional Centre as often as they are available. In fact, he said there were no AA meetings when he was first there but he and some other inmates got together and started them up. He confirmed in his evidence the accuracy of what appears in the psychological report from which I have drawn the personal history I have just been referring to. He also confirmed his enthusiasm for work and the pride that he obviously has in his trade skills. 50 Personality testing was carried out by the psychologist, Ms Margaret Johnson. She indicates in her report that the results should be viewed with a degree of caution for reasons she sets out. The findings relate to the effects upon the offender’s life of alcohol and drug abuse. She suggests that he experienced more adverse effects than others with such problems. It is a matter of degree. I do not think there is anything significant in this beyond the acknowledgement that he was a person that had a problem with substance abuse. Other personality tests, according to Ms Johnson, indicate a number of possible negative characteristics but the equivocal way in which the findings are expressed lead me disregard them. 51 Ms Johnson recommends that Mr Thompson undergo a drug and alcohol rehabilitation program. She also recommends treatment to assist him in dealing with grief and loss arising from the breakdown of his marriage and the motor vehicle accident his work colleagues were involved in. 52 It is a positive indicator for his rehabilitation prospects that the offender of his own volition has sought out a suitable drug and alcohol rehabilitation program at The Glen. A letter is before me which indicates that he has been assessed as suitable for admission to that program. 53 The Pre Sentence Report for Mr Thompson recounts a history that is consistent with that in Ms Johnson’s report. The offender was assessed as suitable for a medium level of intervention by the Probation and Parole Service. The report states that strategies would include drug and alcohol assessment and counselling with a view toward entry into a residential rehabilitation centre if assessed as suitable. He is said to be unsuitable for community service and periodic detention because of unresolved drug and alcohol dependence. 54 Mr Thompson entered his pleas of guilty in the Local Court but not, in my view at what could be said to be the “earliest opportunity”. He knew he was guilty from the beginning. A submission was made that I should make some allowance for the fact, which the Crown concedes, that he did not have adequate legal representation for quite some months. That may well be the explanation but an assessment of the utilitarian benefit accruing to the criminal justice system from pleas of guilty must be made objectively. I will discount the sentences to be imposed by 20%. 55 I am satisfied that Mr Thompson has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend, provided that he pursues the course of rehabilitation that he has commenced and proposes to continue. His family support and strong work ethic are relevant matters to these findings.56 There was no submission that I should find that Mr Thompson is remorseful. That is understandable because there is no evidence in terms of s.21A(3)(i) Sentencing Procedure Act that he is.57 Mr Rolfe, who appeared for Mr Thompson, submitted that I should consider dealing with his matter under s.11 Sentencing Procedure Act. In view of the sentence that must inevitably be imposed I do not think that is a viable or appropriate option.SUBJECTIVE FEATURES – McGREGOR58 The offender McGregor was born on 18 December 1968 and so she was 38 at the time of the offences.59 She has previous offences relating to drugs and weapons that were dealt with in a magistrate’s court in Queensland in January 2007. No convictions were recorded and she was fined so I accept that they were relatively minor matters. Aside from those matters I am prepared to accept that she has been of good character and will take this into account in her favour.60 She had a rather dysfunctional upbringing. Her mother had some mental instability and did not offer affection. Her father was away a lot with his work but when home showed violence to her and her siblings. She claims to have been sexually abused by her older brother Nick from the age of 10 to 15. She says that he introduced her to drugs and that all her siblings were involved in drug use. In her adult years she has had varying, but mostly limited, contact with her siblings, occasional contact with her mother and some contact with her father.61 She was educated to Year 9 when she was expelled for drug possession and shoplifting. She has had employment, mostly as a short-order cook, but has not been employed in the past couple of years.62 When she was 18 and living away from home she fell pregnant. She rang her mother to tell her. She says her father then picked her up and took her to an abortion clinic, telling her to “sort it out”. At the age of 19 she met her now ex-husband and moved in with him. She had a son to him in 1992. The relationship was marred by domestic violence and mutual substance abuse and they separated following a violent assault upon her in 2006. She was hospitalised as a result of that assault and he spent some time in gaol. Her son now resides with his father on the north coast of NSW. The offender commenced a relationship with the offender Thompson in February 2007. She told Ms Wakely, psychologist, that she had no money or possessions and that Thompson offered to pay her if she would drive him around for work. She said she never saw any money but instead would be supplied with drugs. She said the relationship deteriorated because of his increasing drug use and that 10 days after the offence he left her for a younger woman.63 Overall, Ms Wakely says that the offender has a “history of unhealthy dependency and instability in relationships and reacts strongly to threats of abandonment, regardless of how dysfunctional the relationship seems to have been at the time”. 64 The offender reported to Ms Wakely that she had attempted suicide on some 10 occasions in her life, the last in 2007. She has been diagnosed with depression and has been on Efexor and Zyprexa.65 Her substance abuse started with cannabis at the age of 14 and continued on a daily basis until last year. She has used amphetamine off and on and described her use of this drug last year as most problematic. She has also used ecstasy and has abused prescription drugs. Ms Wakely offers the opinion that the offender has used substances as a coping mechanism to help block the negative experiences in her life. The offender said in her evidence that she used drugs as a means of coping with bouts of depression. She has not used any illegal drugs since December 2007. It was then that she commenced rehabilitation treatment through Jarrah House and after completion of that 3 month program she was accepted into Kamira Farm Women's Drug & Alcohol Rehabilitation Centre at Wyong. Ms Wakely saw the offender at Kamira Farm in June. She said that “at the time of interview her resolve to remain substance free and complete her treatment appeared to be fragile”. In the subsequently prepared Pre Sentence Report it is said that the offender had discharged herself from Kamira Farm after completing 4 months of the 6 – 12 month program. The offender claimed this was because she was not achieving the desired outcome but a report from Kamira stated that she chose to discharge herself after an incident with her counsellor.66 The offender gave evidence about the rather strict conditions she encountered at both Jarrah House and Kamira Farm. This prompted her counsel to submit that I should take this into account as quasi custody. Although counsel indicated in written submissions that bail conditions required her client to remain in residential rehabilitation, in oral submissions it was conceded that this was not the case. It was submitted that compliance with strict conditions of a residential rehabilitation program can amount to quasi custody and should therefore be taken into account in mitigation whether or not the offender was compelled by court order to enter or remain in such a program. I can find no authority in support of that proposition and none was suggested. 67 The authorities I have looked at are: R v Eastway (unrep, 19/5/92, NSWCCA); R v Everingham (unrep, 4/7/94, NSWCCA); R v Psaroudis (unrep, 1/4/96, NSWCCA); R v Campbell [1999] NSWCCA 76; R v Thompson [2000] NSWCCA 362; R v Perry [2000] NSWCCA 375; R v Fowler (2003) 151 A Crim R 166; R v Delaney (2003) 59 NSWLR 1; R v Sullivan (2004) 41 MVR 250; R v Cartwright (1989) 17 NSWLR 243; R v Kivits (unrep, 4/11/93, NSWCCA); R v Dennis (unrep, 14/12/92, NSWCCA); R v Williams (unrep, 5/8/93, NSWCCA); R v Kennedy (unrep, 31/8/93, NSWCCA); R v Sayak (unrep, 16/9/93, NSWCCA); R v Herbert (unrep, 4/11/93, NSWCCA); R v Kirwin (unrep, 30/10/97, NSWCCA); R v Hanley (unrep, 9/10/98, NSWCCA); R v Khamas (1999) 108 A Crim R 499; R v Fowler (2003) 151 A Crim R 166; R v Webb (2004) 149 A Crim R 167. In each of them, except Psaroudis, the offender was compelled by a court order of some form to endure a period of quasi custody, or otherwise onerous bail conditions. In Psaroudis, the judgment is silent on the point. What I gather from the authorities is that where an offender is compelled by court order to endure some onerous requirement, then that is a matter that may be taken into account in the offender’s favour on sentence.68 I have examined the court file. It seems that upon committal for sentence to this court the offender’s bail conditions were varied by changing a requirement that she reside at a nominated address to reflect the fact that she was then living at Karima Farm. Provision was made for her to report to police, and the like, if she left. It appears to me that there was no court compulsion as such for her to reside in a residential rehabilitation program. Rather, it was an exercise of bringing her bail conditions into line with her changed residential arrangements. It was her own choice to enter such a program and, if she wished, to leave. That is in fact what she did. I conclude that it would not be appropriate to make an allowance for “quasi custody”. The true relevance of the offender’s time spent in a residential program is in relation to her rehabilitation itself. The fact that she was prepared to undergo such programs, with the strict conditions that she spoke of in her evidence, says much about her motivation to pursue rehabilitation.69 The offender said in her evidence that since commencing in rehabilitation she has not used drugs and this has been for the longest period in her adult life. Since leaving the program at Kamira Farm she has been living with her father and step-mother at Wilberforce and has been seeing a counsellor every week. She said she is also attending NA meetings each Thursday night. Another matter that bodes well for her remaining abstinent from drugs is that she has returned to taking prescribed medication for depression and she now realises the link between her taking illegal drugs and her not dealing with her depression by taking such medication. The stability of living with her father and having employment is also useful. 70 The offender has also had a problem with gambling and she told Ms Wakely that this was at its worst in 2007 when she was putting as much as she could through poker machines. In the Pre Sentence Report it is indicated that she would often gamble up to $500 per day.71 She said that after the offender Thompson left her shortly after the offences she went on a binge of Zyprexa tablets which led to her admission to a psychiatric ward. Upon release she became increasingly angry with Thompson and called the police to report what they had done. Ms Wakely reports the offender as having said she was, “sick of using drugs and upset about the situation and her involvement”. She told Ms Wakely, “I regret it big time, that’s why I dobbed us in. It was only because I trusted him and I wanted my life sorted ... he said he’d help me”. 72 Testing by Ms Wakely revealed that the offender had a high probability of substance dependence disorder but some of the scores indicate that she has begun to develop insight into her substance abuse problems and the underlying causes.73 Ms Wakely concludes her report as follows: “Julie has taken appropriate measures to rectify some of the problems in her life. Her lack of stability and appropriate supports in the community are cause for concern and she will need professional assistance and resources. Julie will require close monitoring and ongoing treatments to provide her with the best chance possible of remaining substance free and achieving a reasonably stable level of mental health”. Ms Wakely, of course, was writing before the offender achieved the relative stability in the community that she now has.74 Despite discharging herself from the program at Kamira Farm, the Probation and Parole Officer feels that the offender “may benefit from further community based alcohol and other drugs treatment and psychological intervention”.75 Statements by the offender’s father and step-mother are before me. They indicate that she has been living with them since leaving Kamira and has commenced a more stable and functional lifestyle and, as far as they are aware, has remained abstinent from drugs. They describe her as having “turned the corner” and have confidence in her resolve to remain drug free, although acknowledging that there is a need for her to pursue counselling in relation to her underlying psychological issues.76 There is some indication that the offender is remorseful in that she initiated contact with the police and admitted her involvement. The Probation and Parole Officer reports that she, “Appears to accept responsibility for the offence and displayed insight into her offending behaviour”. In her evidence before me she was asked about the impact of the offences upon the golf club and she said, “I’m really sorry for my part in it”. None of this involves an acknowledgement of the loss and damage caused by her actions and she has not made, or offered to make, reparation for such loss and damage. Given the terms of s.21A(3)(i), I cannot therefore find that she is remorseful. 77 Having said that, however, I am satisfied that she has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. Her rehabilitation to date and her motivation to continue in this strongly supports such findings. The reports indicate that she will need further treatment and monitoring but I am satisfied that she is amenable to this. 78 I am satisfied that there is a link between the offender’s involvement in the offences and her drug use and that her drug use had its origins in events in her teenage years over which she had little or no control. Accordingly, I am satisfied that the link between drug abuse and the offences is something I should take into account as a relevant subjective circumstance as indicated by Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [273](c)(ii) and (iii).79 Ms Robinson submitted that her client was not an appropriate vehicle for general deterrence because of her diagnosis of depression and her long standing mental health instability. I do not accept that submission because I am not satisfied that an appropriate link has between established between those issues and her commission of the offences. In short, I am satisfied of the drug link but not the mental health link.80 The offender McGregor has been assessed as unsuitable for community service or periodic detention because of an inability to demonstrate her stability in the community. However, it is a matter for me to determine whether such sentencing options are appropriate, whilst having regard to the assessment made by the Probation and Parole Officer.81 The offender entered her pleas of guilty in the Local Court on 4 March 2008. If I was to sentence her to imprisonment I would discount the sentences I would otherwise have imposed upon her by 25%. The offender’s co-operation with authorities in providing a voluntary disclosure of guilt is a relevant matter in this context.82 The offender McGregor was in custody for 1 day, having been arrested on 17 October and released on bail on 18 October 2007. I will take this into account.83 Ms Robinson submitted that it was appropriate that her client be sentenced to imprisonment but she also submitted that it would be appropriate to suspend the sentence pursuant to s.12 Sentencing Procedure Act.Objective seriousness of the offences and roles played by each offender84 Having just dealt with the subjective features of each of the offenders, there is a useful reminder in the written submissions on behalf of the offender McGregor of the often quoted passage in the judgment of Gleeson CJ, Lee CJ at CL and Hunt J in Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349 at 354: 
     
      
      “… it is always important in seeking to determine the sentence appropriate to a particular crime to have regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively, for without this assessment the other factors requiring consideration in order to arrive at the proper sentence to be imposed cannot properly be given their place”.  
      
    85 The judgment goes on to state that the relative importance of the objective facts and the subjective features of a case will vary but even so, there is sometimes a risk that attention to persuasive subjective considerations may cause inadequate weight to be given to the objective circumstances of the case. 86 In R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566, Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        [15] It is authoritatively established that the common law principle of proportionality requires that a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the gravity of the crime, having regard to the objective circumstances. (T)he proportionality principle is also held to apply so that a sentence should not be less than the objective gravity of the offence requires. (Reference to authorities omitted). 
        
       
      
    87 As far as an offence of breaking, entering and committing a serious indictable offence is concerned, this matter is one of considerable seriousness. It involved two offenders actually involved with the physical execution of the crime, supported by another two offenders. I hasten to add, however, that I must ignore the fact that it was committed “in company” because that is a circumstance of aggravation that for some unknown reason the Crown has not charged. There is a degree of artificiality in that. 88 There was obviously more than passing thought given to the manner in which the offence would be committed. There must have been a plan as to how to gain entry to the club, when to do so, and then how to gain entry to the safe. It involved Ms Richardson contributing to the plan by advising her co-offenders that the hole in the roof of the club created when the first offence was committed had remained unrepaired. As to safe, the Agreed Facts are curiously silent as to how the money was taken from it. The document merely says that the safe was “accessed”. There are three possibilities – one that it was broken into using some type of equipment that was taken for the purpose; another that it was left open; and yet another, that it was opened with the use of the key and the combination. If it was either of the latter two possibilities, then the involvement of Ms Richardson is indicated. However, as I said earlier, I am dealing with this matter on the basis of the Agreed Facts and nothing else. I have been asked not to concern myself with the truth of the matter. Consequently I must put aside any consideration of how the money was taken from the safe, except that by whatever means it was taken, it must have been the subject of planning. Despite submissions to the contrary, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this was planned and organised criminal activity that went beyond the minimum that is inherent in an offence against s.112(1). 89 I am similarly satisfied that the loss occasioned by the offence was substantial. In excess of $25,000 in cash was taken. It was submitted by Mr Allen on behalf of the offender Spice that the financial loss, whilst significant, was not greater or more serious than normally contemplated. He referred me to R v Youkhana [2004] NSWCCA 412. I do not accept that submission. It was also submitted that because an offence against s.112(1) where the proceeds do not exceed $15,000 can be dealt with in the Local Court, $25,000 should be regarded as being in the lower end of the range for offences dealt with in this Court. I am not confined in my consideration of the seriousness of this offence to those that are dealt with in this Court. I am looking generally at offences against s.112(1). Despite these submissions I remain of the view that the value of the loss is more serious than would usually be encountered in offences of this type. 90 I do bear in mind in my assessment of objective seriousness that these were offences committed in commercial as opposed to private premises, the latter generally being regarded as more serious.91 Another matter to bear in mind in relation to this offence is that it was a repeated incursion into the same premises, one of the factors said to enhance the seriousness of such an offence: see R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327.92 In assessing the seriousness of the first offence, I am satisfied that it too was planned criminal activity. Rather than accessing a hole in the roof that was already there, on this occasion there must have been a plan as to how to effect the break in. Presumably some tools or equipment would have been necessary. There is no evidence before me as to the cost of rectifying the damage that was caused but creating a hole in the roof to gain entry obviously amounted to significant damage and it would undoubtedly have put the club, or its insurers, to expense.93 Before turning to the roles played by each offender, and just looking at the objective seriousness of the offences overall, I am satisfied that each is in the middle of the range.94 In some of the submissions on this topic there was reference to features which were absent, such as there being no-one present in the premises, and there being no injury or violence. Care is needed in relation to such matters because I am assessing the seriousness of offences against s.113(1) and s.112(1) and not such offences committed in circumstances of aggravation.95 As I indicated earlier, I am largely limited to the Agreed Facts in determining the roles played by each of the offenders. Spice and Thompson must be regarded as equally culpable for the events at and within the club – the break in to the premises and, in relation to the second offence, the theft of the money from the safe. The Agreed Facts indicate that Spice told police that in relation to both offences he waited outside as a lookout but without my being able to have recourse to the oral evidence on that topic I am not prepared to accept the truth of that claim. 96 In relation to the offender McGregor, her role was a lesser one than the two male offenders in that she acted as the driver and was not actively involved in the events at the club. 97 In Richardson’s case it is necessary to have recourse to the oral evidence because the Agreed Facts are deficient in describing her involvement. For the first offence she has pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact. The maximum penalty for that is considerably less than the penalty faced by her co-offenders. Her culpability lies in responding to a phone call from Spice and going to pick him up and take him away from the scene, knowing that he had been involved in an attempt to steal money from the golf club. She was aware that damage had been caused to the ceiling and she passed on to the co-offenders that this damage remained unrepaired, knowing that they would use this information in committing the second offence. She shared in the proceeds. Whilst Ms Richardson’s role was less active than McGregor’s, the breach of trust involved in passing on information to her co-offenders at the expense of her employer is a countervailing matter. I would assess the roles of the two women in the second offence as about equal. Comparative cases98 Ms Robinson, on behalf of the offender McGregor, referred me to a number of appellate decisions concerning sentences for s.112(1) offences and also, as did the Crown, to statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission. Appropriately, Ms Robinson conceded that the statistics must be viewed with caution. I do not regard the cases, or the statistics, as establishing any particular pattern or range of sentencing that is relevant to the case at hand. They are of use, but only minimally. I do note, however, that the statistics indicate that the vast majority of offenders dealt with in this Court for an offence against s.112(1) receive a full-time custodial sentence.General sentence considerations99 I have earlier referred to the need for a sentence to bear an appropriate relationship to the objective seriousness of the offence. General deterrence is an allied consideration. Again, I find a useful reminder of this in the written submissions on behalf of the offender McGregor with reference to the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Gordon (1994) 71 A Crim R 459 at 468: 
     
      
      “Except in well-defined circumstances such as the youth or the mental incapacity of the offender, public deterrence is generally regarded as the main purpose of punishment, and the subjective considerations relating to the particular offender (however persuasive) are necessarily subsidiary to the duty of the courts to see that the sentence which is imposed will operate as a powerful factor in preventing the commission of similar crimes by those who may otherwise be tempted by the prospect that only light punishment will be imposed. Retribution, or the taking of vengeance for the injury which was done by the offender, is also an important aspect of sentencing. Not only must the community be satisfied that the offender is given his just deserts, it is important as well that the victim, or those who are left behind, also feel that justice has been done. 
      
     
     
      
      What all of those principles make clear is that rehabilitation (or reform) – the hope that the offender will be released back into the community a better person than when he or she left it – is only one of the purposes of punishment and that, even when some measure of rehabilitation has been achieved, such a subjective consideration remains necessarily subsidiary to the need for the sentence to act as a deterrent to the public”. 
      
    100 Reference should also be made to s.3A Sentencing Procedure Act: 
     
      
      “The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows:  
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (a) to ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (b) to prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (c) to protect the community from the offender, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (d) to promote the rehabilitation of the offender, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (e) to make the offender accountable for his or her actions, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (f) to denounce the conduct of the offender, 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (g) to recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community.” 
        
       
      
    101 As was pointed out in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 476, these purposes overlap and sometimes conflict. It is a matter of achieving the appropriate balance, all the while bearing in mind the principles espoused in authorities such as those I have specifically referred to - Dodd, McNaughton and Gordon.102 Having regard to the seriousness of the offences as I have found, even in the cases of those offenders who I have found played a lesser role, I am satisfied that no sentence other than imprisonment is appropriate.103 In relation to the offenders Spice and Thompson, because of the principal role they each played in the commission of the offences I am satisfied that sentences to be served by anything other than full-time imprisonment would not be an appropriate reflection of the objective gravity of the offences, notwithstanding the significant subjective features that have been highlighted in their respective cases. 104 In relation to the offenders Richardson and McGregor, it is primarily because of the significantly lesser role they each played, in addition to their most favourable subjective cases, that I am going to order that the sentences be other than full time custodial ones. In relation to Ms McGregor, I have had regard to the assessment by the Probation and Parole Officer. However, I am satisfied of each of the matters listed in s.66 Sentencing Procedure Act. 105 Submissions were made that I should have regard to the fact that the s.113(1) offence is one that could have been dealt with in the Local Court. Obviously it was not because of the necessity to commit the offenders to this Court for sentence in respect of the s.112(1) offence. Nevertheless, it is something I have borne in mind as, in accordance with Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, I must determine sentences that are appropriate for the individual offences.106 Having done so, I must then consider questions of concurrency or accumulation of sentences and the principle of totality. In this regard, I take into account the relationship between the two offences, the second being virtually a continuation of the criminal activity or plan that was commenced with the first. The fact that there were two break ins to the premises rather than one means there is additional criminality that warrants some additional degree of punishment. However, the degree of accumulation I propose will be modest. 107 Where I am imposing full-time custodial sentences they will be back-dated to reflect periods of pre-sentence custody. 108 There are special circumstances in each case for reducing the proportion of the sentence represented by the non-parole period. These are that it is the offender’s first experience of imprisonment and that they should be given a greater period in the community on parole to further their rehabilitation. There is also the fact that there will be a degree of accumulation of sentences that I have just mentioned.

    JUDGMENT 1. As the conduct of criminals has become more and more sophisticated, secretive, and menacingly effective in avoiding detection, governments, both State and Commonwealth, have established investigative commissions with their wide range of powers including powers to coerce persons to divulge under oath what they know about facts, circumstances and persons that may be linked to criminal activity. The New South Wales Crime Commission, ICAC, the New South Wales Police Integrity Commission and the Australian Crime Commission are all examples of investigative bodies using investigative powers given to them by government. 2. Justice Badgery-Parker, speaking about ICAC, made observations that would apply equally to the Australian Crime Commission and its approach to the investigation of crime. 
     
      
      “The will of the community which led to, and is manifested by, the enactment of the ICAC Act is that corruption should be eradicated from the community and that this means to produce that result should include the coercive and inquisitorial powers conferred on ICAC by statute”; ( 
      R v Aristodemou 
       unreported, NSWCCA 30/6/1994)  
       
      
    3. Gwan Hong Kim, between 5 and 7 March 2008 at Sydney, gave evidence before an examiner at the Australian Crime Commission (ACC) that he knew to be false in a material particular when the examiner was seeking to question him about his knowledge and involvement in the circumstances concerning the importation of a container to a company of which he was director and sole shareholder that had entered Australia from South Korea on 25 January 2008. 4. The interest of the ACC had been triggered because, secreted within the container were seventeen cardboard boxes containing 356.2 kilograms of a border controlled precursor, pseudoephedrine. Pseudoephedrine is, of course, a precursor to amphetamine based drugs. The importation into Australia of such a large quantity of border-controlled precursor is a highly serious offence against the laws of the Commonwealth of Australia. 5. It appears the Australian Customs Service became aware of the border control precursor by 29 January 2008. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) took up their investigations on 30 January 2008. Police inquiries were able to backtrack this offender’s activities to about 23 November 2007 when he sought assistance in registering a company on his behalf. That was the company that imported the container. Police also established an interest he had in leasing a warehouse as early as 27 November 2007. Police established as early as the 3 December 2007, the offender was indicating he was expecting a container and sought assistance unloading the container with a forklift and storing it in the warehouse he had leased. Police were able to establish monies ($5,064) had been paid for the consignment of a twenty-foot shipping container including freight and delivery charges.6. On 4 February, an associate of the offender informed him of police inquiries. It seems the container had not been cleared by Customs at that date. On 12 February, the offender made inquiries of his own customs broker as to where the consignment was. At this time, he was in the company of two males, one an Australian, the other an Asian. Those males have not been identified.7. By 29 February, the offender had organised to meet the person who had earlier informed him of police interest in the container. That meeting was set for 3 March. On 3 March AFP intercepted this offender on his way to a meeting with his customs manager and the other gentleman. He was then detained under the Migration Act as an unlawful non-citizen. The offender could have been in little doubt that police were making inquiries in respect of the container. 8. A month before he was detained, they had issued a search warrant on the leased warehouse premises and seized a number of documents relating to the trans-shipment of the container and his customs manager’s details. If he was not concerned when his friend or associates told him police were investigating, he certainly may well have become so after the execution of the search warrant. 9. Between 5 and 7 March, the offender was summonsed to an examination conducted before an examiner at the Australian Crime Commission (ACC). On several occasions when giving evidence, he indicated that he did not know or could not remember items in circumstances that clearly demonstrated he was obfuscating and blocking the examiner’s inquiries. Further, the answers he was giving were deliberately untruthful. 10. The indictment contains four particulars of the false evidence and they suffice for the purposes of defining the criminal acts that I am dealing with. 
     
      
      (1) The offender said that he did not know or could not remember the arrangements he had made to import a container of goods consigned to the Korea Food Importers Pty Ltd that had entered Australia from South Korea on or about 25 January 2008.  
       
       
      (2) He gave evidence that he did not know or was unable to identify other persons involved with him in the establishment of a company named Korea Food Importers Pty Ltd. 
       
       
      (3) He gave evidence that he did not know anything about the arrangements made in connection with his attendance in company with two unidentified male persons at the office of Rohde and Liesenfeld Pty Ltd on 12 February 2008.  
       
       
      (4) And finally, that he did not know or could not remember any residential address at which he lived between the date of his first arrival in 1987 and the date of his detention on 3 March 2008. 
      
    Objective Criminality 11. From the facts as he finds them to be, a sentencing Judge must assess the objective criminality of an offence before the court. That is done by comparing, objectively, the criminality of this offence with offences of similar kinds that have come before courts in the past. The objective criminality plays a crucial part in determining the final sentencing disposition. Offences of giving evidence that is knowingly false or misleading to an examiner of the Australian Crime Commission do not frequently come before the courts. 12. In submissions, I was given a list by the Commonwealth DPP of fifteen cases on an Australia wide basis, dealt with in various jurisdictions and, I note, not all of them were ACC cases. I will attach to these remarks the comparative sentences summary given to me.13. For this reason, it is worthwhile to analyse with some care the nature of criminality arising from this offender’s conduct. In a normal interaction with others in the community, knowingly giving false or misleading information is not usually regarded as criminal conduct. It may well go to a person’s reputation for trustworthiness. It may well constitute reprehensible or even cruel behaviour. But in such cases as this, it is regarded as criminal conduct attracting a maximum penalty of five years. 14. There is a clear reason, why the false evidence given by this accused amounts to criminal conduct by him. He was before a statutorily constituted commission of the Australian government. To that commission, he gave a solemn promise that he would “tell the truth, the whole truth”. The false evidence he gave was a breach of this solemn promise. Section 33 of the Australian Crime Commission Act 2002 mandates that such conduct is criminal conduct. In other words, the law deemed that conduct criminal.15. The measure of the objective criminality arising from the conduct will be found in the number of occasions false evidence was given; the number of separate issues covered by the false evidence; the nature of the false evidence given; the degree of malice motivating the decision to give the false evidence; the impact the false evidence has upon the Australian Crime Commission; and related to this last, the number of persons who benefited from the false evidence given.16. In respect of this offender, the particulars in the indictment make clear and the evidence supports that four areas in which the offender gave false evidence. I have earlier referred to them. They relate to, 
     
      
      (1) Initial arrangements made to import the container. 
       
       
      (2) The identity of other persons involved in the enterprise. 
       
       
      (3) The explanation for his being accompanied by two unidentified males when making inquiries about the fate of the container on 12 February 2008. 
       
       
      (4) His residential address at the time he made arrangements to import the container and when he was seeking to claim the container from Customs. 
       
      
    It will be seen that the issues covered by the areas in which false evidence were given relate to the initiation of what turned out to be a serious criminal enterprise against the law of the Commonwealth; the identity of persons who may have been involved in or could give authorities assistance in investigating this serious criminal enterprise; the identity of persons who may have benefited from and/or committed further criminal offences arising from the importation of border control precursors; and access to a site at which there may have been documents or other hard physical evidence that may, in turn, have given insight into the methodology of mechanics used and personnel associated with illegal importation of border control precursors.17. The nature of the false evidence given in this case was the offender’s claimed inability to remember. For example, 
     
      
      “Q. Where were you living before you went into detention? 
       
      A. I don’t know. 
       
       
      Q. You just went into detention a few days ago? 
       
      A. I don’t know.” 
       
      
    Or, these questions; 
     
      
      “Q. Did you make arrangements for a container to be shipped to Australia...for your company...? 
       
      A. I don’t know. 
       
       
      Q. What do you know about the container? 
       
      A. I can’t think of anything at the moment.” 
       
      
    While these answers constitute false evidence, in fairness, it should be noted they are not concocted falsehoods providing created information as to dates, names, places, vehicles and circumstances requiring investigators to establish their falsehood. As soon as each of the answers given by this offender were given, its falsehood was immediately apparent.The Impact of the False Evidence Upon the Account18. The first direct impact of the offender’s conduct is that it frustrated the examiner conducting the inquiry. He was pursuing an investigation relating to a Federal criminal activity. As earlier noted, that criminal activity was the unlawful importing of 356 kilos of border controlled precursor. The examiner is one of the visible faces of the ACC as it pursues it functions. These include: 
     
      
      (a) To collect, correlate, analyse and disseminate criminal information and intelligence and to maintain a national database of information and intelligence. 
       
       
      (b) To undertake, when authorised by the Board, intelligence operations.  
       
       
      (c) To investigate matters relating to Federally relevant criminal activity. 
       
       
      (d) To provide reports on outcomes of operations and investigations. 
       
       
      (e) To provide strategic criminal intelligence assessments and any other criminal information and intelligence to its Board. To provide advice to the Board on national criminal intelligence priorities. 
       
      
    The Board of the ACC, itself, has a series of functions including recommending to Parliament law reforms and other matters that may assist in the better detection and pursuit of criminals. 19. When an examiner is frustrated in his or her investigation, the ACC’s functions are thereby compromised. Its capacity to investigate crime, gather intelligence, provide reports and recommend law reform to governments are also diminished. The stunning example is this case of the 356 illegally imported kilos of pseudoephedrine. It would seem from the material before me that no prosecution has been launched in respect of this very serious offence. No intelligence has been gained into the way in which the offence was committed. None of those responsible for the offending have been adequately investigated. A serious crime targeted at undermining the public health of Australian citizens has gone unsolved. 20. There was evidence in this matter from Federal Agent Kennedy as to lost assistance following to the AFP in its own investigation in respect of identities of potential suspects, addresses, vehicles. While I have no doubt that loss was real, it is not a matter appropriate to be considered in this sentencing. It may well be a result of frustrating the work of the ACC. However, the criminality of this offence relates solely to matters earlier identified. Impact upon the AFP investigations do not aggravate the criminality I am dealing with.21. This is not an offence against the courts or curial system; (R v Einfeld [2008] NSWCCA 215). The ACC is not a curial institution. Its function is not to administer justice. Its functions are defined clearly in s 7C of the Australian Crimes Commission Act of 2002. I have already made reference to them. They concern investigating, storing information, providing intelligence assessments, making recommendations on law reforms. None of these are judicial functions. The acts of the offender hindered an investigation, which may, but not necessarily would have, brought offenders before the court. It would be pure speculation as to whether the administration of justice is compromised by his acts.22. I note the misleading information was given in circumstances where the offender had been granted immunity and had been warned of the consequence of giving false information. His false answers were given deliberately, defiantly, and with the intent to protect another or, more likely, others. I am unable to say the number of persons who benefited from his deception. Clearly, there was some involvement of persons in South Korea who loaded the precursors into the container. Some, who were involved in hiding these precursors into salt packets or whatever that were ultimately packed in cartons, and some who initially supplied the precursors to those in South Korea. 23. There were also other persons to be involved in the distribution once the product arrived in Australia and, indeed, into its transformation from pseudoephedrine into amphetamine or, at least, on the way to obtaining amphetamine, more correctly. There may well have been persons involved in financing the venture. Investigators were unable to assess whether this was a one-off venture or one of a series. While I cannot say with precision who benefited from the offender’s non-cooperation with examiner, I am satisfied more persons were involved in this venture than himself.24. I am also satisfied the commission was denied any opportunity of forwarding information to the relevant investigators as a consequence of this offender’s non-cooperation. I can see no mitigation to the objective seriousness of this offence. There is no suggestion of any danger to the offender, his loved ones, or his property had he given the information sought by the examiners.25. Clearly, the detection and investigation of crime is a fundamental requirement for bringing criminals to justice. Clearly, the Australian Government set up the ACC to use coercive powers to facilitate investigation of crime in difficult cases. Instruction of this detection and investigative process in circumstances where a government has given special powers to examiners constitutes a serious flouting of the laws established for that purpose. I am satisfied the objective seriousness is such as to require imprisonment for this offence.Subjective Matters26. I turn to the subjective matters. They are matters personal to this offender. Not only am I sentencing for this offence but I am sentencing this offender for it. Matters personal to the offender may throw some light or insight into why it was he committed this offence or why a more or a less serious sentencing outcome is appropriate in this case.27. Kim was born in December 1962. He was, on my calculation, 44 at the time of offending and he is 45, soon to be 46 at the time of sentencing. He was born in Seoul, South Korea. He had a normally happy childhood. He has one elder and one younger brother. His father passed away in 1983. He is a single man. He had a one-year relationship with a girlfriend in Sydney. He has friends in the Sydney Korean community. It is likely his elderly mother has passed away in recent times but he is unsure because as a consequence of his incarceration he has been unable to contact his brother. He came to Australia in 1987. He has visited from time to time his homeland. Education, Skills and Employment 28. He completed his schooling in South Korea. He performed well academically and in sport whilst at school. He sought post-secondary education at a South Korean military college but, regrettably, failed, most likely because of difficulty with the subject of mathematics. He completed military service, however, in Korea in 1986. His main income stream from work in Australia came from cleaning and labouring jobs. He worked for one of his brothers when he returned to Korea, however, in a time of financial circumstances in South Korea that business failed. The offender claims the loss amounted to more than a million dollars. There may well be some link between that loss and the importation of 356 kilograms of pseudoephedrine. On the other hand, where I sit at the moment, it is purely speculative. 29. He has visited Korea since 2003. He claims at the time of his arrest, he was setting up a grocery importing business between South Korea and Australia. That claim must now be questionable given the contraband found in the container that was the subject of the AFP inquiries. Physical Health30. He reports good physical health. There seems little in his physical health that could impact upon his rehabilitation prospects. He says he does need dental work but, apparently, his need is not an urgent one because he is waiting until he is finally released from custody for that to occur.Substance Abuse and Gambling31. The offender is a social smoker. He is not a drug user. He enjoys social gambling such as card games, however, on occasions he has spent up to $500 on poker machines. There is no suggestion that his gambling or substance issues contributed to his criminality. Mental Health Issues32. He appears to be of normal intelligence. He does not suffer any inherent cognitive impairments. He does, however, experience anxiety. When stressed by relationship problems in 2003 when, as I understand it, his girlfriend left him, he appears to have overdosed (whether deliberately or not is unclear) on sedative medication.Attitude to Offence33. He appears to be without remorse in respect of his offending conduct. I doubt he has any real insight into why his conduct is criminal. He may understand, and hopefully he does, it is morally wrong to be untruthful but there is a difference between moral wrong and criminal conduct. 34. He entered his plea to this matter on the day it was set for trial. I’m right on that aren’t I Madam Crown?MARINOS: Yes, however it was indicated to the Crown about a week and a bit before that there was a plea offer.HIS HONOUR: The administration of justice was thereby served and he should receive a benefit by virtue of that fact. I suspect the personal deterrence that the sentence would have upon this offender is not great. I will put that another way. If he were taken to the ACC tomorrow, I am far from convinced his conduct would differ much, if at all, from what it was on the 5 and 7 March.35. The sentence I am imposing is one of imprisonment and a requirement that he be of good behaviour pursuant to a bond, I intend to give. I have compared the sentence I have imposed to others given to other offenders guilty of similar offences. I am satisfied the sentence to be imposed adequately punishes this offender.36. As to his rehabilitation prospects, frankly, I am unable to prognosticate. From previous experience I am aware that imprisonment brings far greater and more profound sense of shame within a South Korean family than is the case here in Australia. Hopefully, the shame he has brought upon himself and his family will motivate him to lawful behaviour in the future. 37. So far as can be discerned, apart from himself, there is no other person directly affected by his incarceration. I have mentioned his brothers in Korea, but what they know of his predicament is not disclosed in evidence. Indeed, because of the shame, it may well be he has kept this information from them entirely.38. Mr Kim, would you stand up please. Gwan Hong Kim, you are convicted of the offence that you, between 5 and 7 March 2008 at Sydney at an examination conducted before an examiner did give evidence that to your knowledge was false in a material particular, namely, on the topic of your knowledge about and your involvement in the circumstances connected with the importation of a container consigned to Korea Food Importers Pty Ltd, a company of which you were a director and sole shareholder. I note that that container entered Australia from South Korea on or about 25 January 2008.39. For that offence, you are sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment to date from 25 March 2008. 40. I order your release pursuant to a recognizance release order after you have served eight months imprisonment. I order you to be released on 24 November 2008 pursuant to that recognizance release order.41. The balance of your sentence will be one year ten months to expire on 25 September 2010. I order you to enter into a recognizance under s 20 of the Crimes Act 1914.

      2008/10781 R v TROYE JARROD MILLER 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 4 December 2007 Troye Jarrod Miller was charged with the murder of his father, Stephen James Miller. The charge was laid after he voluntarily presented at the Culcairn Police Station and admitted to having killed his father the previous day. 
     
      
    2 On 31 October 2008 he was arraigned before me and pleaded not guilty to the murder. It was common ground that the plea was entered on the grounds of mental illness as provided for in s 22 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (the “Mental Health Act”). 
     
      
    3 On 5 September 2008, with the consent of the Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Miller’s trial was set down without a jury pursuant to s 132 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 4 The sole issue for determination in the trial before me was whether I was satisfied that Mr Miller should be acquitted of murder on the grounds of mental illness pursuant to the provisions of s 38 of the Mental Health Act.  
     
      
    5 No oral evidence was called at the trial by either the Crown or Mr Miller. By consent, and without objection, their respective cases were presented by the joint tender of a number of statements prepared by investigating police, including an agreed statement of facts, a report by Dr Olav Nielssen, forensic psychiatrist, dated 13 May 2008, obtained by the representatives of the accused, and a report by Professor Greenberg, dated 27 June 2008, obtained by the Crown.  
     
      
    6 The reports reflected a uniformity of opinion that when Mr Miller murdered his father he was suffering from a mental illness that deprived him of the capacity to consider the moral or legal consequences of his behaviour. 
     
      
    7 Accordingly, as provided for by s 38 of the Mental Health Act, I found Mr Miller not guilty of the murder of Stephen James Miller by reason of mental illness and ordered his continued detention at the Metropolitan Reception and Remand Centre (MRRC) or such other place as he may be detained in accordance with Part 5 Division B of the Mental Health Act, until released by due process of law. Pursuant to s 39(3) of the Act I directed that the Registrar of this Court inform the Minister for Health and the Mental Health Tribunal of the terms of this order. 
     
      
    8 After delivering the verdict of not guilty, I indicated that I would publish reasons in support of that finding. The balance of this judgment constitutes those reasons.  
     
      
    The events of 3 December 2007 
     
      
    9 According to the agreed statement of facts, prior to the events which resulted in the deceased’s death, 3 December 2007 was an otherwise ordinary day in the lives of the Miller family. Mr Miller spent the day on the computer in a shed which was located at the back of his parent’s home at Culcairn while his parents busied themselves in the house. On numerous occasions he came into the house. This was not unusual. Later in the afternoon Mrs Miller prepared some dinner after which she retired to have a sleep. The deceased was watching the television. Mr Miller came out of the shed and into the house around 9pm and ate his dinner alone in the kitchen while his parents watched television. The deceased asked Mr Miller, “How’s the dinner mate?” to which he replied “Bloody delicious dad”. Mrs Miller then asked her son if he wanted anything else to eat. He indicated that he would come in later when his parents were ready to eat their evening meal. He did not join them. Apparently they saw nothing unusual in this. After having their dinner Mrs Miller and the deceased resumed watching television. 
     
      
    10 Around 11pm the hall door opened suddenly to reveal Mr Miller holding a sledge hammer in his right hand and a knife in his left hand. Taken somewhat by surprise, his mother asked whether he needed to borrow some of his father’s tools. Mr Miller did not reply. Mrs Miller described her son as having black rings around his eyes and blankness about his face. It would appear that she did not notice anything unusual about her son’s appearance earlier in the day. Mr Miller then lifted up the hammer and held the knife out in front of himself. He walked to the deceased who was seated in an armchair and said, “You’re the demon, you’re the devil, you’ve got to die”. He then swung the hammer and hit the deceased across the head and repeatedly stabbed him with the knife. Mrs Miller tried to stop her son but he pushed her away and continued stabbing the deceased. He said “…we have to get out of here they’re after us, we’ve got to get out of here, we’re not safe”. Mr Miller then stabbed the deceased again, after which he put his hand on his mother’s shoulder and said “Mum I’d never hurt you”. He then stabbed the deceased again. Mr Miller then appealed to his mother asking what they should do. She replied “Run, just run away”. Mr Miller then left the house via the front door. 
     
      
    11 Mrs Miller called the police and the ambulance. Attending ambulance officers noted the stab wounds to the body, a large laceration to the right side of the deceased’s throat and the absence of respiration or pulse. The deceased was pronounced dead. The cause of death was found to be multiple stab wounds. 
     
      
    12 According to the account Mr Miller gave to Professor Greenberg during his interview on 21 June 2008, after killing his father he left his parents’ home and ran away. At some point he dropped the knife. As daylight was approaching Mr Miller said that he saw a cloud in the shape of a hand which was pointing to Culcairn. He took this as a sign that he should return to Culcairn. Apparently he went directly to the Culcairn Police Station from where he telephoned Albury police and informed them that he wanted to surrender himself. Mr Miller told interviewing police at Albury that his father was a demon, and that he attacked him using a hammer and a small kitchen knife. When asked what he was thinking at the time of the attack, Mr Miller replied “That he was a demon”.  
     
      
    Mr Miller’s subjective circumstances 
     
      
    13 Mrs Miller stated that her son had a normal childhood until he was sent to Chevalier College, a boarding school at Bowral, when he was 15. According to her statement to police, it was at this time that a lot of her son’s problems started. Mrs Miller received letters from the school that her son was smoking cigarettes. At around the same time it was revealed to her that one of the teachers was accused of molesting students in Mr Miller’s dormitory. A few weeks later one of the boarders hanged himself. He was found by Mr Miller and some other students. Mrs Miller and the deceased were not informed of these events, nor of the fact that their son subsequently ran away from school and stayed with some friends in Cabramatta. Mrs Miller believes that it was at this time that her son began using drugs. When he was eventually located by his parents Mr Miller refused to return home for two or three weeks. After his return, he was using drugs regularly, experimenting with various illicit substances and consuming cannabis on a daily basis.  
     
      
    14 Mr Miller is currently 33 years of age and was aged 32 at the time of the killing. He married in 1998 but separated from his wife in 2003. They had no children. Since leaving school Mr Miller worked intermittently in a range of semi-skilled positions the longest of which, on his own estimate, lasted 18 months.  
     
      
    Mr Miller’s mental health 
     
      
    15 Issues relating to Mr Miller’s mental health first surfaced in September 2003 when he was involuntarily admitted to Glenside Psychiatric Hospital in South Australia by his wife and father-in-law. They had become concerned about his bizarre behaviour. This behaviour included talking in strange voices, claiming to be god and carrying a sword saying “I will kill them all”. He remained at Glenside for three weeks. Dr Dan Short, a consultant psychiatrist at Glenside, diagnosed Mr Miller with “a schizoaffective disorder with associated cannabis use and drug dependence”. 
     
      
    16 In the discharge summary dated 26 September 2003 Mr Miller’s manic behaviour was elaborated upon so as to include:  
     
      
       
        
        “…racing thoughts, increased energy and multiple grandiose delusions – genius IQ, able to defeat Grand Masters in Chess and martial arts, master level drummer.” 
        
       
      
    17 The discharge summary also noted that Mr Miller was an admitted self-harmer. It detailed an episode when he deliberately burnt his hands. The summary further noted that Mr Miller talked frequently of the id and the ego and his model of a perfect universe based on an unintelligible mathematical formula. 
     
      
    18 The documentation maintained at Glenside also noted that Mr Miller experienced auditory hallucinations. Although he first denied experiencing hallucinations, after several days he acknowledged to medical staff that he had been hearing the voices of ancient warriors over a period of years and that this terrified him. Mr Miller reported that one of the voices was negative and hated him, threatening to kill him and cut him apart. The other voice he heard was positive. He was convinced it was the voice of an angel. Finally he disclosed that when he burnt his hands the voices disappeared and he lost his fear of dying. 
     
      
    19 During his consultations with Dr Short, Mr Miller also admitted to experimenting with various illicit drugs and being a regular cannabis user. In Dr Short’s view, Mr Miller’s drug use was likely to have been triggered by bullying and physical punishment at the hands of school staff as well as the suicide of the friend he had found while he was a boarder.  
     
      
    20 Dr Short prescribed antipsychotic medication Olanzapine and Sodium valproate. Following his discharge from Glenside Mr Miller consulted a private psychiatrist in Adelaide and was prescribed the antipsychotic medication amisulpride (Solian). 
     
      
    21 At about this time Mr Miller and his wife separated and he returned to his parents’ home in Batemans Bay, New South Wales. Mr Miller moved with his parents from Batemans Bay to Culcairn eight months before the murder. He continued taking amisulpride daily and saw a mental health worker at the local community health centre intermittently. Mr Miller told Dr Nielssen that after his hospital admission he became “paranoid of psychiatrists” and refused to see a visiting psychiatrist for a review. Mr Miller was also referred by Centrelink to see Mr Hickey, a psychologist, however he told Professor Greenberg that during these visits he told Mr Hickey as little as possible because he was afraid that he may be admitted to a psychiatric facility. 
     
      
    22 Mr Miller reported to both Dr Nielssen and Professor Greenberg that he became increasingly irregular in taking his medication after leaving South Australia, and that he stopped taking it altogether around the time the family moved from Batemans Bay to Culcairn. 
     
      
    Psychiatric assessments for the purposes of trial 
     
      
    23 On 17 April 2008, Dr Nielssen interviewed Mr Miller at the request of his legal representatives with a view to preparing a psychiatric report and, in particular, seeking the doctor’s opinion as to whether or not Mr Miller was suffering from a disease of the mind at the time of the killing which caused a defect of reason such as to deprive him of an appreciation of the nature and quality of his act. 
     
      
    24 During the course of the interview with Dr Nielssen, Mr Miller stated that he started to believe that demons were trying to kill him. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I started to connect that they were fallen watchers or angels…I heard the voice of an angel who introduced himself as Gregory … they were watching me…judging me…I could hear them talking about me”. 
        
       
      
    Mr Miller also told Dr Nielssen of his belief that he was the reincarnation of Seth. I note that Seth is a character in the Book of Enoch, an ancient religious text. 
     
      
    25 Mr Miller also stated that in the years prior to killing his father he came to believe that his father was one of the angels. When asked if he had spoken to his father about his beliefs, Mr Miller told Dr Nielssen that shortly before 3 December 2007 he asked his father about his associations with angels which his father denied. Mr Miller claimed that he later heard his father admit that he was a demon. 
     
      
    26 According to his account to Dr Nielssen, on the night of the killing Mr Miller heard that angels were doing something to his computer which caused him to remove the hard drive. Once he had done this, he heard the angels getting angry and cocking their weapons causing him to believe that they were preparing to kill him and his mother.  
     
      
    27 At the conclusion of the assessment Dr Nielssen diagnosed Mr Miller with chronic schizophrenia and a substance abuse disorder which was in remission. Accordingly, Dr Nielssen found: 
     
      
       
        
        “…he was acutely mentally ill at the time of the offence and…has the defence of mental illness open to him. He had a disease of the mind in the form of schizophrenic illness that caused a defect of reason in the form of the delusion that his father was a demon and that he was in immediate danger of being attacked. At the time he did not appreciate the nature and quality of his act as he believed his father was a demon who was about to kill him and did not appreciate that his actions were wrong, as he believed that he was acting in self defence and to protect his mother.”  
        
       
      
    28 On 21 June 2008, Mr Miller was interviewed by Professor Greenberg at the request of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions. Professor Greenberg was also asked to determine whether or not Mr Miller was fit to be tried, and whether or not a defence of mental illness under the Mental Health Act was available to him.  
     
      
    29 Mr Miller gave Professor Greenberg virtually the same account of the killing and the events which preceded it as he had given to Dr Nielssen, namely, hearing voices, developing beliefs about angels and demons, and hearing cocked weapons of angry angels wanting to kill him and his mother. Mr Miller also told Professor Greenberg that immediately following the killing he was not afraid of the police but of the demons, and that because his mother would not leave the house he left and ran fearing for his life. 
     
      
    30 At the conclusion of the assessment Professor Greenberg diagnosed Mr Miller with schizoaffective disorder and polysubstance abuse/dependence. Professor Greenberg was also of the opinion that at the time of the killing Mr Miller was experiencing acute psychotic symptoms and suffered from a disease of the mind. Professor Greenberg concluded that at the time of the offence Mr Miller was suffering from a defect of reason and did not understand the nature and quality of his actions such that the defence of mental illness was available to him. Neither Professor Greenberg nor Dr Nielssen considered Mr Miller to be unfit to be tried.  
     
      
    31 Mr Miller reported to Dr Nielssen that he still heard voices from time to time but not with the same intensity as around the time of the offence. He said he suffered from anxiety and intrusive memories of killing his father. When interviewed by Professor Greenberg Mr Miller denied having any continuing auditory or visual hallucinations. 
     
      
    32 Both Dr Nielssen and Professor Greenberg agreed that Mr Miller has responded to the antipsychotic and antidepressant medications which have been prescribed to him since his admission into the Mental Health area of the MRRC, but that he will require long term treatment and close supervision over an extended period of time. Professor Greenberg noted: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Miller suffers from a chronic psychotic illness, namely a Schizoaffective Disorder. He will require ongoing psychiatric treatment and management care for many decades and probably for the rest of his life. He is currently taking antipsychotic and antidepressant medication. He is currently compliant with such treatment and currently has no acute psychotic symptoms. He will require a comprehensive risk assessment and management plan and monitoring of his psychotic illness over an extended period of time.” 
        
       
      
    Conclusion  
     
      
    33 Were Mr Miller to have been responsible as a matter of law for his conduct on the night of 3 December 2007 he would have been punished as a criminal offender. However, because of his mental state at the time he murdered his father, and because in our system of justice only the mentally sound are punished, he will, instead, be subject to the control of a tribunal constituted under the Mental Health Act, a statutory body that is charged with the task of seeking to achieve a balance between an individual’s right to treatment, protection and care when they suffer from mental illness, and the interests and rights of the community to safety and protection.  
     
      
    34 In the special facts of this case I am satisfied that justice has been done under the law by the orders I have made.

     Judgment 
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    2 NETTLE AJA: After a trial before her Honour Judge Morgan and a jury of twelve, on 28 April 2006 the applicants, Adam Peacock and Brendan Peacock, were found guilty and convicted of one count of wounding Shane Baker with intent to murder (s 27 Crimes Act 1900); one count of detaining Shane Baker without his consent with intent to obtain an advantage and occasioning him actual bodily harm (s 86 (3) Crimes Act 1900); and one count of detaining James Isgro without his consent with intent to obtain an advantage (s 86 (2) (a) Crimes Act 1900).  
     
      
    3 On 6 October 2006, each applicant was sentenced in respect of those offences to a total term of imprisonment of 12 years to date from 11 April 2006 with a total non-parole period of 8 years to expire on 28 April 2014.  
     
      
    4 This is an application for leave to appeal against conviction out of time. The sole proposed ground of appeal is that a miscarriage of justice was caused by the failure of the Crown to call one Dale Biddle to give evidence at trial. 
     
      
    5 The Crown case at trial was that on Saturday 9 April 2005, each complainant went with the Peacocks to the Royal National Park after Brendan Peacock suggested that they take a crop of cannabis that was known to be growing there. When they stopped for a rest, Brendan Peacock punched Baker to the head, which caused him to fall to the ground and then pinned him to the ground and tied his hands with duct tape while he screamed at him to “confess”, “who robbed our house?” Simultaneously, Adam Peacock knocked James Isgro to the ground and bound his hands and feet with duct tape. When Baker denied that he had been involved in burgling the Peacock house, Brendan Peacock produced a knife and stabbed Baker in the hand and continued for some time to accuse him of having been the burglar. Baker, however, continued to deny it until Brendan Peacock said words to Baker to the effect of, “How do you want to die, I have a gun too?” At that point, Baker turned his head and saw that Brendan Peacock was holding what appeared to be a gold coloured pen gun, and a moment later he heard a loud bang and felt something warm enter the back of his head. He pretended to be dead. Adam Peacock then said, “He’s still breathing” and, in response to that, Brendan Peacock pulled back Baker’s head and using the knife slashed Baker’s throat a couple of times. After that, Brendan and Adam Peacock covered Baker with foliage and then left the area with James Isgro.  
     
      
    6 James Isgro believed that Baker had been shot and killed. He pleaded for his life and was told by Adam Peacock that, if he told anyone about what he happened, he would be blamed. Isgro thus accompanied the Peackocks back through the bush to the cars and then drove with them towards Beverly Hills. Shortly before they arrived in Edgbaston Street, Beverly Hills, they told him to get out and walk home, which he did, and they drove on the rest of the way to their home close by.  
     
      
    7 As Isgro walked towards his mother’s home, he threw the duct tape which had bound his hands into the back yard of a house he was passing, from which it was later recovered by police. After pausing to speak to a neighbour and accepting a drink, he returned to his home and made immediate complaint to his mother that Baker had been murdered by Brendan Peacock. Fearing what the applicants might do to him if he reported the matter to the police, Isgro and his mother travelled by train to Sutherland where they used a public telephone to make an anonymous complaint to the police. On Monday 11 April 2005, police visited Isgro’s home and at that point he made a statement.  
     
      
    8 Meanwhile, after waiting for some 15 minutes for the Peacocks and Isgro to leave the area, Baker extricated himself from where he had been left covered and walked out of the bush on to a fire trail. He there came across two bushwalkers who assisted him back to the Waterfall Station. He told the two bushwalkers and the station-master that he had been shot, although he did not tell them or, to begin with, the police the name of his attackers. His initial account to police was that he had accompanied two unidentified men into the bush to obtain some cannabis which they knew to be growing there. It was only later, after undergoing an operation to remove a .22 calibre bullet embedded in the back of his head, that he disclosed to police that the applicants were his assailants. But at that point he did not say anything of having been involved in the burglary of their home.  
     
      
    9 On the following Monday morning, the applicants were arrested and interviewed, but both denied any involvement and both raised alibis. Thus the matter proceeded to trial.  
     
      
    10 During a conference less than a week before the trial, Baker admitted to the Crown prosecutor for the first time that he had broken into the Peacock home. That fact was then disclosed to the defence and the matter was examined in the course of a Basha inquiry on 16 March 2006. During the inquiry, Baker said that he had burgled the Peacock’s home in company with a boy named “Dale” and, when the judge asked Dale’s surname, Baker said that it was “Biddle”. Thereafter, the facts of the burglary (there was no dispute that it had taken place on 28 December 2004) and the whereabouts of Biddle were the subject of some cross-examination on the inquiry. Baker said that Dale Biddle had been but was no longer a friend and that he believed but was not sure that he lived “somewhere around Campbelltown now”. He was also asked to spell “Biddle” and said that he assumed that it was spelt “B I T A L” but there was no further inquiry as to the identity or whereabouts of Biddle and the defence did not request the Crown to call Biddle or to make him available for cross-examination.  
     
      
    11 The Crown case at trial relied on the direct testimony of each of the complainants and their identification of the Peacocks; the motive of the Peacocks to visit vengeance for the burglary of their home on the man they believed to be the culprit; the evidence of the bushwalkers and station-master; evidence of the fact that Brendan Peacock had had a knife, bullets and gold and brass pen gun which he placed in a sports bag and handed to his girlfriend on 10 April 2005 to hold for him for safe keeping; and forensic and other circumstantial evidence which was consistent with motive and opportunity. Baker gave evidence at trial that the Peacocks had demanded to know, “Who robbed me?” and “confess, confess”. He said that, although he had in fact committed the burglary, he was terrified as to what the Peacocks would do if he admitted it and thus he had denied his involvement. Isgro stated that as the Peacocks had said, “You know who done it. We know you robbed our house… Just tell us now. Just admit to it”.  
     
      
       
      Ground of appeal 
       
      
    12 This application for leave to appeal out of time is premised on the fact that Biddle has recently made a statement in which he claims that he was not involved in the burglary. It also appears that, at the time of the trial, Biddle was released on bail in connection with another offence and thus reporting daily to police in accordance with the conditions of his bail. In that sense, his whereabouts were known to the Crown. In those circumstances, the applicants contend that a miscarriage of justice was caused by the failure of the Crown to call Biddle to give evidence at the trial and that leave to appeal out of time should be granted because the facts about Biddle have only recently come to light.  
     
      
    13 Counsel for the applicants argues in support of the application that the law places a high degree of responsibility on the Crown to ensure that the prosecution case is presented with fairness to the accused, and so to call all relevant witnesses, and, as part of that obligation, to refrain from electing not to call a material witness merely for tactical reasons. He refers in particular to the High Court’s statements of principle to that effect in Whitehorn v The Queen (1983) 152 CLR 657, in R v Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563 and to the statements of this court in R v Kneebone (1999) 47 NSWLR 450. In counsel’s submission, Biddle was a material witness because his testimony would have dented the weight to be attached to the evidence of the complainant and, therefore, the Crown was under an obligation to call Biddle or at least to conference with Biddle before concluding that he should not be called. It follows, in counsel’s submission, that inasmuch as the Crown did not have a good reason for failing to call Biddle, or at least, due to the absence of conference, is unable to identify a sufficiently good reason for failing to call him, it is apparent that there has been a miscarriage of justice which necessitates that a new trial be had.  
     
      
    14 The Crown resists the application. Counsel for the respondent argues that there was no obligation on the Crown to call Biddle in the circumstances of this case. He relies upon the circumstance that Baker’s involvement in the burglary was not known to the Crown until shortly before the trial and that, upon learning about his involvement in the burglary, the Crown immediately disclosed it to the defence. Reliance is also placed on the fact that Biddle’s involvement was not known to the Crown until it was disclosed in the course of the Basha inquiry, and hence that even then Biddle had not been interviewed or made a statement to police; and upon the fact that defence counsel did not ask that the Crown call Biddle or make him available for cross-examination or even to make any further inquiries as to his whereabouts. In counsel’s submission, this is not a case in which the Crown knew of the evidence which Biddle would or would be likely to give and made a tactical decision not to call him. Nor is it otherwise a case to which the principles in Whitehorn and Apostilides or Kneebone apply. 
     
      
    15 Assuming for the moment that Biddle were a material witness, I do not consider that the mere fact that he had not made a statement to police or that his involvement was not learned of until after the start of the trial would have been sufficient to excuse the Crown from its obligation to call Biddle or make him available for cross-examination. To state what should be obvious after Kneebone, the Crown cannot avoid its obligations to call material witnesses by the expedient of electing not to take statements from persons whom it considers may be material witnesses. Further, given that Biddle was readily available to the police, I have some difficulty in understanding why the Crown did not attempt to take a statement from him once his significance was understood and, if that were not successful, to inform the defence that, although Biddle refused to make a statement, his whereabouts were known. It may be that those charged with the prosecution of the applicants did not know of Biddle’s bail status or make the connection between “BITAL” and Biddle. Other possibilities are open. But it is troubling that there is no explanation offered of why that process was not followed. 
     
      
    16 Counsel for the respondent advanced a further argument, however, which I think to be more persuasive. He submitted that, even if Biddle were prepared to give evidence to the effect that he was not involved in the burglary, Biddle’s evidence would have gone only to a collateral issue calculated to impeach the credit of the complainant and thus would not have been admissible (Evidence Act 1995, s 102). 
     
      
    17 I accept that submission. When Baker was cross-examined about the burglary he maintained that he had committed it in company with Biddle. If Biddle had been called and sworn that he was not involved in the burglary, his evidence may have damaged Baker’s credit. But it would not have established that Baker was not involved in the burglary. Logically, it would have gone only to the collateral issue of who Baker was with at the time of the burglary, as opposed to the fact in issue of where Baker was at the time of the burglary. And since there was no suggestion of bias (see AG v Hitchcock (1847) 1 Ex 91 at p 106; R v Harrington [1998] 3 VR 531; Cross on Evidence at [19045] or corruption (see Nicholls v The Queen (2005) 219 CLR 196 at p 263 at [175] per Gummow and Callinan JJ, and at p 292 at [269] per Hayne and Heydon JJ) or any other exception to the collateral evidence rule, (Evidence Act 1995, s 106) and no proper foundation was laid for the application for any exception, Biddle’s evidence as to not having participated in the burglary would in my view not have been admissible.  
     
      
    18 The point may be demonstrated by comparison with the High Court’s decision in Piddington v Bennett & Wood Pty Ltd (1940) 63 CLR 533; cf Nicholls v The Queen (2005) 219 CLR 196. In that case, a witness to a motor accident was asked why he had been at the scene at the time and he said that he was there because he had been attending to some banking business close by. It was sought to call the bank manager to say that there was no record of the witness having attended at the bank that day and it was held the bank manager’s evidence was inadmissible. The question of why the witness had been at the scene, as opposed to whether he had been at the scene, was a collateral issue which reflected only upon his credit and thus, under the common law finality rule which then applied to collateral issues, the witness’s evidence on the point had to be taken as final.  
     
      
    19 The collateral issue finality rule has been criticised. Those who disparage it point out that, as a matter of logic, collateral issues are frequently just as relevant as material issues and that the distinction between a fact in issue and a collateral issue is frequently arbitrary. But despite such criticisms, and some judicial attempts to relegate the principle to a rule of practice or case management, it remains as part of the Australian common law of evidence and, in this State, its effect is preserved under ss 102 and 106 of the Evidence Act 1995.  
     
      
    20 In the result, as it seems to me, Baker’s evidence that Biddle was with him at the burglary could no more have been contradicted by Biddle’s evidence that Biddle was not present at the burglary than the witness’s evidence in Piddington v Bennett & Wood that the witness was present because he had been banking could be contradicted by the evidence of the bank manager that the witness had not done any banking.  
     
      
    21 Counsel for the Crown advanced a further argument that, if the evidence of Biddle had been admissible, the force of the Crown’s direct and circumstantial case was such that Biddle’s evidence could not conceivably have made a difference to the jury’s verdict; and, therefore, that the Crown’s failure to call Biddle could not have caused a miscarriage of justice; or, at least, that any miscarriage which may have been caused was so insubstantial as to warrant application of the proviso. 
     
      
    22 In the view which I take of the inadmissibility of Biddle’s evidence, it is unnecessary for me to determine that point. But in case it matters, I should say that there appears to me to be considerable force in it. Baker’s evidence as to having been involved in the burglary of the Peacock house went to the question of motive. Biddle’s evidence, if believed, would have reflected adversely on Baker’s credit and thus detracted from the probability of his involvement, and so in turn from the applicant’s alleged motive to attack him. To that extent, Biddle’s evidence might have detracted from the overall strength of the Crown case. But there would have been nothing in the doubt so cast on the creditability of Baker’s evidence rationally to cause the jury to doubt Isgro’s evidence or the large body of circumstantial evidence which pointed strongly towards the applicants. In those circumstances, I think it is likely that the jury would still have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the applicants’ guilt. The only reason that one might hesitate before applying the proviso in such circumstances is that, if Biddle’s evidence had been admissible, it would have gone to Baker’s credit, and authority suggests that, where the application of the proviso turns upon an assessment of credit, the matter should ordinarily be left to a jury. (see Nudd v The Queen (2006) 225 ALR 161; AK v Western Australia (2008) 232 CLR 438; R v Nicoletti & Tolone [2006] VSCA 175).  
     
      
    23 As I say, however, I do not consider that Biddle’s evidence would have been admissible in the circumstances of this case and, on that basis, I would dismiss the application.  
     
      
    24 SIMPSON J: I have read in draft the judgment of Nettle AJA. Although I agree with the orders his Honour proposes, my analysis and the path by which I reach that conclusion is significantly different. On two aspects of his Honour’s draft I respectfully disagree with the approach his Honour takes.  
     
      
    25 It is unnecessary to re-state the facts, other than such as are material to these two issues. 
     
      
    26 My points of disagreement concern the potential admissibility of the evidence of Biddle, and the criticisms of the conduct of the Crown in failing to make Biddle available for cross-examination. 
     
      
       
      The admissibility of Biddle’s evidence 
       
      
    27 Shane Baker testified that, some months prior to the assaults, he had entered the Peacock home and had stolen a number of items, including a pound of marijuana, and some samurai swords. When he did this, he said, he was in company with Dale Biddle. Indeed, his evidence was that Biddle initiated the offence, by telephoning him and inviting him to join Biddle at the Peacock home. He gave some detail about what they had done while present in the apartment. He was cross-examined at some length on this issue. 
     
      
    28 Although it was common ground that there had been an occasion when the Peacock home was entered and property stolen, it was explicitly put to Baker in cross-examination that he had not been present on that occasion, a proposition that he rejected. 
     
      
    29 Baker’s evidence was put in the Crown case as going to establishing that the appellants had a motive for the attack upon Baker and Isgro. It was also put as explaining some remarks that Baker said had been made to him by one or other of his attackers, and questions asked of him, during the course of the attack the subject of the trial. 
     
      
    30 It is in this context that the only ground of appeal arises: it was contended that the Crown ought to have called Biddle as a witness and that its failure to do so amounted to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    31 For the purpose of evaluating this ground of appeal it must be assumed that Biddle, if called, would have given evidence in accordance with the statement annexed to his affidavit: that is, that he did not participate with Baker in the thefts at the Peacock home. 
     
      
    32 The questions which now arise are whether evidence to that effect by Biddle would have been admissible; and, if so, whether its absence from the trial caused a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    33 Nettle AJA considers that the evidence would not, by reason of s 102 of the Evidence Act 1995, have been admissible. That is because, in his view, the evidence is relevant only to Baker’s credibility. It is with this view that I disagree. 
     
      
    34 S 102 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Evidence that is relevant only to a witness’s credibility is not admissible.” 
        
       
      
    35 S 102 perpetuates a distinction drawn by the common law between evidence relevant to a fact in issue and evidence relevant only to the credibility of a witness. Whether a particular tendered item of evidence “is relevant only to a witness’s credibility” is not always easy to determine. Of the common law position, McHugh J has said, in Palmer v The Queen [1998] HCA 2; 193 CLR 1: 
     
      
       
        
        “52. The rationale behind the credit and facts in issue distinction does not depend on logic. It ‘is based primarily upon the need to confine the trial process and secondarily upon notions of fairness to the witness’. It is rooted in the need for ‘case management’ rules. The distinction is regarded as necessary to prevent the trial of a case being burdened with the side issues that would arise if parties could investigate matters whose only real probative value was that ‘they tended to show the veracity or falsity of the witness who was giving evidence which  
        was  
        relevant to the issue’. It is for that reason, as Lord Pearce pointed out in  
        Toohey v Metropolitan Police Commissioner  
        [[1965] AC 595 at 607] that ‘[m]any controversies which might … obliquely throw some light on the issues must in practice be discarded because there is not an infinity of time, money and mental comprehension available to make use of them.’ 
        
       
       
        
        That being so, the evidentiary rules based on the distinction between issues of credit and facts-in-issue should not be regarded as hard and fast rules of law but should instead be seen ‘as a well established guide to the exercise of judicial regulation of the litigation process’ [ 
        Natta v Canham  
        (1991) 32 FCR 282.] This view is consistent with the statement of that formidable advocate and judge, Sir Hayden Starke …, where he accepted that the finality rule is ‘a rule of convenience, and not of principle’. To elevate the finality rule and the prohibition on bolstering to fixed rules of law rather than rules of convenience would be a mistake, particularly as the finality rule has been strongly criticised.” (italics in original; internal references omitted) 
        
       
      
    36 McHugh J went on to quote the English Court of Appeal in R v Funderburk [1990] 1 WLR 587; [1990] 2 All ER 482, saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “The difficulty we have in applying that celebrated test is that it seems to us to be circular. If a fact is not collateral then clearly you can call evidence to contradict it, but the so-called test is silent on how you decide whether that fact is collateral. The utility of the test may lie in the fact that the answer is an instinctive one based on the prosecutor’s and the court’s sense of fair play rather than any philosophic or analytic process.” 
        
       
      
    37 McHugh J also said: 
     
      
       
        
        “55. No doubt considerations of case management require that not all evidence going to the credibility of a witness should be admissible. Much of it, while relevant to the issues in a logical sense, has so little probative value with respect to those issues that it is impracticable to admit it. For reasons of convenience, it is necessary to maintain the rule that independent evidence rebutting the witness’s denials on  
        matters going to credibility 
         is not ordinarily admissible. In this, as in other areas of the law of evidence, a distinction exists between what is relevant and what is admissible. …” (italics added; internal reference omitted) 
        
       
      
    38 Two cautions need to be observed in applying his Honour’s strong views in the present case. Firstly, the judgment was a dissenting one (although I do not understand the majority to have expressed views inconsistent with those of McHugh J on this subject); secondly, the remarks were made in the context of an appeal from the Supreme Court of Victoria, a state where the common law rules of evidence apply. In this state this Court must give full weight to the circumstance that the legislature has effectively re-enacted the common law rule. It is therefore necessary to give effect to the principle. But the practical difficulty in doing so to which McHugh J draws attention is not diminished by the terms of the legislation. 
     
      
    39 It is only evidence that is relevant solely to a witness’s credibility that is excluded by s 102. Evidence that is otherwise relevant is not excluded by that section (although it may be excluded on some other basis). 
     
      
    40 In Adam v The Queen [2001] HCA 57; 207 CLR 96, the High Court rejected an argument that s 102 should not be read literally. The Court formulated the correct question (precisely in terms of the legislation) as: 
     
      
       
        
        “Is it [the evidence in question] relevant  
        only 
         to a witness’s credibility?” (italics in original) 
        
       
      
    41 By s 56 of the Evidence Act, evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is admissible in that proceeding (except as otherwise provided). In s 55(1), relevant evidence is defined in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The evidence that is relevant in a proceeding is evidence that, if it were accepted, could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceeding.” 
        
       
      
    42 Relevance does not depend upon weight, reliability, or the likelihood or otherwise that the evidence will be accepted. The assessment of relevance proceeds upon the assumption that the evidence will be accepted. 
     
      
    43 S 102 has been considered by this Court previously. In R v Chen [2002] NSWCCA 174 the Court, constituted by Heydon JA (as his Honour then was), Sully and Levine JJ, was considering whether evidence adduced by the prosecution that a prosecution witness had provided a written undertaking to co-operate with law enforcement authorities was admitted in breach of s 102, because it was tendered as evidence relevant only to that witness’s credibility. The Court held that it was not, because it was tendered for another purpose: pursuant to the Crown’s duty of fairness (in the disclosure of the status of the witness). In other words, as I read the judgment, the Court, in accordance with Adam, gave weight to the word “only” as it appears in s 102. (Interestingly, the Court did not distinguish between the purpose for which the evidence was tendered, and its relevance to a fact or facts in issue.) 
     
      
    44 S 102 is, as I have mentioned, a statutory formulation of a common law rule, for which the most commonly cited authority is Piddington v Bennett & Wood Pty Ltd [1940] HCA 2; 63 CLR 533. 
     
      
    45 Examination of the judgments in Piddington illustrates and highlights the difficulty that can be involved in determining whether a particular item of evidence is relevant only to the credibility of a witness, or has some broader relevance. The nearest to a general statement of the rule that emerges from that case is to be found in the (minority) judgment of Latham CJ, who said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Any witness may be cross-examined for the purpose of discrediting him. But if questions affect only the credit of a witness and are not relevant to the matters actually in issue in the case, the witness’s answers cannot be contradicted by other evidence except in certain exceptional cases.” 
        
       
      
    46 His Honour then set out some exceptions – that a party may, after cross-examination of the opponent’s witnesses, give evidence to show that they are “notorious liars”, or have given their testimony from a corrupt or other wrong motive, or have previously made statements inconsistent with the evidence they have given. 
     
      
    47 None of the other members of the court stated the principle; the case was no more than an application of what was recognised as an established rule, in circumstances where the questioned evidence sat near to the boundary, resulting in the differing views that can be found in the separate judgments. Latham CJ and Starke J thought that the evidence there in question was admissible; the remaining members of the court thought otherwise. 
     
      
    48 In certain passages some light on the different approaches is cast. Latham CJ held that it was always permissible to give evidence as to the facts in issue, and as to facts relevant to facts in issue. He considered that, where a witness had purported to give eye-witness evidence of events constituting the facts in issue, then the other party was entitled to call evidence to show that that witness was not present at the relevant time or place, or that, if he were, he could not have seen what he claimed to have seen. 
     
      
    49 Starke J agreed that such evidence would be admissible, and, on the facts of Piddington, felt that the evidence there in question was relevant to that fact. 
     
      
    50 Evatt J also dealt with the question, in part, with reference to the admissibility of evidence concerning the presence or otherwise at a relevant place or time of a witness who has given evidence of such presence. He appeared to accept that evidence that a particular witness had “garnished his account of the relevant facts with associated details designed to give verisimilitude” would be admissible. However, the real test for Evatt J depended upon remoteness. His Honour held that remoteness involves considerations of degree, and that a trial judge must exclude the evidence in contradiction of a witness’s evidence “at the very point where the relationship has become too remote.” 
     
      
    51 It was because the result in Piddington really depended upon an evaluation of how remote the evidence was from the facts in issue that different judges took different views. Whether a particular item of evidence is relevant only to the credibility of a witness or not will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each individual case. 
     
      
    52 Contrary to the views expressed by Nettle AJA, I have come to the conclusion that the relevance of the evidence Biddle could give was not confined to Baker’s credibility. The “fact in issue” to which it was relevant was that the appellants were (or either of them was) the perpetrator(s) of the attacks on Baker and Isgro. The Crown sought to prove that fact by, inter alia, direct identification evidence of both complainants; and by proving, through Baker’s evidence of the thefts, that each of the appellants had a motive to attack him.  
     
      
    53 Motive was certainly relevant to the identification of the appellants as the perpetrators. Baker’s evidence went directly to that question. 
     
      
    54 Could, then, the evidence that Biddle would have given also go to that issue? In my opinion it could, although less directly. 
     
      
    55 The answer depends upon an analysis of the content of the evidence given by Baker. It was not merely an assertion that he had entered the Peacock home and stolen property. It went further than that, and gave colour to that evidence by the addition of supporting detail: one detail was that he was in company with Biddle, others were what each of them did, and stole, whilst in the premises. 
     
      
    56 Since (rather curiously) it was in the interests of the appellants to cast doubt upon Baker’s evidence that he had been guilty of the thefts, it would have been open to them to call evidence, for example, that no thefts had occurred from the house at the relevant time, or that any thefts that had occurred had been committed by somebody else, or that property of the kind described by Baker had not been present in the premises. Evidence of that kind would have cast doubt upon Baker’s evidence, and the Crown case on motive, and it can not be suggested that it would not have been admissible in the appellants’ cases. 
     
      
    57 Biddle’s evidence, in my opinion, would also have been capable of casting doubt on that evidence given by Baker. There is, in my opinion, a distinction to be drawn between evidence going to the credibility of a witness, and evidence going to the credibility of the evidence given by that witness (in this context it might be better to use the word “reliability”). Section 102 prohibits evidence going only to the former: it does not prohibit evidence going only to the latter of which an obvious example is evidence contradicting facts asserted by a witness. The reliability of evidence given by a witness might be challenged by evidence contradicting all, or part, of that witness’s evidence. That contradictory evidence is not rendered inadmissible by s 102. 
     
      
    58 A classic example of evidence relevant to the credibility of a witness is evidence that, on another, unconnected, occasion, that witness had lied on oath. Subject to the restrictions imposed by s 103, and, in a criminal case, s 104, cross-examination of that witness on that subject is permissible; but what used to be called the collateral evidence rule, now s 102, precludes the adducing of such evidence from another source. 
     
      
    59 I make no comment on the weight that might be attributed to Biddle’s evidence. Biddle’s evidence, if accepted, would have been capable of casting doubt on Baker’s account of the thefts in respect of the surrounding detail, and therefore upon the central fact that he alleged. It is true, as Nettle AJA says, that Biddle’s evidence could not have established that Baker was not involved in the burglary. But that is not the question posed by s 102. That question is whether Biddle’s evidence was relevant to some issue other than Baker’s credibility. In my opinion it was. True it is that Biddle’s evidence is more remote than that of Baker, and, therefore, has less probative value. But that does not mean that it was not relevant to a fact in issue. 
     
      
    60 The issue might be tested this way: could the appellants have called Biddle to deny that he was involved in the entry and theft? I find it difficult to imagine that any trial judge would reject, as evidence going only to the credibility of a Crown witness, evidence of a defence witness directly contradicting one significant aspect of the evidence of that Crown witness. This neatly illustrates the slipperiness of the distinction between “fact in issue evidence” and “credibility evidence”. 
     
      
    61 If the appellants could have called him, the Crown could have called Biddle. I have come to the conclusion that Bidddle’s evidence, had he been called, would not have been inadmissible by reason of s 102.  
     
      
       
       
      The failure of the Crown to call Biddle: miscarriage of justice? 
       
      
    62 The second question, therefore, is whether the absence of Biddle’s evidence from the trial caused a miscarriage of justice. This question, also, is in two parts: whether Biddle’s evidence could realistically be seen as being capable of having a bearing on the outcome; and, if so, whether the Crown was under an obligation to make Biddle available. 
     
      
    63 In my opinion the first part of the question ought to be answered negatively. In one sense, this involves an approach to the evidence of the kind outlined by the High Court in Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300, concerning the application of the proviso to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. Weiss, of course, involved the consideration of the application of the proviso after the wrongful admission (as distinct from omission) of evidence. But the decision in Weiss requires an appellate court: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … so far as it properly can, to judge the evidence for itself.” 
        
       
      
    64 Here, the Crown case was, in reality, overwhelming. Both complainants gave evidence that it was the appellants who had attacked them. Both complainants were well acquainted with both appellants.  
     
      
    65 Further, the jury could not have regarded Biddle’s evidence other than with the utmost scepticism (in saying this I am conscious that Biddle was not cross-examined during the proceedings on appeal and this Court has not had the opportunity to make any evaluation of his credibility or demeanour). 
     
      
    66 In these circumstances it is strictly unnecessary to answer the second part of the second question. However, I would make these observations. 
     
      
    67 The trial was fixed to commence on Monday 13 March 2006. For reasons not explained, but apparently to do with court administration, a jury was not empanelled until Thursday 16 March. That jury was immediately (even before being sworn) discharged, on grounds quite unrelated to the present appeal. 
     
      
    68 On 15 March counsel for the appellants sought leave to cross-examine Baker, in a limited way, on the principles stated in R v Basha (1989) 39 A Crim R 337. This was because the Crown had disclosed that Baker had recently admitted his participation in the thefts from the Peacock home, and the Crown proposed to call that evidence as evidence of motive. This was new material, both to the Crown and the defence. Leave to cross-examine was granted and the enquiry took place on Thursday 16 March. It was during initial questioning by the Crown prosecutor that Baker asserted, for the first time, that his co-offender in the thefts had been Dale Biddle. 
     
      
    69 A new jury was empanelled on Monday 20 March, and the trial began and proceeded. At that time no statement had been taken from Biddle by either side. At no time was any request made on behalf of the appellants that the Crown make Biddle available. This is hardly surprising: Biddle would have done one of only two things. Either he would have admitted his involvement in the thefts, thereby corroborating Baker’s evidence and strengthening the Crown case on motive; or he would have denied it. It is entirely within the bounds of possibility that the appellants’ legal representatives made a considered, tactical (and reasonable) decision not to ask the Crown to make Biddle available. To have done so may well have prompted the Crown to make its own inquiries, to the potential detriment of the appellants. To have asked the Crown to make Biddle available, without knowing what he would have said, would have been an extremely risky, hazardous, gamble. Alternatively, the appellants’ legal representatives may not have turned their minds to the possibility of seeking to have Biddle called, or perceived his possible evidence in the way his present legal representatives do.70 No explanation has been provided by trial counsel for not requesting that he be made available. This may have been, in recognition of the possibility that he would corroborate Baker, for tactical reasons; or it may have been because counsel did not consider his evidence likely to have any real bearing on the outcome of the trial. Either way, it does not now assist the appellants. 
     
      
    71 Nor is there any evidence that the legal representatives of the appellants made any attempt to locate Biddle themselves. It is interesting to note that, in the submissions now made on behalf of the appellants, it was observed that, for the purposes of the appeal, a legal clerk was able to locate Biddle and obtain a statement from him. From that, it was suggested that the Crown could have done the same thing. But the submission cuts both ways. So also could the legal representatives of the appellants at the trial (notwithstanding the significantly greater resources of the Crown).  
     
      
    72 I also would not accept the proposition that, because there was evidence that Biddle was obliged, by reasons of bail conditions, to report to police on a regular basis, “the police” would have had no difficulty in locating him to give evidence at the trial. 
     
      
    73 “The police” and “the prosecution” are not an amorphous mass having a corporate mind or corporate knowledge. In order to show some relevant failing on the part of the Crown, it would be necessary, in my opinion, to show that some person connected with the prosecution of the appellants had relevant knowledge. 
     
      
    74 I would infer that nobody, including counsel for the appellants, considered that Biddle could give any relevant evidence. Whether that was correct or not, it explains the absence of Biddle from the trial. In particular, if it be the fact that no request was made on behalf of the appellants because their legal representatives did not think of it, the same must apply to the prosecuting team. 
     
      
    75 Given the circumstances, I do not think any fair criticism can be made of the Crown on this occasion. 
     
      
    76 For the reasons I have given I would dismiss each appeal.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: On 3 November 2007 Ms Jessica Loiterton went out socialising with some of her friends. She drank more than she should have and her friends decided to send her home in a taxi, giving her money for that purpose. The taxi driver who picked her up was the offender. He took advantage of her extremely vulnerable state by indecently assaulting and then raping her. He now stands to be sentenced for those offences. 2 When Ms Loiterton got into the taxi she was significantly intoxicated. She had already vomited and did so once more whilst in the taxi. The offender well knew the state Ms Loiterton was in, seeing her vomit out of his taxi window. She was drifting in and out of sleep. She did recall however that at one stage the offender began to touch her. She said that he reached up her sleeve and moved his hand down on to her breasts. Ms Loiterton had done nothing to invite such attention and conveyed her lack of consent by pulling away from him and saying, “no, don’t.” That assault upon Ms Loiterton is the first of the counts in the indictment, an offence of indecent assault carrying a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.3 Some time later, the offender further indecently assaulted Ms Loiterton, by touching her between the legs. She must have been asleep at the time of this offence because she has no memory of this occurring. However, when interviewed by police the offender told police that this is what he did, but he claimed it was part of consensual sexual activity initiated by Ms Loiterton. The jury clearly rejected that version of events and found the offender guilty of this offence as well. It also carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment.4 At one stage Ms Loiterton awoke to find that the taxi had stopped. She did not know where she was. The offender caused her to move from the front seat, where she was sitting, to the back seat of the taxi. He took down the right side of her pants, removed a tampon from her vagina, and then raped her by putting his penis inside her vagina, having sexual intercourse with her until he ejaculated. Ms Loiterton could not have indicated her lack of consent to this activity in any clearer manner. She said, “no, no, no” and then started crying as the offender commenced to rape her. She said, “no, don’t, take me home now,” when the offender persisted. The offender did not stop. 5 After he was finished Ms Loiterton was able to grab her mobile phone, get out of the taxi and call triple 0. The recording of the telephone call was played to the jury. It was very powerful evidence in the Crown case, demonstrating clearly the distress of a young woman who has just been violated by a complete stranger. 6 The case for the accused at trial was that Ms Loiterton initiated the whole thing. According to the defence case it was Ms Loiterton who asked the accused to touch her on the breast and then, when she got into the back seat of the taxi, said, “fuck me.” Ms McSpedden, who appeared for the offender, submitted to the jury that the reason that Ms Loiterton was distressed when she got out of the taxi shortly after having sexual intercourse with the accused was that, because of her intoxication, she had no memory of having consented to what took place. One only has to state the substance of the defence argument to demonstrate its implausibility. 7 Character evidence was called by the accused at trial, although he did not give evidence himself. Even today he has not given evidence but has instead relied on a handwritten document which he asked me to read. At his trial one of his character witnesses said that, from his limited understanding of what was alleged to have occurred, it was the offender who was the victim. I have, of course, to be careful not to impose a longer sentence than would otherwise be appropriate because of the way in which the offender conducted his defence. He was of course entitled, without penalty, to plead not guilty and to put forward a palpably false version of events which portrayed the complainant as a woman prepared to have sex with a complete stranger in the back of a taxi. I mention the nature of the defence case because it is relevant for other purposes, including whether the offender has shown remorse, and his prospects of rehabilitation. I will say quite clearly that the offender has shown no remorse whatsoever. He maintains his version of events when speaking to Probation and Parole officers and a psychologist who prepared a report that was tendered before me today. 8 I repeat, he has shown no remorse. I cannot therefore find that he has good prospects of rehabilitation or that he is unlikely to re-offend in the future. Perhaps the only thing that might tend to suggest that he may not re-offend in the future is the substantial sentence I shall shortly impose upon him.9 It is perhaps appropriate to say something about the conduct of Ms Loiterton and her friends that evening. I would hope that what I am about to say is unnecessary but in case there are those that consider that to some extent Ms Loiterton was the author of her own misfortune, I want to say in clear and unmistakeable terms that Ms Loiterton and her friends were completely blameless and no one should think that they contributed in the slightest way to the events I have described. Ms Loiterton’s friends were entitled to assume that they had looked after her in her vulnerable state by ensuring that she got a taxi and giving her enough money to pay for the taxi. Ms Loiterton was entitled to assume that, even if she became intoxicated, a complete stranger would not take advantage of her vulnerability by raping her. 10 I repeat Ms Loiterton and her friends were blameless. Householders who do not put iron bars on their windows are not blamed if someone breaks into their home. Victims of fraud are not blamed for being taken in by clever con men and Ms Loiterton and her friends cannot be blamed for the predatory behaviour of the offender. 11 It is clear that there must be a substantial component of general deterrence built in to any sentence to be imposed upon the offender. It is a fact of life that every day of the week many members of society drink more than they should, and then need to get home safely. What are they supposed to do? They cannot drive. If they try and get public transport they can be refused access to what little public transport there is these days, and often the only real alternative is to get a taxi. There must be many young people, vulnerable because of their intoxication, in taxis every night of the week, many of whom would be easy prey at the hands of an offender such as Mr Ali. A message must be sent to those who might be tempted to take advantage of that situation for their own sexual gratification, that if they do, they will go to gaol for a long time. 12 The offence of sexual intercourse without consent carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. It has a standard non-parole period of seven years. The standard non-parole period is appropriate for an offence in the middle of the range for objective seriousness. Here the objective seriousness was high, involving full penile/vaginal intercourse, including the offender ejaculating. He did not, of course, use a condom. I should interpolate here that I have found beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did ejaculate inside Ms Loiterton’s vagina. His counsel made a submission at trial that what occurred was some form of coitus interruptus, with the accused managing to delay ejaculation until he got back in to the front seat of the taxi. Given the finding of semen containing DNA which matched that of the accused in Ms Loiterton’s vagina, and the extreme unlikelihood that the offender could have delayed ejaculation until he got back in to the front seat of his cab and driven away, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender, whom I repeat was not using a condom, ejaculated in Ms Loiterton’s vagina.13 The non-sexual violence associated with the offence appears to have been relatively minor, but that was precisely because of the complainant’s vulnerability. Had the offender occasioned actual bodily harm to Ms Loiterton he would have been guilty of a different offence, and it is not a mitigating feature of one offence that a more serious offence was not committed. 14 In assessing whether the offence does fall within the mid range of objective seriousness I take into account the form of the sexual intercourse, the fact that there was ejaculation, that Ms Loiterton was extremely vulnerable and that the offence was premeditated. I am able to find that it was premeditated because the evidence establishes that the offender deviated from the route he would otherwise have taken in order to go in to the back street where the offence took place. I am also satisfied, and I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that the offender turned off the security camera in the taxi in order to ensure that there was no photographic record of what he did. The evidence at trial established that a driver could switch off the security camera by means of a switch located under the back seat. When the taxi was stopped, police found that the back seat was not in its proper position. On top of that, there is the obvious circumstance that there was a substantial gap between the last photograph recorded on the security camera, and the next one, shortly before the police arrived. 15 It was in that substantial gap that these three offences occurred. The offences had terrible consequences for Ms Loiterton. These are entirely understandable. They are the sorts of things that occur almost invariably when a serious offence like this is committed. It is for that reason that the courts treat very seriously sexual assaults of this kind. I am, however, unable to take into account, as an aggravating feature, the effects on Ms Loiterton precisely because they are exactly what is expected from offences of this type. The Court of Criminal Appeal has held harm to a victim can only be taken into account as an aggravating feature when that harm is unusual or beyond what would be expected.16 The offender is now twenty-two years of age. He was born in Bangladesh in 1985. His family remain there. He grew up in a poor farming family, which struggled to make ends meet. He came to Australia in 2005 on a student visa after having completed some aspects of his education in Bangladesh. He completed high school and started a mechanical engineering degree there, but that was left incomplete when he came to Australia. In 2006 he completed, in Australia, an accounting diploma and commenced studying for a bachelor of accounting. However, he did not complete that after being arrested and was bail refused. Whilst studying he supported himself with a number of jobs, including of course employment as a taxi driver.17 The offender has no significant record, having only traffic matters on his criminal history. Apart from these current offences he appears to have been of otherwise good character. They are matters of mitigation which I will take into account in his favour. There are suggestions in some of the material before me today that the offender was sexually naïve, but it does not take much to understand just how wrong his conduct was. I repeat that he knew full well how vulnerable Ms Loiterton was when she got in to the taxi. Her description of drifting in and out of sleep and the fact that she vomited because of her intoxication made the offender fully aware of her vulnerable state. To take advantage of that situation as a taxi driver is a very serious matter indeed, requiring, as I said, a substantial component of general deterrence in the sentences I will now announce.18 I have found, for the reasons I gave earlier, that the offence of sexual intercourse without consent is above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Even taking into account the mitigating factors in the offender’s favour, I have determined that the non-parole period will be greater than that provided for an offence in the middle of the range, that is the seven year standard non-parole period sentence. I have also determined that the sentences for counts 1 and 2 on the indictment will be served wholly concurrently, they being part and parcel really of what occurred to Ms Loiterton that evening. There are no special circumstances in this case. To take into account matters such as the offender’s good character in making a finding of special circumstances would be to double count. It is the offender’s first time in custody and that has sometimes been held, indeed often been held, to be a special circumstance, but the non-parole period I will shortly announce is the shortest which I consider is appropriate in the circumstances of this case.19 On counts 1 and 2 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set fixed terms of two years to commence 4 November 2007, the day on which Mr Ali went into custody. Those sentences are fixed terms because of the sentence I will now announce on count 4. 20 On count 4 on the indictment the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of eight years to commence on 4 November 2007 and a head sentence of ten years and eight months. The offender is therefore eligible to be released to parole on 3 November 2015. 21 The period of eligibility for parole is two years eight months.

    JUDGMENTHIS HONOUR: Mr Terkmani I am going to sentence you now. First I give my reasons which will take twenty minutes or so. I read out why I am reaching the decision that I am and then at the end of that I will sentence you and you will hear what the sentence is. Do you understand that?OFFENDER: Yes.HIS HONOUR: And I do not tell you in advance what the sentence is because I want you to listen to the reasons.1. I am sentencing Abdullah Terkmani for a very serious crime. The crime is aggravated break enter and commit serious indictable offence. The serious indictable offence is an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The crime is against s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The crime carries a maximum sentence fixed by Parliament of fourteen years imprisonment. Not only that, Parliament has fixed to this crime what is called a standard non-parole period. The standard non-parole period for this crime is five years. 2. The main issue that I need to resolve in sentencing Mr Terkmani is whether or not I apply the standard non-parole period.3. First I need to say what happened to bring about Mr Terkmani being charged with this crime. It was about 7.30 on the night of 15 December 2004. Dean Phillips was at home with a friend, Kristina Wren. Mr Phillips’ house - mate, Anthony Halliwell, was away for the weekend. Mr Phillips heard the front door bell ring. He ignored it. It kept ringing. Mr Phillips looked through the front window and saw a man - the jury found beyond reasonable doubt it was Abdullah Terkmani - standing outside the house. He was standing there with somebody else. Mr Phillips recognised neither of them. The men were demanding to know where Tony Halliwell was. Mr Phillips told them to go away and that he was going to call the police. 4. What happened then must have been a shocking experience for both Mr Phillips and Ms Wren. It is a householder’s nightmare. Mr Terkmani went next and got a brick from a pile of bricks. He threw it through the front window of Mr Phillips’ home. He then produced a knife. He tried to get into the house through the broken window. The other man stayed on the porch while this was happening. Mr Phillips tried to resist Mr Terkmani getting in. The other man helped by pulling the curtain back. Mr Terkmani got in. He demanded that Mr Phillips open the door for his accomplice. Mr Phillips did so, opening the back door. The other man came in. Then they both started punching Mr Phillips with their fists. Mr Phillips fell to the ground and they continued to assault him.5. The result of the assault was that Mr Phillips ended up with a black eye, a bleeding nose and a tooth that went through his top lip. This left him with blurred vision and a sore jaw. The men kept looking for Anthony Halliwell. The other man produced a syringe. He demanded that Mr Phillips and Ms Wren remove their shirts but they refused. Mr Terkmani who was in another part of the house came back at that time and suggested that they leave. The other man threatened the two with the syringe but then left with Mr Terkmani. A neighbour called the police who arrived a short time afterwards.6. Mr Terkmani got away but was detected to be the offender because he had left DNA on the brick. As I have already said, this must have been a shocking experience for Mr Phillips and Ms Wren. 7. The first thing I need to do is to determine whether this case should be dealt with with the standard non-parole period of five years. The Court of Criminal Appeal in Regina v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 said that I need to ask and answer the following question: “Are there reasons for not imposing the standard non-parole period?” The Court went on to say that I answer that by considering two matters. One is the objective seriousness of the offence and the other is the circumstances of aggravation and of mitigation which are present and which are listed in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.8. First then I consider the objective seriousness of the offence. Mr Gibson who appeared for the prosecution argued that the offence fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness; even, he argued, in the upper part of the middle of the range. He argued that based on the following aspects of the offence.HIS HONOUR: I’ll just pause there from delivering my remarks on sentence, I just need to check Mr Modder, what was the aggravation relied upon? I just don’t have a note of it specifically.MODDER: Assault occasioning actual bodily harm. I’m sorry your Honour. Just one minute.HIS HONOUR: No that’s part of the offence is it not. I need to know what the circumstances of aggravation were that were relied upon by the Crown in the prosecutionMODDER: Yes just looking at the notes here your Honour the fact that the offence was committed in company, that the offender knew that there were persons inside the premises--HIS HONOUR: I know there were several circumstances of aggravation, I’m just wondering which one the Crown relied on in the prosecution.MODDER: Yes. The offender was armed with a knife, the co-offender with a syringe your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Is that the one, the armed with an offensive weapon?MODDER: Yeah, corporal violence--HIS HONOUR: More than one, what was actually relied upon--MODDER: But that’s within the assault occasioning actual bodily harm.HIS HONOUR: What was relied upon before the jury as the circumstance of aggravation, that’s my question.MODDER: Your Honour those that I’ve got here are just as I’ve read out from my friend’s paper basically as I wasn’t involved in the trial of course but the notes that I’ve got here--HIS HONOUR: I’d forgotten. You weren’t instructing, were you in that trial, no.MODDER: No, other ones yes but not this one.HIS HONOUR: Yes.MODDER: But the notes I’ve got here was offender in company, offender knew persons in premises, knife, co-offender had a syringe, corporal violence--HIS HONOUR: Okay, all right.MODDER: Threatened use of a weapon, a knife.9. As will be apparent from the exchange which has just occurred I am not clear what the circumstance of aggravation was that was relied upon by the Crown before the jury but it could have been any one of a number of factors which Mr Gibson has pointed to. They include the following. The offender was in company. The offender knew that there were persons inside the house. The offender was armed with an offensive weapon. The offence was committed in the home of the victim. Those matters I take into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence. There are some additional matters which go to the objective seriousness of the offence which require a little more comment. 10. The first is that the co-offender produced a syringe. I do not take that into account as a separate offensive weapon being used in the offence. That is because I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Mr Terkmani knew that his co-offender had a syringe when they entered the house. Indeed it seems he was absent when it was produced. Nevertheless I do take it into account as part of the aggravating feature of being in company. One of the reasons why committing offences like this in company is aggravating is that an offender cannot always control what their co-offender may do. In this case the co-offender produced a syringe so, as I say, that is taken into account as part of the aggravating factor of the offence being committed in company. That aspect of the aggravation is modified a little by the fact that the offender at that point suggested that they both leave the house. 11. A second aggravating feature which requires a little more consideration is that the offence was planned. It was not spontaneous or opportunistic. However, it was clearly not well planned because Mr Halliwell was not at home. But nevertheless it was not a spontaneous or opportunistic enterprise. 12. I also take into account in assessing the objective seriousness of the offence the fact that the actual offence committed was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm carrying a maximum of five years imprisonment. That is the minimum period of imprisonment which must be attached to a serious indictable offence for something to be an offence under that section. As Mr Todd - who appeared for Mr Terkmani in the sentence proceedings - argued, there are far worse kinds of offences which may have been committed, for example, sexual assaults. I am inclined to accept Mr Gibson’s submission on that point. Were the offence committed inside the house much worse than it was, then the charge or rather the objective seriousness of the offence may well have been in the upper range. 13. A further factor I take into account is that the offence was committed over a relatively short period of time. It was reasonably short in scope.14. Another factor which I take into account, which became apparent in the evidence in the trial, was that there was clearly some motive for the two offenders looking for Mr Halliwell. It was not a spontaneous or gratuitous act of violence accompanied by a theft, for example. There was a purpose in the offenders entering the house and my recollection is that that purpose may have been related to their opinion about the character or behaviour of Mr Halliwell. 15. I take into account that the brick being thrown through the window must have been a terrifying experience for the occupants. 16. With all those factors I need to determine where the case lies in the range of objective seriousness. My own impression when listening to the argument presented by Mr Gibson and Mr Todd was that this case clearly fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. However I have since consulted some judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal on this offence. Those judgments lead me to what I respectfully regard as the surprising conclusion that this offence does not fall within the middle of the range of objective seriousness but falls below it. 17. One such decision was Regina v Joel Tory, Regina v Luke Tory [2006] NSWCCA 18. That was a case where two men broke into a house and assaulted the occupant with a golf club. They were under the impression that the man they assaulted had inappropriate or improper dealings with a young woman, indeed with the fourteen year old sister of one of the offenders. The whole incident took about two minutes. Adams J, with whom on this point Hunt AJA and Latham J agreed, concluded at [37] that in his Honour’s view it was “clear that the objective seriousness of the offences committed here is significantly less than the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind.” His Honour took into account that the offenders were motivated by a genuine desire to protect their sister and that the infliction of bodily violence was spontaneous and unplanned. His Honour also took into account that the offence was a very brief duration. 18. In Mr Terkmani’s case the offence was similarly of fairly brief duration, although perhaps not as brief as two minutes. I expect the infliction of the bodily violence was spontaneous and unplanned in the sense that the men announced before they came in that they were looking for Anthony Halliwell. Although the motivation in this case was not as clear as it was in Tory’s case, there is some similarity in that the men were focused on finding a man whom they regarded as having a bad character.19. In Regina v Millar [2005] NSWCCA 202 the Court of Criminal Appeal was dealing with another case where a man broke into a house and assaulted the occupant. The assault resulted in some haemorrhaging in the right eye and fractures around the right eye as well as the nasal bones. It required surgery. The court did not take exception to the finding of the sentencing judge that “despite the objective seriousness of the case, a combination of the mitigating factors takes this case outside the middle range of cases to which the standard non-parole period generally applies”. His Honour the sentencing judge went on to find that that case was “considerably below” that range. 20. Again in Regina v Price [2005] NSWCCA 285 the Court of Criminal Appeal was dealing with a case where a man broke into a house and assaulted the occupant with a wooden stick. Once again a feature of the case was that the offender thought that the victim had assaulted the offender’s father. The Court of Criminal Appeal did not disapprove of the sentencing judge’s finding that that offence fell “below the mid range, and quite a way below”. 21. But for those authorities I would have found that this offence fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. However because the offence was committed over a relatively short period of time, because the planning was limited and the violence spontaneous, I regard the case as falling just below the middle of the range of objective seriousness.22. If I am wrong in this finding then in any event I would and do find that there are reasons in this case contained in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act to depart from the standard non-parole period. Those reasons are contained in exhibit A which is the Pre-Sentence Report tendered in this case dated 23 October 2008. 23. One of the findings that I make involves accepting a submission by Mr Todd regarding Mr Terkmani’s age. Mr Terkmani was nineteen when he committed this offence. He is now twenty three. Mr Todd, in his submissions, argued that younger men make poor choices. He said that indiscretions become criminal activities. With age comes better judgment. In my opinion, this case leaves me with the impression that it was a very ill-considered attempt to confront Mr Halliwell whom, rightly or wrongly, the offenders regarded as requiring confrontation. That activity turned into a very serious crime when they refused to accept Mr Phillips’ assurances that Mr Halliwell was not there. Their entry into the house was a dangerous and ill-considered move. However I accept Mr Todd’s submission that that move probably stemmed from or had a lot to do with the offender’s age. 24. Another factor which I take into account, turning now to the Pre-Sentence Report, is the good family support which this offender receives. It is described in the report as considerable. In addition he is a qualified tradesman and undertook his education to obtain his trade at the same time as working. He enjoys a good employment history and is described in the Pre-Sentence Report as having “strong work and family ethics”. He is well regarded by his employer who regards him as having leadership potential and would consider providing him with employment upon his release. He has in the past been compliant with a community service order. 25. Those factors in my opinion lead me to conclude that he has good prospects of rehabilitation although that conclusion is a little guarded because of the fact that Mr Terkmani committed another assault last year which led to a conviction in the Gosford Local Court of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 26. So I take into account under s 21A(3) Mr Terkmani’s age and his prospects of rehabilitation. They would provide me with reasons in this case to depart from the standard non-parole period. 27. However the offence is so serious that I am satisfied, having considered all possible alternatives, that no penalty other than imprisonment and imprisonment full time is appropriate. The question is where I fix that sentence. I have had regard to the statistics which have been published by the Judicial Commission of New South Wales and provided to me as part of exhibit A. Over fifty per cent of sentences imposed in cases such of this are four years or less. Over fifty per cent of non-parole periods are of two years or less. Because Mr Terkmani did not plead guilty and, as he was entitled to do, defended the charge, it means that he does not attract the discount that a plea of guilty provides to other offenders who decide to plead guilty. 28. I regard an appropriate overall sentence in this case as four years imprisonment. Mr Todd submitted that there are special circumstances for finding that the balance of the term must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence. He points to the offender’s youth and that it is his first time in custody and his prospects of rehabilitation. Mr Gibson does not dispute that submission. I find that there are special circumstances for varying that ratio. I have determined that the non-parole period should be two years. The sentence will date from when Mr Terkmani has been in custody, namely 27 August 2008. 29. I am going to sentence you now Mr Terkmani if you would stand up. I set a non-parole period for the sentence, that’s the minimum period for you to be kept in detention, of two years from 27 August 2008 until 26 August 2010. The balance of the term will be two years from 27 August 2010 to 26 August 2012. Have a seat. 30 .Now because the sentence is over three years I make no orders as to parole. HIS HONOUR: Now Mr Modder, Mr Jabakhangi are there any orders, yes first check that my calculations are correct. MODDER: No further orders from the Crown’s point of view your Honour,JABAKHANGI: No further orders from the defence point of view.HIS HONOUR: No further orders. All right. Now Mr Terkmani I’ve got to explain this to you. You’ve got a sentence of four years. It dates from when you were convicted and stayed in custody, 27 August 2008. So your sentence finishes on 26 August 2012. I’ve set a non-parole period of two years. That’s the amount of time you have to spend in gaol. So you won’t be released before 26 August 2010. Whether you’re released or not doesn’t depend upon me, it depends on the Parole Authority when you’re in prison. So when that date is approaching, that is 26 August 2010, they will start thinking about your case and they will determine whether you should be released on parole on that date or not. So the earliest date that you can be considered for parole, eligible, is 26 August 2010. Do you understand that?OFFENDER: Yeah.HIS HONOUR: You do.OFFENDER Yes.HIS HONOUR: Okay. Is there anything else gentlemen? MODDER: No your Honour.JABAKHANGI: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: No, all right thank you, Mr Terkmani can be taken down.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with McCallum J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: I agree with McCallum J. 
     
      
    3 McCALLUM J: On 6 December 2004 the applicant pleaded guilty in the Dubbo Local Court to one charge of attempted armed robbery contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and one charge of aggravated carjacking contrary to s 154C(2) of the Act. The maximum penalties for those offences are, respectively, 25 years and 14 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was committed to the District Court for sentence. On 10 June 2005 he was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) for the aggravated carjacking, to a 3 year fixed term commencing on 23 February 2005 and ending on 22 February 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) for the armed robbery, to a non-parole period of 4½ years commencing on 23 February 2006 and ending on 22 August 2010 with a balance of term of 3 years ending on 22 August 2013, giving a total term of 7½ years .  
        
       
       
      The aggregate sentence was accordingly a non-parole period of 5½ years and a total term of 8½ years.  
       
      
    5 The facts of the offences were that the applicant was sitting outside Dubbo Grove Post Office for some time, apparently contemplating the robbery. He had with him a replica pistol, which he said he regarded as a toy. He believed he received a signal to proceed with the robbery from a young schoolgirl who nodded to him as she walked past the post office. 
     
      
    6 The applicant entered the post office and jumped over the counter onto the teller’s side. The owner of the post office, who was described by the sentencing Judge as “somewhat phlegmatic and courageous, if not foolhardy” told the applicant, when he saw the replica pistol (which he thought was real), that the applicant would be shooting them for “next to nothing”. He said to the applicant “piss off, you are not going to get any money”. The applicant, apparently accepting that he would not be given any money, left the post office. He sought to make his escape by seizing car keys from a woman on the street. The woman fought him for the keys but the owner of the post office came to her aid and pulled her away because he held fears for her safety. The applicant escaped in the car, which he later crashed. He was arrested the same day. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was 35 years old when he was sentenced. He is the second of six children. He was born in Dubbo and raised in that region. The sentencing Judge recorded that he came from a loving, supportive family albeit with some suggestion of violence between his parents.  
     
      
    8 The applicant has spent a good deal of his adult life in prison and told Dr Westmore, a psychiatrist, that he had not been out of gaol long enough to be a “drinker”. He formed a drug dependency, however, at an early age. Dr Westmore diagnosed him as having a drug-induced psychosis with a differential diagnosis of schizophrenic illness. He has an extensive criminal record.  
     
      
    9 The applicant pleaded guilty at an early opportunity. The sentencing Judge applied a 25% discount to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea. The Judge noted the applicant’s extensive and serious record and noted the risk that the applicant has become institutionalised. The Judge noted that the applicant had had many opportunities in the past for rehabilitation and had made no beneficial use of those opportunities.  
     
      
    10 His Honour was invited to make a finding of special circumstances on the basis that the applicant needs residential drug rehabilitation for a prolonged period. He expressly declined to make that finding, apparently on the basis that, whilst he accepted the need for rehabilitation, he did not accept that there was a real prospect of it occurring.  
     
      
    11 The Judge formed the view that the sentences should not be completely concurrent but accepted that there should be considerable overlap between them, having regard to the principle of totality. The two sentences were accumulated by 12 months. The commencement date of the first sentence marked the expiration of an earlier sentence in respect of which parole had been revoked when the present offences were committed.  
     
      
       
      Mental illness  
       
      
    12 The second ground of appeal is that the sentencing Judge erred by failing to give weight to the applicant’s mental illness. It is convenient to consider this ground first.  
     
      
    13 The sentencing judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He did have some mental disturbance at times, not nearly amounting to a defence, but that was, in any event, apparently induced or certainly aggravated by his ingestion of a prohibited substance”. 
        
       
      
    14 Mr Lange, who appeared for the applicant, submitted that the complete absence of any discussion concerning the impact of the applicant’s mental condition on his culpability indicates that his Honour did not attach “sufficient weight” to this consideration. 
     
      
    15 The Crown acknowledged that the Judge’s remarks as to the mental health issue were slight, but submitted that it was not established that the offence was caused by the applicant’s mental illness. 
     
      
    16 The evidence before the sentencing Judge as to the extent to which the applicant’s mental illness caused the commission of the offence was unclear. That causal relationship must be established before the Court can conclude that an offender’s moral culpability is lesser by reason of mental illness. The applicant’s assertion that he thought the young school girl was giving him a signal to rob the post office is some evidence of such a causal relationship but the applicant did not give evidence at the hearing to confirm that statement. It came from the history given to Dr Westmore.  
     
      
    17 Dr Westmore’s report was admissible to prove the facts related to him by the offender (s 60 of the Evidence Act 1995; R v Welsh (1996) 90 A Crim R 364), but the sentencing Judge was not obliged to place any great weight on evidence in that form. Further, Dr Westmore noted in his report that the applicant had also said that on the day of the incident “I was on speed, I started spinning out, hearing voices.” He had also taken four Aropax tablets on that day. Accordingly, the extent to which the offences were caused or contributed to by drugs rather than mental illness was unclear.  
     
      
    18 In any event, the existence of a causal relationship between a mental illness and the commission of an offence does not automatically produce the result that the offender will receive a lesser sentence.  
     
      
    19 The existence of the mental illness was also a factor which may have moderated the consideration of general deterrence, as was the prospect that a custodial sentence may weigh more heavily on a mentally ill person: R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228. However, a counter-veiling consideration is the level of danger the offender presents to the community. The sentencing Judge plainly had regard to that factor, as expressed in his finding that the applicant did not have good prospects of rehabilitation.  
     
      
    20 The weighing of all those considerations was a task for the sentencing Judge in the exercise of his discretion. In my view, no error is disclosed.  
     
      
      Ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term  
       
      
    21 The first ground of appeal is: 
     
      
       
        
        “The balance of the term imposed by the sentencing Judge improperly exceeded one-third of the non-parole period, in circumstances where the Court expressly declined to find special circumstances” 
        
       
      
    22 Section 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “44 Court to set non-parole period 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (1) When sentencing an offender to imprisonment for an offence, the court is first required to set a non-parole period for the sentence (that is, the minimum period for which the offender must be kept in detention in relation to the offence). 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).” 
        
       
      
    23 The sentencing Judge expressly declined to decide that there were special circumstances for the balance of term exceeding the statutory proportion of the non-parole period. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not propose to find special circumstances in this case. Whilst he clearly has a need for rehabilitation I see no basis upon which I can legitimately vary the proportions of the sentence to be imposed in order to accommodate real prospects of that occurring. Instead, the simple mathematics of the situation will dictate some adjustment to the sentence to be imposed and those same mathematics provide a sufficient period under supervision”.  
        
       
      
    24 No matter how the sentences are viewed, the balance of term exceeded one-third of the non-parole period. If one considers only the non-parole period set in respect of the sentence for the attempted armed robbery, which was 4½ years, the balance of term should not have exceeded 18 months and the total term should have been 6 years. Taking account of the 12 months accumulation, the aggregate total term would then have been 7 years. If one begins with the aggregate sentence, the non-parole period was 5½ years and the balance of term should not have exceeded 22 months, giving a total term of 7 years and 4 months.  
     
      
    25 Obviously, the outcome is the same if one works backwards from the total term. For the aggregate term of 8½ years, the non-parole period should have been 6 years and 4½ months (instead of 5½ years). Working backwards from the 7½ years imposed for the attempted armed robbery gives 5 years and 7½ months (instead of 4½ years). It follows that the structure of the sentence did not, on any analysis, conform to the requirement of s 44(2). The question is whether the departure was intended.  
     
      
    26 It is clear that the Judge was aware that the sentence had to comply with the statutory ratio unless he made a finding of special circumstances. In that context, it is necessary to consider his Honour’s remark that he did not propose to do so, but “instead, the simple mathematics of the situation” would dictate some adjustment to the sentence and that the “same mathematics” provided a sufficient period under supervision. It is likely that the mathematics to which his Honour was referring was the impact of partial accumulation. There was no other circumstance or aspect of the sentence that could alter the ratio.  
     
      
    27 On that basis, in my view, the most logical interpretation of the remark is that his Honour thought the sentence he was imposing in respect of the attempted armed robbery conformed to the requirement of the statute, but that the application of that ratio to the aggregate sentence dictated a longer balance of term. That follows from the “simple mathematics” that one third of 5½ years is more than one third of 4½ years (the difference being 4 months).  
     
      
    28 The Crown submitted that it is possible his Honour had in mind the fact that the sentence was accumulated on a previous sentence for which parole had been revoked. The commencement date for the fixed term for the carjacking coincided with the expiration of that sentence. Accordingly, although the applicant was arrested on 14 September 2004, he did not start serving his sentences for these matters until 23 February 2005, almost 5½ months later.  
     
      
    29 It is well established that the fact that a sentence is to be accumulated on an existing sentence can amount to a special circumstance warranting a departure from the ratio otherwise required by the statute: see R v Close (1993) 65 A Crim R 55 at 60 per Hunt CJ at CL. That finding would have been open in this case but his Honour did not make it, nor did he record that factor as a reason for any decision: cf s 44(2).  
     
      
    30 The Crown also relied on the Judge’s remarks at the conclusion of the sentence hearing where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         “The intention is that he serve five and a half out of eight and a half. I think those figures work out to that don’t they?” 
        
       
      
    31 Unfortunately, given that those periods in fact represent a departure from the required proportion between the non-parole period and the balance of term, that remark is entirely equivocal as to what his Honour intended.  
     
      
    32 In my view the appropriate starting point is the fact that the Judge expressly declined to make a decision that there were special circumstances for increasing the period under supervision. The obligation to record reasons for such a decision underscores its importance as a premise to the imposition of a longer period of supervision. His Honour was plainly aware of the terms of s 44(2). In the absence of a decision that there were special circumstances, the most likely explanation for the departure from the requirement of that section is that his Honour simply miscalculated the starting point as being 4½ out of 7½ where it should have been 4½ out of 6. 
     
      
    33 It is possible, conversely, that the miscalculation went the other way so that it is the non-parole period, and not the balance of term, that is wrong. However, it is difficult to reconcile that analysis with his Honour’s earlier reference to the “simple mathematics” producing an increased period of supervision. If the starting point was the intended total sentence of 8½ years, those remarks make no sense. I am satisfied that the sentence entailed an error of calculation and that the error lay in overstating the balance of term. 34 That is a purely mathematical error, the recognition of which discloses that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. In my view, the Court should interfere to correct the error by adjusting the balance of term by reference to the aggregate non-parole period of 5½ years referred to in his Honour’s concluding remarks, to give a total term of 7 years and 4 months instead of 8½ years.   
     
      
      Manifestly excessive sentence  
       
      
    35 The third ground of appeal is that the sentence was manifestly excessive. That ground was based on the starting point of a total sentence of 7½ years imprisonment for the attempted armed robbery. However if, as I have found, the sentencing Judge miscalculated the balance of term for that sentence, that is not the starting point.  
     
      
    36 In any event, the submissions on this ground relied heavily on a comparison between the sentence imposed on the applicant and the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 436. Mr Lange, who appeared for the applicant, acknowledged that Henry could not be invoked as a mantra in every case but submitted that it nonetheless provides assistance. In my view, the circumstances of this applicant were quite different from those on which the guideline judgment is based. As acknowledged in the applicant’s submissions, the applicant was not a young person and he had a lengthy criminal history of serious offences. 37 In my view, the sentence imposed was harsh but within the range of the sentencing Judge’s discretion, particularly when the balance of term is adjusted to correct the apparent mathematical error.  
     
      
       
      Orders  
       
      
    38 The applicant’s application for leave to appeal was out of time. During the hearing, the Court indicated that there would be no issue as to granting an extension of time. 
     
      
    39 Since the imposition of the sentences under appeal, the applicant has been sentenced in the District Court for an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm on a fellow prisoner contrary to s 33A of the Crimes Act. On 22 August 2007 he was sentenced for that offence to a non-parole period of 12 months with a balance of term of 12 months. That sentence is to commence on 22 February 2010, 6 months before the expiration of the non-parole period for the present sentences. Since the orders I propose will not interfere with that part of the sentence, it is not necessary to make any consequential order pursuant to s 59 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    40 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (1) that an extension of the time within which to apply for leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      (2) that leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      (3) that the appeal be allowed in part and the sentence imposed by Judge Freeman for the offence of attempted armed robbery varied to a non-parole period of 4½ years commencing on 23 February 2006 and expiring on 22 August 2010 with a balance of term of 22 months expiring on 22 June 2012.

      NON-PUBLICATION ORDER RE IDENTITY OF COMPLAINANT OR ANY FACTS THAT MAY IDENTIFY HER, INCLUDING THE APPELLANT’S NAME 
       
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant was convicted of 2 counts on an indictment. The first count was that between 14 March 2002 and 31 May 2003 he had sexual intercourse with LB, without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting, she then being under the age of 16 years. The second count was that between 2 November 2003 and 11 November 2003 the appellant assaulted LB and at the time of such assault committed an act of indecency upon her, she then being under the age of 16 years. He was sentenced on count 1 to imprisonment for 9 years, with a non-parole period of 6 years. On count 2, he was sentenced to a fixed term of 5 years, which would be concurrent with the sentence on count 1. 
     
      
    2 The complainant is the appellant’s daughter. She was 13 or 14 years of age at the time of the offences. The appellant and his wife separated in 1994/95 and from that time until the allegations were made in 2004 the appellant had regular contact with his children. It was during these periods of contact that the offences were alleged to have occurred. 
     
      
    3 In addition to the evidence of the complainant relating directly to the two counts the Crown led evidence from her alleging other sexual misconduct by the appellant. It was referred to as evidence of the “relationship” between the complainant and the appellant. The complainant said that the appellant had engaged in sexual misconduct with her from when she was aged five or six. She also alleged that in 2003, during a holiday in the Daintree, the appellant had sexually assaulted her in a tent. Apart from evidence of direct physical contact of a sexual nature the complainant also gave evidence that when she was staying with her father he would watch her through a window while she was in the shower. The Crown originally served tendency notices, as required by s 97 of the Evidence Act 1995, in relation to this evidence. However, it was ultimately proffered as “relationship” evidence. Although commonly referred to as “relationship” evidence having regard to the basis for its admissibility, it is more appropriately described as “context” evidence being evidence of the context within the relationship in which the charged act or acts occurred. 
     
      
    4 The offences with which the appellant was charged were alleged to have occurred in his home. The charge of aggravated sexual intercourse involved an allegation that the appellant forced his penis into the complainant’s mouth while she was lying on a lounge and covered by a blanket. The second offence was alleged to have occurred on a night when the complainant and her brother were staying with the appellant and his partner Y. The Crown alleged that the complainant and her brother shared a bed with the appellant. It was alleged that the appellant had placed his penis between her legs and rubbed himself to ejaculation. 
     
      
    5 The charges first came to trial in August 2005. On that occasion the appellant objected to the admission of the “relationship” evidence, and pre-trial rulings to admit the evidence were made. The trial aborted for reasons unrelated to the trial judge’s rulings on that issue. The re-trial was listed before another judge and further rulings were made. That trial also miscarried. 
     
      
    6 The trial which gives rise to this appeal took place in August 2006. Both the appellant and the Crown agreed to be bound by the evidentiary rulings which had previously been made. 
     
      
    7 The evidence of the complainant was in part given by playing the video recording of her interview with the police. She gave additional oral evidence and was cross-examined. The Crown also called evidence from the complainant’s mother and brother and a former partner of the appellant. The complainant’s brother, TB, gave evidence that on one occasion when he and his sister were visiting the appellant he had followed his father outside at a time when his sister was in the shower and had seen the appellant looking at her through the bathroom window. TB also gave evidence about the trip to the Daintree. He said that the complainant had shared a tent with the appellant when they were camping. He gave evidence that he had wanted to share the tent with his father but had been refused permission. Although the appellant’s case was that the siblings had been placed into separate tents because they were fighting, TB denied that this was the case. TB also gave evidence regarding the night that the second offence was alleged to have occurred. He said he had left the complainant and his father alone in the bed. 
     
      
    8 The appellant gave evidence at his trial. He denied the offences. However, he admitted that he had shared a tent with his daughter on the Daintree trip and that both his children had shared his bed on the night when the second charge was alleged to have occurred. There was evidence from the appellant’s partner confirming the appellant’s evidence of the events on the night of the second charge. A further witness gave evidence confirming the appellant’s account of the events on the camping trip.  
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    9 The original notice of appeal raised two grounds. It was firstly submitted that the verdicts were unreasonable and against the weight of the evidence. It was further submitted that the trial judge had misdirected the jury in relation to the number of persons present at the time of the commission of the offences. Subsequently the grounds of appeal were amended to include the following three grounds. It was these grounds which were ultimately pursued in argument. 
     
      
       
        The admission of the evidence of [TB] as “context” evidence resulted in a trial that was unfair. 
       
       
        The admission of the evidence of uncharged acts as “context” or “relationship” evidence resulted in a trial that was unfair. 
       
       
        Her Honour failed to direct the jury that, before they could use the evidence [of uncharged acts] as evidence of tendency, they must be satisfied of that evidence beyond reasonable doubt. 
       
       
      General matters 
       
      
    10 This case again raises the difficulties in relation to evidence of other allegedly criminal acts or inappropriate conduct by a person accused of a criminal offence. The problem usually arises in relation to allegations of sexual assault although it can create difficulties in other cases. The problems were most recently considered by the High Court in a common law context in HML v R [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 245 ALR 204. They were considered by this Court in Qualtieri v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 95; (2006) 171 A Crim R 463. 
     
      
    11 Section 97 of the Act provides the first step in the statutory control on the admission of tendency evidence. Evidence of “the character, reputation or conduct” or “tendency” of a person is not admissible unless notice is given or the court thinks that the evidence would “have significant probative value.”  
     
      
    12 Section 101 provides a further control upon tendency evidence in criminal proceedings. It provides that the evidence “cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant.” These provisions were considered by this Court in R v Ellis (2003) 58 NSWLR 700 (see also Simpson J’s analysis in Fletcher). 
     
      
    13 It is common to find in cases involving allegations of sexual misconduct with a minor that the complainant alleges similar misconduct on other occasions. They have often been referred to as “uncharged acts”, although this label was criticised in HML by Hayne J at [129]; Crennan J at [399]. 
     
      
    14 I understand that it is common, at least in New South Wales, for the Crown to serve a tendency notice in relation to this class of evidence but when, as will almost always be the case, the defendant objects to its admission, the Crown alters course and confines the purpose of the tender to evidence which explains the context of the offences including the nature of the relationship between the accused and the complainant. Whatever be the purpose for which it is tendered the evidence will almost always occasion significant prejudice to an accused. Care must be exercised both as to its admission and, if admitted, the directions given to the jury as to its use. If admitted as “context” evidence s 136, which requires directions to be given with respect to the limited use of the evidence, is engaged. 
     
      
    15 Section 97 has been described as a “purpose” or “use” rule (S Odgers, ‘Uniform Evidence Law’, 7th ed, Thompson Lawbook Co, p 369). This reflects the definition of “tendency evidence” in the Act where such evidence is defined to mean “evidence of a kind referred to in section 97(1) that a party seeks to have adduced for the purpose referred to in that subsection.” Accordingly, whether evidence is admitted as tendency evidence is dependent in a criminal trial, amongst other matters, on the Crown nominating that the purpose of the tender is to prove a “tendency” of the accused. 
     
      
    16 Evidence of the “character, reputation, conduct or tendency” (s 97) of a person may be powerful evidence of that person’s predisposition or propensity to criminal activity, either of a particular kind, and/or, with respect to an identifiable victim. Where the charges are of sexual assault in whatever form, the tendency sought to be proved is appropriately described as the sexual interest of an accused in the complainant. If not tendered as tendency evidence, s 97 and s 101 will not be engaged. However, s 135 and s 137 will be. Notwithstanding the capacity of the trial judge to give the jury clear direction as to how the evidence may be used, or more importantly how it may not be used, the admission of evidence which may tend to prove a relevant tendency of the accused without it being identified as tendency evidence raises questions of considerable difficulty. When evidence is tendered as tendency evidence the protection provided by s 101 is available; but if tendered merely as relationship evidence s 137 provides the discretionary hurdle to its reception. Section 101 operates so that before the evidence can be admitted the probative value of the evidence must substantially outweigh the prejudicial effect. Section 137 is confined to consideration of the probative value as against any unfair prejudice. Evidence which would not pass the test in s 101 may nevertheless be admitted under s 137 notwithstanding its potential prejudicial effect. Protection from that prejudice materialising is then confined to the directions given by the trial judge. 
     
      
    17 The difficulties faced by a court when considering the admissibility of evidence which demonstrates a tendency but where the Crown disavows the tender for that purpose have been discussed in relation to the Evidence Act on a number of occasions. I considered them in Qualtieri where I said at ([80] and [82]): 
     
      
       
        
        “80 To my mind it is essential in any trial where the Crown seeks to tender evidence which may suggest prior illegal acts by the accused, especially where the charges relate to alleged sexual acts, that a number of steps are followed. Although the circumstances of the particular trial may require some modification the relevant steps will generally be - 
         
         
          Identification of the evidence which the Crown seeks to tender and the purpose of its tender. 
         
         
          If the Crown asserts that the evidence is evidence of a tendency on the part of the accused the admissibility of that evidence must be assessed having regard to s 97 and s 101 of the  
         Evidence Act  
         (see  
         R v Fletcher  
         [2005] NSWCCA 338). Ireland J also provides an analysis of the relevant provisions of the  
         Evidence Act  
         in  
         R v AH  
         [(1997) 42 NSWLR 702] at 709. 
         
         
          If the evidence is tendered merely to provide context to the charges which have been laid, it is first necessary to consider whether any issue has been raised in the trial which makes that evidence relevant (see  
         R v ATM  
         [2000] NSWCCA 475 at [72]). In relation to crimes of a sexual nature, particularly involving children, it may be anticipated that lack of complaint or surprise by the complainant may be an issue at the trial. If it is, it will nevertheless fall upon the trial judge to determine whether the proffered evidence should be admitted having regard to s 135 and s 137. Because the evidence will inevitably be prejudicial, great care must be exercised at this point in the trial. 
         
         
          If admitted, the trial judge must carefully direct the jury both at the time at which the evidence is given and in the summing up of the confined use they may make of the evidence. They should be told in clear terms that the evidence has been admitted to provide background to the alleged relationship between the complainant and the accused so that the evidence of the complainant and his/her response to the alleged acts of the accused, can be understood and his/her evidence evaluated with a complete understanding of that alleged relationship. The jury must be told that they cannot use the evidence as tendency evidence.” 
         
        
       
      
    18 I would make one change to this summary. In the third dot point it would have been more appropriate to refer to “whether there is an issue in the trial” allowing for the possibility of an issue not yet “raised” emerging at a later point in the trial process. I continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “82 In the present case, the evidence of which complaint is now made was not the subject of objection at the trial. Perhaps it should have been. At the very least counsel and his Honour should have clearly identified the basis of the tender which, so it now seems, was confined to evidence establishing the nature of the relationship. That evidence of the relationship was relevant to the jury is made plain by defence counsel’s criticism of the complainant’s evidence in her address to the jury where counsel emphasised the lack of evidence of the complainant reporting the appellant’s conduct to her mother or any other responsible adult. However, whether evidence of other sexual activity was necessary or relevant to explain this matter or merely the explanation that her lack of complaint was motivated by fear of the consequences need not be determined. I am not entirely comfortable with the proposition that in order to explain a lack of complaint, evidence of other sexual activity will necessarily be relevant or that its probative value going to the issue of lack of complaint, outweighs the obvious prejudicial value. These matters need not be resolved in this case although they may require attention in other matters when evidence of this character is sought to be tendered.” 
        
       
      
    19 As I have indicated these issues in the common law context were considered by the High Court in HML. In a decision notable for a lack of a common approach to the problems, Hayne J (with whom Gummow and Kirby JJ agreed) confined the admission of evidence demonstrating a tendency to the circumstance where it is probative of a fact in issue. In their opinion the test for admissibility is that provided in Pfennig [1995] HCA 7; (1995) 182 CLR 461. Their Honours were critical of the distinction commonly made between “tendency” evidence and “context” evidence. 
     
      
    20 The view of Hayne J was expressed in the following passage [113]-[116]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Pfennig  
        establishes the rule that governs the admission of evidence that will reveal an accused person's commission of discreditable acts other than those that are the subject of the charges being tried. The rule takes as its premise that evidence of other discreditable acts of the accused is ordinarily inadmissible. The foundation for the rule excluding evidence of other discreditable acts of an accused is that, despite judicial instruction to the contrary, there is a risk that the evidence will be used by the jury in ways that give undue weight to the other acts that are proved. That is why the exception to that general rule of exclusion is drawn as narrowly as it is by  
        Pfennig 
        .  
        It is why  
        Pfennig  
        requires that evidence of other acts may be admitted only if it supports the inference that the accused is guilty of the offence charged, and the evidence of those other acts is open to no other, innocent, explanation. But it also follows from the considerations that have just been mentioned that the exclusionary rule is not to be circumvented by admitting the evidence but directing the jury to confine its uses.  
        
       
       
        
        There are several points to make about attempts to divide the uses to which evidence of other discreditable acts of an accused may be put. The division suggested may be variously expressed, but its general nature is captured by expressions like ""propensity"", ""disposition"", or ""tendency"" on the one hand, and ""context"", ""explanation"", or ""intelligibility"" on the other. There are at least two reasons not to attempt any such division.  
        
       
       
        
        First, it may greatly be doubted that a division of uses expressed in those or similar terms will provide any useful guidance to jurors. The meaning and application of the expressions is anything but readily apparent, even to lawyers.  
        
       
       
        
        Secondly, and more fundamentally, the foundation of the general exclusionary rule is that uses of the evidence cannot be segregated in the manner suggested. The very risk to which the general rule of exclusion is directed is the risk that the evidence will be  
        misused 
        . Judicial directions about use of such evidence have not hitherto been seen, and should not now be seen, as solving that problem. The possible uses to which evidence of other acts (which does not meet the  
        Pfennig  
        test) may be put are inevitably so intertwined that they cannot be sufficiently disentangled to give useful instructions to the jury. And even if the various uses of such evidence could be disentangled, that would leave unaddressed and unanswered the further difficulty that the jury may attach more significance to the evidence of other acts than they should. That is why the solution that has been adopted for so long by the common law, reflected in this Court's decision in  
        Pfennig 
        , is to limit the circumstances in which evidence of other discreditable acts of an accused will be received in evidence.” 
         
        
       
      
    21 Three of the judges, the Chief Justice, Crennan and Kiefel JJ, in HML accepted that the evidence may be admissible to explain the “relationship”, although their reasons for its admission were not entirely consistent. Gleeson CJ said at [6]:  
     
      
       
        
        “Information may be relevant, and therefore potentially admissible as evidence, where it bears upon assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue by assisting in the evaluation of other evidence. It may explain a statement or an event that would otherwise appear curious or unlikely. It may cut down, or reinforce, the plausibility of something that a witness has said. It may provide a context helpful, or even necessary, for an understanding of a narrative. An example is some evidence given in  
        R v Wickham.  
        A female complainant in a child sex abuse case gave an account, directly relevant to a charge, of a sexual encounter she had with her father when she was 14 years old. She said that her father entered her bed, and had sexual intercourse with her. After some brief conversation, they both went to sleep. The father denied that any such event occurred. There was other evidence to show a history of similar sexual activity before the occasion in question. In the absence of that evidence, the complainant's account of what otherwise would have been presented as a single, and apparently isolated, act might have been regarded by the jury as difficult to believe. The complainant expressed no surprise when her father came to her bed. She made no protest. She behaved as though this was a common occurrence. She said that, in fact, it was a common occurrence. If she had not been permitted to say that, her evidence could have appeared hard to believe. To have put her evidence forward as though she were describing an isolated incident would have been misleading, and, it might be added, unfair. Jurors are told that, in evaluating evidence, they should use their common sense and their experience of life. Whether or not expressly invited to do so, jurors are likely to assess competing versions of events or conduct by reference to their ideas of normal or predictable behaviour. In  
        R v Boardman 
         in a passage later cited with approval in this Court, Lord Cross of Chelsea said that there are cases in which to exclude evidence of the kind presently in question would be an affront to common sense. The law must apply a more definite test, but common sense and relevance are closely related. A jury's assessment of some kinds of evidence is likely to be based more upon common sense than upon scientific method.” 
        
       
      
    22 Later, at [24]-[25] the Chief Justice said, in contrast to the view of Hayne J: 
     
      
       
        
        “The  
        Pfennig 
         refinement upon the general principle as stated, for example, in  
        Boardman 
         does not supplant the general principle in all cases of evidence which reveals the commission of criminal offences other than the charged offences. Where evidence of uncharged acts is introduced for the common, and acceptable, purpose of explaining that a complainant, in giving an account of conduct the subject of a charge, is not purporting to describe an isolated event, so that the account of the event may properly be evaluated by the jury, the test to be applied in determining admissibility is whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect. Evidence may have probative value in the assistance it gives in assessing other evidence. What is sometimes called ""relationship evidence"" may have value in this way. So also may evidence of what are sometimes called  
        res gestae 
        . The evidence that was held to be admissible in  
        O'Leary v R 
        , of similar acts prior to and after the events charged, helped to explain or make intelligible the course of conduct pursued.  
         
         
        In a sexual abuse case, a complainant's evidence of uncharged acts, admitted only for the purpose of explaining or making intelligible her account of the charged acts, or to show that she was not purporting to describe an isolated event where otherwise her account may appear implausible, need not offend rules against investigation of collateral matters or impermissible attempts to bolster a witness's credit. It is, however, subject to the general principle concerning probative value and prejudicial effect, and the possible potential unfairness resulting from both form and content earlier discussed may affect its admissibility.” 
        
       
      
    23 Crennan J said at ([431]-[434]; [463]-[467]): 
     
      
       
        
        “As with evidence which is part of a connected series of events considered as one episode, the charges in these cases cannot truly be understood if isolated from the evidence of other sexual misconduct. Acts which are not part of the offences charged may nevertheless be ""closely and inextricably mixed up with the history of the guilty act itself"" or show ""the continuing nature"" of the conduct complained about so that the evidence explains the offences charged. If evidence is confined to the events, the subject of the charges in these cases, that evidence would be ""unreal and not very intelligible"". That gives the evidence of other sexual misconduct a high degree of relevance. 
         
          
         
        Commonly enough, it will not be feasible to include all incidents of continuing sexual abuse in the charges which are laid in respect of specific acts. Juries understand well enough that sexual abuse of children can involve systematic abuse when the child and the abuser are family members. Jurors would find it strange if such evidence were not put before them if it exists.  
         
         
        In these three matters the evidence of uncharged acts was relied on by the prosecution to establish the context in which the charges could be truly understood, so that the charges would not be considered in a vacuum. The context was a sexualised family relationship which was directly relevant to the proof of issues in the cases. In each case that evidence explained, and rendered intelligible, the offences charged. To exclude such evidence as irrelevant would occasion unfairness by requiring each complainant to give an incomplete account of her evidence.  
         
         
        Principal submissions 
         
        Relevance is a necessary but not sufficient condition for admitting evidence which discloses propensity. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        As observed by McHugh J in  
        KRM 
        , numerous examples can be found where ""relationship evidence"" has been admitted which could not have satisfied the  
        Pfennig 
         test.  
         
         
        As already mentioned, evidence of a relationship of mutual antipathy between a husband and wife, respectively the accused and victim, was admitted in  
        Wilson  
        for the purposes of throwing light on the offence of murder with which the accused was charged and to negative a defence of accident.  
         
         
        More particularly, evidence of a relationship between an accused and a complainant has been admitted to prove sexual crimes against young people, including incest. It was thought by at least one writer that when the  
        Makin 
         approach to exclusion was employed there was a ""less exacting test"" for the admissibility of ""relationship evidence"" than there was for similar fact evidence  
        strictu sensu. 
         Whether or not that is correct, the differences between propensity evidence of the kind considered in  
        Pfennig  
        and the evidence of uncharged acts here are easily recognised.  
         
         
        Once a prosecutor demonstrates that the evidence of uncharged acts has a relevance beyond merely demonstrating propensity and disavows use of the evidence as propensity evidence, the test for admissibility is the basic criterion referred to in both  
        Hoch 
         and  
        Pfennig 
        . That basic criterion requires asking whether the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect, whether that is specifically grounded in  
        Boardman 
        , or more generally in  
        R v Christie 
        , a possibility recognised in  
        Markby v R 
        , which first adopted the  
        Boardman  
        test as part of the Australian common law.  
         
         
        The gloss on that basic criterion, imposing a higher standard of probative value, which arose out of the facts in  
        Hoch  
        and  
        Pfennig 
        , and the purposes for which the evidence was led in each of them, has no application to the purposes for which evidence of uncharged acts was led in these three matters.” 
        
       
      
    24 Kiefel J said at ([500]-[502]; [505]): 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view relationship evidence is relevant, but not in a general way and not by way of background or contextual evidence. It is relevant to answer questions which, in cases of the kind under consideration, may fairly be expected to arise in the minds of the jury were they limited to a consideration of evidence of the offences charged. So understood the basis for its admission is not to bolster the complainant's credit. It is relevant to answer questions and thereby rebut or negative an inference which might otherwise be drawn by the jury. In  
        Gipp v R 
        , McHugh and Hayne JJ accepted that general relationship evidence might be admitted for a limited purpose, one which did not rely upon the accused having a sexual interest in the complainant. 
         
         
        Relationship evidence tendered for this limited purpose does not depend, for relevance, upon a question being raised by the defence. Gaudron J in  
        Gipp 
         accepted that issues may arise as to the complainant's lack of surprise or failure to complain, but considered that they could only be raised by the defence. I must respectfully disagree. Gibbs ACJ in  
        Markby v R 
         did not consider that the admissibility of evidence, relevant otherwise than as to tendency or propensity, depended upon the line taken by the defence at trial, that is, whether the accused had raised or disclaimed a particular defence. The position of the defence may not be clearly exposed on cross-examination of the complainant. It may not be until addresses that reliance is placed upon gaps in the complainant's account. Even if the defence eschewed reliance upon what might be drawn from the absence of particular evidence from the complainant, it would not always be sufficient to settle a concern held by the jury. In any event, if it be accepted that the evidence is relevant to meet questions which may be fairly anticipated to occur to a jury, it cannot be seen as dependent upon the course taken by the defence. 
        
       
       
        
        Relationship evidence tendered for the purpose of providing answers to the jury, in the way explained, discloses the other misconduct. It does not, however, involve the use of any tendency of the accused, in the reasoning of the jury, so long as the jury are properly instructed. It will be necessary, where it is relied upon for this limited purpose, for the trial judge to carefully direct the jury as to the use they can make of the evidence. In  
        BRS v R  
        McHugh J acknowledged that a direction may be effective to overcome the potential for prejudice. To achieve that it will be necessary that the jury be told that they must use the evidence only to answer the questions, identified at an early point by the prosecution and accepted as relevant by the trial judge, which are considered likely to occur to them; but that they are not to use it to reason that the accused is likely to have committed the offences. In some cases a trial judge might fairly observe that the reference to other acts, which are likely to be of the same kind as those charged, does not logically prove the prosecution case or enhance the complainant's credit. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Gipp 
        , McHugh and Hayne JJ expressed the view that relationship evidence tendered for the limited purpose did not offend the policy of the law upon which the rule of exclusion is based. I respectfully agree. The direction to the jury prohibits its use as evidence of tendency and it is therefore to be distinguished from other similar fact evidence. In  
        Pfennig 
         it was said in the joint judgment that relationship evidence is a type of propensity evidence. I take their Honours to mean that this is so when it is used as propensity evidence. In that situation it belongs to a special class of circumstantial evidence which may attract the test there propounded. The test applied in  
        Pfennig 
         can have no application to the limited purpose here discussed. It has been assumed that the test did not apply. In  
        Conway v R 
         relationship evidence was considered to fall outside the special rules in  
        Pfennig 
        , because  
        Pfennig 
         dealt with the more difficult and dangerous category of similar fact evidence.” 
        
       
      
    25 It is of significance that Kiefel J rejected the proposition that relationship evidence was admissible to bolster the complainant’s credit (see to the contrary Howie J in Qualtieri at [119]) but held that it is admissible to rebut “an inference which might otherwise be drawn.” 
     
      
    26 Heydon J said at [271]: 
     
      
       
        
        “For a long time, with few exceptions, on a charge against an accused of committing a sexual crime against a particular victim, the courts have admitted evidence of uncharged sexual acts by the accused against that victim. Thus in 1861 in  
        R v Jones 
         evidence of uncharged rapes by a father of his daughter was admitted to establish a ""reign of terror"" causing the daughter not to resist. This idea is among those which have been employed more recently. Sometimes the evidence has been admitted independently of the principles regulating similar fact evidence. At other times the evidence is said to be admitted in conformity with those principles.” 
        
       
      
    27 His Honour did not find it necessary to determine whether the evidence could be admitted to explain the “relationship.” 
     
      
    28 Whatever be the position under the common law, the accepted position in New South Wales is that evidence of “relationship” may be admitted unless excluded after consideration has been given to s 135 or s 137 of the Evidence Act: Qualtieri; R v AH (1997) 42 NSWLR 702; R v Fraser (NSWCCA, unreported, 10 August 1998). However, it will only be admissible if it is relevant because it may assist in the evaluation of other evidence going to a fact in issue. In particular it may provide the “context” in which to understand a narrative in the sense suggested by Gleeson CJ and Heydon J in the passages above. Unless the other evidence in the trial and the issues which it raises make it relevant to prove the “context” in which the alleged offence or offences occurred, it will be almost inevitable that the discretion should be exercised to exclude the evidence. In most cases relevance will be occasioned by an apparent lack of complaint by a complainant whose will has been overborne from a young age or who has feared the consequences of making a complaint about a family member. Fear of not being believed or family breakdown may explain a lack of complaint when a charged act occurs. If the evidence is admitted the dangers of its misuse are significant and the judge’s directions to the jury must be clear so that the jurors understand the limited purpose for which they may consider that evidence. 
     
      
    29 In Qualteri at [112] this Court emphasised the necessity for a trial court to ensure that it critically analyses attempts by the prosecution to tender evidence otherwise than as tendency evidence. It must again be emphasised that it is not relevant merely because it discloses aspects of the relationship between an accused and a complainant. There must be an issue which the evidence may explain or resolve by placing the alleged events in their true context. 
     
      
    30 The need for care in identifying the basis upon which the evidence is admitted, either tendency or context, must be emphasised. In HML, Gummow, Kirby, Hayne and Keifel JJ state (see Hayne J at [247]) that where evidence is tendered to prove a propensity, being the sexual interest of an accused in a complainant, the jury must be told that they must be satisfied of that interest beyond reasonable doubt (see also Howie J in Toki [2000] NSWSC 999; (2000) 116 A Crim R 536; R v Hagerty [2004] NSWCCA 89; (2004) 145 A Crim R 138; Gipp at [76]; R v TAB [2002] NSWCCA 274; R v RNM [2005] NSWCCA 396. In MM [2000] NSWCCA 78; (2000) 112 A Crim R 519, this Court divided on the question). The four members of the High Court who reached this conclusion may not be entirely consistent in their reasoning (see Kirby J at [61] and Keifel J at [505]-[506]) and HML was decided having regard to the common law. However, unless after full argument of the issue this Court or the High Court says otherwise, this Court should accept that in sexual assault cases the appropriate standard of proof of tendency evidence is beyond reasonable doubt.  
     
      
    31 Context evidence does not require a direction that it be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Where the evidence is of similar sexual misconduct but the jury are told it has only been admitted to explain aspects of the relationship and they may not use the evidence to reason toward guilt, the expectation that they will understand and remain faithful to the direction may not be on firm ground: see Kirby J in HML at [57]. To be told that the accused did the same thing on a number of other occasions but that you cannot use that evidence to reason that he did it on a particular occasion is contrary to ordinary human experience (see the discussion by Debelle J in R v M, RB [2007] SASC 207; (2007) 172 A Crim R 73 at [63] ff). The jury must be left in no doubt that they cannot follow that line of reasoning. The risk in a particular case of an impermissible course of reasoning by the jury which cannot be averted by directions must be a consideration when determining whether the evidence should be admitted.  
     
      
       
      The disputed evidence 
       
      
    32 As I have indicated the disputed evidence was the subject of objection at an earlier trial. The judge at that trial described the evidence in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The first uncharged act the crown seeks to have admitted in evidence is alleged by the complainant to have occurred when she was aged five or six years. That is in the years 1994 or 1995. This event is described in the ERISP at question 241 and following. 
        
       
       
        
        In summary the incident occurred at the accused’s then house at Killarney Vale before she had moved with her mother and brother to Queensland. The event was described by the complainant in some detail. It occurred during the course of an access visit by the complainant and her brother. She said at bedtime the accused carried her young brother, who was then aged two or three, to the top bunk in what I understand was the children’s bedroom.  
        
       
       
        
        The complainant went to bed in the accused bed. She described in some detail an act of cunninglingus performed by the accused. She recalled his movements and her actions after the event including going to the toilet, getting a towel and wiping her vagina and changing her clothes. She said she returned to the bottom bunk in the children’s bedroom.  
        
       
       
        
        There is clearly a gap between this event and the first of the counts in the indictment, which is alleged to have occurred in 2002 or 2003. This leads to the second series of uncharged events upon which the crown seeks to rely. In respect of this period the crown seeks to adduce evidence contained in the ERISP at question 397 to 398 after the complainant had given her account of the incident when she was aged five or six.  
        
       
       
        
        The following exchange took place in the ERISP, and I quote:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Q397: Okay, all right, okay. So any other questions, Danielle? Okay, all right. [LB], so you’ve told me about the first time when you were 5 or 6 and you’ve told me about the last time which was in...last year 2003. So what about the times in between, were there times in between or something else? 
           
          A: Yeah, it happened every time that I’ve been with my dad at night-time, so I can’t remember every time, but I can remember he always used to watch me in the shower.  
           
          A: ...up the back and say, ‘When you have a shower, I’ll just go feed the dog.’ He used to look at in the bathroom window because it never really closed properly.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q398: Mm-mm? 
           
          A: ...so he used to and the screen was gone, he used to be able to open it just enough so he could see me in the shower when the shower curtain was clear and it had see through dolphins or whales on it.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        I was informed by the learned crown prosecutor that the complainant’s brother [TB] would also give evidence concerning his observations of the accused when he saw him on tiptoe looking through the bathroom window, as described by the complainant.  
        
       
       
        
        At the time of these events the complainant said she was visiting her father every second weekend. At question 423 the following exchange took place:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Q: Okay, all right, so you said that something happened with dad every time you went there every second weekend? 
           
          A: Yeah.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q424: And then you moved to..? 
           
          A: To Queensland, yeah. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q426: Three or four years ago so up until the time you were 5 or 6 until 3 or 4 years ago when you went to Queensland you would see your dad every second weekend? 
           
          A: Yeah.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        At question 442 the following exchange took place: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘...so you’ve told me that every time you’ve seen your - seen Dad like every second weekend and you’ve said that something would happen? 
           
          A: Yeah.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Q443: Is there within that time frame first of all of your visiting dad every second weekend, can you remember another specific time when something has happened? 
           
          A: Yeah, I can remember how he always used to come to my room before he started work and went to work on a Saturday because he’d start early. He used to come in and pretend he was hugging me and just rub his penis on my vagina.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        After the complainant, her brother and mother moved to Queensland she said that access occurred two or three times a year. On one of these occasions the accused travelled to Queensland for the purpose of access with a friend by the name of [DG].  
        
       
       
        
        The complainant said that the accused and [DG] took the complainant and [TB] camping to a place called Cape Kimberley. She placed this event in the September school holidays in 2003. This event is described in the ERISP at questions 554 to 669. She described in some detail an act of cunninglingus by the accused whilst she was alone in a tent with him.  
        
       
       
        
        I interpolate at this point the crown pointed out that it did not propose to lead evidence of the complaint pursuant to s 66 of the  
        Evidence Act.  
        However, if such issue arose she would seek to lead evidence of complaint made to her boyfriend under s 108. The events that occurred, to which reference has been made when camping with the accused, was one of the issues raised as an uncharged act which the crown seeks to rely upon. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Nicol on behalf of the accused submitted that the evidence in relation to the occasion of cunninglingus when the complaint was five or six years of age was too remote from the counts in the indictment, being some eight years earlier to the first count in the indictment, and accordingly was of little probative value and unfairly prejudicial to the accused.” 
        
       
      
    33 The judge who made the evidentiary rulings acknowledged that the Crown did not rely on the “uncharged acts” as tendency evidence. Instead the Crown relied upon it as evidence of the “relationship” between the appellant and his daughter in the sense considered by the High Court in Gipp v The Queen [1998] HCA 21; (1998) 194 CLR 106 (see also R v Fraser). Because the Crown said that it did not tender the evidence as evidence of tendency consideration of its admissibility was confined to s 135 and s 137 of the Evidence Act. His Honour determined that although the events when the complainant was five or six years of age were remote from the charges on the indictment, when coupled with the evidence of continued misconduct there was “a continuity demonstrating a relationship”. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Although, of course, there is prejudice which would flow to the accused by the admission of such evidence, I am of the view that such prejudice can be minimised by a direction to the jury at the time of admission of such evidence of the limited use that can be made of the same. Also, of course, such direction will be reinforced during the final summing-up.” 
        
       
      
    34 With respect to the evidence of the camping trip in Queensland his Honour ruled that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Such evidence, not being remote in time in respect the second count, ought be admitted as relationship evidence, demonstrating a continuity of that relationship up until the events comprised in the second count in the indictment, and accordingly ought be admitted.” 
        
       
      
    35 In relation to the evidence of the appellant observing his daughter in the shower his Honour ruled: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view this evidence also ought be admitted as contextual evidence and evidence of the continued relationship that existed between the complainant and the accused.” 
        
       
      
    36 The nature of the evidence and his Honour’s rulings reveals the difficulty that is often encountered by trial judges when evidence of uncharged acts are sought to be relied upon by the prosecution as probative of guilt. It is correct that each of the events if true forms part of the “relationship” between the appellant and the complainant. But that is not the touchstone for admissibility. There must be an issue in relation to the charged act or acts which justifies the admission of evidence of other events including other occasions of sexual abuse. Unless there is such an issue the evidence of other acts is likely to only be admissible, if at all, as tendency evidence. It is true that the evidence of the early incidents and the incident in the Daintree were evidence of events which had occurred in the relationship between the appellant and the complainant. However, only if that evidence assisted in explaining the context within the relationship in which the charged acts occurred could it have been relevant. So far as I understand the reasoning of the judge who admitted the evidence his Honour was content to accept that merely because the evidence told of events in the relationship, even if unrelated to the particular charges, it should be admitted. He did not ask, as he should have, “to what issue in the trial does the evidence go” and in light of the answer to that question determine its admissibility after also considering the probative value and any potential unfair prejudice (s 135 and s 137). 
     
      
    37 It will be obvious that to determine the probative value of any evidence the issue or issues of relevance must first be identified. The evidence of the sexual assault of the complainant at a young age was of events which allegedly occurred approximately eight years before the charged acts. The trial judge did not identify, beyond saying that it formed part of the “relationship”, why the evidence should be admitted. It may, if this was a significant issue in the trial, have been relevant to explain a lack of resistance by the complainant or her lack of complaint in relation to the charged acts. However, the possibility of the jury reasoning from this evidence to the guilt of the accused was high. Before the evidence could be admitted consideration of the issues arising under s 137 was required. 
     
      
    38 The offences with which the appellant was charged allegedly occurred in 2002 and 2003. The events in the Daintree allegedly occurred at about the same time. Those alleged events made no relevant contribution to the context of the charged events. The complainant did complain about the alleged assaults to her boyfriend in February 2004 and participated in an ERISP in July 2004. The Daintree evidence was merely evidence of another occasion on which an assault occurred. There was no issue at the trial justifying its admission. 
     
      
    39 The evidence of the appellant viewing the complainant in the shower could never have been described as “relationship” or “context” evidence. This was effectively conceded by the Crown at the original voir dire hearing. It was evidence which would previously have been described as “evidence of a guilty passion.” It was undoubtedly tendency evidence. Because there was no issue which justified the admission of the evidence as relationship evidence and it was not proffered as tendency evidence it should have been rejected. 
     
      
    40 The difficulties which the admission of the evidence gave rise to is confirmed by the subsequent course of the trial. 
     
      
    41 After the jury had heard the recording of the complainant’s interview the trial judge gave them the following warning which is in conventional terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury, during the playing of that recorded interview you heard evidence of alleged misconduct by the accused on other occasions other than the two counts on the indictment. Now ordinarily it is not permissible to lead evidence of other alleged acts of misconduct. In the present case, that evidence was admitted to put the alleged acts relied upon by the Crown in context. It is admitted solely for the purpose of placing the evidence of the particular acts relied upon by the Crown to prove the charges in the indictment into a true and realistic context. Otherwise you might wonder about the likelihood of apparently isolated acts occurring suddenly and without apparent reason. 
        
       
       
        
        You must not use the evidence of those other alleged acts of misconduct as establishing a tendency on the part of the accused to commit the offences of the type charged. It cannot be used as an element in the chain of proof of the alleged offences charged. You must not substitute the evidence of those other alleged acts of misconduct for the evidence of the specific offences charged. You must not reason that because the accused may have done something wrong to the complainant on another occasion, that he must have done something wrong on the occasions that are charged. 
        
       
       
        
        Before you can convict the accused in respect of either count on the indictment, you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that those particular offences have been proved to be committed. Now, can we have the complainant brought back in please?” 
        
       
      
    42 The address to the jury of both the prosecutor and counsel for the appellant were relatively brief. The prosecutor told the jury that the Crown case depended very much on the evidence of the complainant. Early in his address he reminded the jury that the Crown does not have to prove every piece of evidence to the high standard of beyond reasonable doubt. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “So the Crown doesn’t have to prove to you beyond reasonable doubt that [the complainant] was sexually interfered with when she was five and six, that she was interfered with every Saturday morning. That she was interfered with on the camping trip. That she was watched by her father in the shower.” 
        
       
      
    43 Later, in his address he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The other support, and it depends on whether you’re prepared to give the evidence or not, comes of course from [TB]. Specifically he gives evidence of his father standing outside the window while [the complainant was] in the shower and that supports what [the complainant] says happened on many many occasions. 
        
       
       
        
        Again you may be prepared to make some allowance for [TB]. Remember again he was 14 giving evidence. He’s going back to events when he was aged only about 11. He’s a bit confused. I can’t reconcile the differences in his evidence. You wouldn’t be able to either. Confused about when things happened, he thought things happened on the first night whereas everybody seems to be saying it happened on the last night. He thought the championship went for four weeks, it went for only about half that. He thought there were a couple of dogs out there, there would seem maybe only one. Lots of things that you may not be able to accept so far as [TB’s] evidence is concerned. The major thing of course is that he initially told the police when he was talking about what happened, and bear in mind that this is some 12 months after when the police first speak to him, that his father was standing on tippy toes and then when he was asked questions about that he said he was actually standing on a white chair. It’s a matter for you, you might say ‘Well we just can’t accept [TB], can’t accept any of his evidence.’ Again, as I said, matter for you but if you get to that stage ‘No we can’t accept [TB] at all’ then that’s not favourable to your acceptance of the evidence of [the complainant]. Maybe dad was standing on his tippy toes, maybe dad was on a chair. [The complainant’s] evidence was that the shower screen wasn’t up, shower curtain, I should say, wasn’t up the whole time, that it changed and at different stages there were shower curtains that you couldn’t necessarily see through. 
        
       
       
        
        It may be, and maybe I’m drawing too long a bow and you may not be prepared to accept this theory at all but it may be that the accused was getting himself up to a height where he could look down over the shower curtain but as I said, what you make of [TB’s] evidence is entirely a matter for you. If you do accept that dad was out there when [the complainant] was in the shower, then that’s supportive of [the complainant]. 
        
       
       
        
        The one thing that I would suggest to you is very supportive of [the complainant] and it may well determine how you’d come back with your verdicts, is what you make of the camping trip. Now the evidence of the camping trip and the Saturday mornings and what happened when she was five and six and the shower is all led as contextual evidence so that you’re not asked to consider the two charges on the indictment in a vacuum and asked to accept that just out of the blue one night when they were in the lounge room, the accused has tried to put his penis in her mouth, you would find it very difficult to accept that that just happened out of the blue or that in bed one night he rubbed his penis in and out between her legs. So it’s put before you so you can understand these two charges against the background of what [the complainant] says was a sexual type relationship that went on between her father and herself over a period of years and her Honour has given you some warnings about what you can make of that and what you can’t do with that particular evidence and she’ll reiterate that for you in the course of giving you the directions at law. But you are entitled to look very carefully at the camping trip and you’re entitled to make up your minds about what happened on that camping trip. Bearing in mind that the Crown doesn’t have an onus to prove beyond reasonable doubt but if you’re satisfied and accept what [the complainant] says happened on the camping trip, then that would make the rest of her evidence more credible and conversely, I would suggest to you, it would totally undermine the credibility of the accused and make it very difficult for you to believe his evidence.” 
        
       
      
    44 At a later point he referred to the evidence about the trip to the Daintree. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I said, if you accept what [the complainant] says in relation to the camping trip, then converse to finding her credibility bolstered is that you have grave difficulty accepting what the accused had to say. It totally undermines his credibility, I would suggest to you. 
        
       
       
        
        At some stage when I was asking questions you recall he had difficulty remembering the ages of his children and yet he can tell you in great detail what happened each day of the holidays. 
        
       
       
        
        Only a small thing and what you make of it, it’s a matter for you of course but he originally said in his evidence that apparently [Y] was the one that suggested that the children come and get into bed with him. He maintained that when I first started asking questions in cross-examination, then he was saying he actually heard what was said, changed his tack. He said he heard it because it was coming from the lounge room. [Y] doesn’t support him, she says that she had a conversation with the children in the bedroom where they were. 
        
       
       
        
        His version is that on that camping trip, [TB] was scared of the Cassowaries and the noises in the bush. He’s supported in that by [DG]. It was put to [the complainant], she didn’t accept it all, she didn’t say that he slept in the vehicle. 
        
       
       
        
        The one person who it wasn’t put to, you might remember, is [TB]. [TB] wasn’t asked in cross-examination whether he was scared of the Cassowaries. He also wasn’t asked whether he slept in the vehicle. 
        
       
       
        
        At the end of the day, I would suggest to you, that you would reject the evidence of the accused. You have difficulty with the fact that both he and [Y] seemed to mirror image the evidence that they give. It’s almost like they were working off a script, they could both remember pretty much exactly the same things. That’s not something that will concern you so far as [the complainant] and [TB] is concerned, you wouldn’t think for one minute that they’ve got their heads together but it would cause you some concern when you assess the credibility and the evidence that’s given to you by the accused and [Y].” 
        
       
      
    45 It is apparent from these remarks that although the Crown Prosecutor had tendered the relevant evidence as “relationship” evidence, rather than confine its significance to providing a context for the complainant’s evidence in respect of which it was not suggested that there was a relevant issue, he told the jury that it could use that evidence to undermine the appellant’s credibility generally. Although, if there was an issue which justified such an approach, it may have been permissible to seek to persuade the jury that the evidence of other sexual activity placed the charged acts in context, making the complainant’s evidence in the absence of complaint more credible, the reality was that the prosecutor sought to persuade the jury that it could use the evidence of sexual activity on other occasions to be confident of the appellant’s guilt of the acts with which he had been charged. This is tendency reasoning: Qualtieri [120]. 
     
      
    46 The position was not assisted by the submissions of defence counsel. Although he accepted that evidence of the earlier acts could be confined to evidence of the “relationship”, it was otherwise in relation to the Daintree incident. With respect to that matter although he argued that the jury should find that the event did not occur, he accepted that it was so closely related in time to the charged acts that the jury would be entitled to reason that if they accepted the Daintree incident did occur the appellant was more likely to be guilty of the charged acts. This also is tendency reasoning. Counsel said to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “Now then you’ve got a number of counts which the Crown says are relationship or contextual evidence and her Honour will give you directions that you don’t decide those counts, they’re there to put his relationship with his daughter in context and so you don’t come to a determination her Honour will say, in respect of those counts. It’s only the counts on the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        But if I could take you to the Queensland and the last count. The Queensland incident. In my submission to you that they are so intertwined, they’re so close in time that if you don’t accept the evidence of one you wouldn’t accept the evidence of the other because you see, the Crown asked you to, this is what the Crown asked you to accept that [the complainant] went on holidays with her father and [DG] to Cape Kimberley, and remember my questions in cross-examination, I said to her, ‘Look your allegations are that there’d been a, up until this stage, and this is, I think September 2003, there’d been a history of sexual molestation yes and you suspected that something would occur while you were on holidays with him?’ ‘Yes.’ And in fact your allegations are it did occur and she said ‘Yes’ but, and then despite that you have the evidence of the video. ‘This is the best holiday I’ve ever been on.’ Now the Crown says ‘Well what she did through the day was great and she had a lot of fun but it was at night.’ Would you accept that. This young lady gave evidence that she was sexually molested every night at the camp site in the Kimberley. Not just one occasion but every night, that’s seven days, I’m sorry, seven nights. That’s her evidence, up there for seven nights. Every night. On the last night is the night, she says this, the last night she had consumed some alcohol. Now if the father was a sexual predator and wanted to get her drunk and all the rest, had his way with her, why wouldn’t he do that the first night, the second night, the third night, the fourth night, the fifth night, the sixth night and the seventh night. No, there’s no evidence of that, no alcohol consumed until the last night but she says ‘On that night I was drunk and I was sick and I went to bed early and she gives specific vivid, horrendous detail of what she said occurred but when she was asked what occurred on the earlier nights, ‘I was just sexually assaulted, he just assaulted me.’ ‘What did he do’? ‘Just assaulted me.’ 
        
       
       
        
        There’s no detail of those nights but the very night she’s intoxicated, so intoxicated, she’s had so much to drink she vomits. But she gives all this specific detail and yet the detail of the other nights and it was open for the Crown to call all that and she was asked about it and she gave no detail, other than the fact, ‘Oh yeah he just assaulted me.’ It just doesn’t ring true. You probably all had a few to drinks or you’ve seen someone who over imbibed. The next night, or the next day you ask them questions or people ask you questions what happened and then just some things you just can’t remember but she remembers this in vivid detail. She says ‘Look I went over to my father’. There’s no disagreement of that ‘And we lay head to toe and he pulled me up on top of his body’ and he’s put to a position where her vagina was in his mouth and she stayed there for half an hour with not one word of protest. Just use your commonsense about that. Not one word. She didn’t even try and wriggle off or anything. For half an hour, about half an hour she said but it’s the very next day in the morning before they leave, she turns the video recorder on herself and says ‘It’s the best holiday I ever had’. I just ask you to use your commonsense. After this horrendous night, this horrendous seven nights, she’s turned the video on herself and said ‘It’s the best holiday I’ve ever had’. The Crown tries to say ‘Well gosh almighty, before she’s only had a day here and a couple of days here at Dreamworld, not bad, Dreamworld and some other place and this was long holiday that she’s had but what as she has described could never be in anyone’s wildest imagination be described as the best holiday anybody ever had yet these are the words that she used when she videoed herself in the presence of [DG] and her father. The best holiday, I’d hate to see the worst. But that’s what she says and that’s not forced upon her. There’s no evidence that that was forced, they were standing over her Say that on the video, that’s her spontaneous reaction. The day after this horrendous assault. But you see that’s only part and parcel of it. Then her father takes her home and there’s not a word said to the mother or [K] but we find out that within three weeks [the complainant] has come to the Central Coast and if you accept the accused’s evidence and [Y’s] evidence, she rings the father. She goes then, the father and [Y] go and pick up her up and [TB]. Just think about it. The young lady is 14 at the time. What would be the last thing you’d want after that holiday in the Daintree, Cape Kimberley. You wouldn’t want to see it again. You would recoil from the very very thought of this particular man but no we don’t have that. She goes and she stays with him and we learn one version, it’s the first night, on the other version it’s Sunday night and the other version it’s a Monday night. It’s for you to satisfy yourself which night it is but all the evidence is that four went into bed together. ..(not transcribable).. it was of the invitation apparently of [Y] but it doesn’t matter whose invitation it was, they were all there together. Now after what had happened in Queensland, the last place in the world you would be would be jumping into the same bed as your father, wouldn’t you? Why would you get in with him but in any case if you did get in and you feared the worst, because remember she said ‘He started to cuddle me before [Y] got out’ and I think she said ‘I started to go to sleep’ but then [Y] gets out and says ‘It’s too squashy’. Wouldn’t commonsense dictate that if [Y] got out you’d be using the same excuse. Why would you want to be, why would you want to remain beside the man who’s committed these horrible things upon you in the Daintree?” 
        
       
      
    47 In the course of her summing-up the trial judge indicated that she would not summarise all of the evidence. The trial was relatively short and her Honour was of the opinion, correctly in my view, that the evidence would be fresh in the jury’s mind. 
     
      
    48 Her Honour proceeded to warn the jury that because only two persons were present on the occasions of the alleged offences they may be tempted to regard their task as choosing between their competing versions. Her Honour told the jury that they should be mindful that their task was to determine whether the Crown had proved each element of each charge beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    49 With respect to the “relationship” evidence her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I told you during the trial, in addition to the evidence led by the crown, specifically directed to the particular counts in the indictment, the crown has led evidence of other acts of alleged misconduct by the accused towards the complainant. 
        
       
       
        
        They were incidents which are said to have occurred when the complainant was five or six at …., in the early hours of Saturday mornings at …. when the accused was working overtime, and he would go into [the complainant’s] bed and rub his penis between her legs, instances of watching her whilst she was showering at …, and the incidents which are said to have occurred on the camping trip. 
        
       
       
        
        I shall refer for the sake of convenience to those matters as evidence of the other alleged acts. 
        
       
       
        
        It is important that I remind you of the warning I gave you during the trial, and to once again explain the relevance of the evidence of those alleged other acts. 
        
       
       
        
        That evidence was admitted solely for the purpose of placing the evidence of the particular acts relied upon by the crown to put the charges in the indictment in a true and realistic context. It is confined in other words to making the circumstances of the particular offences charged more intelligible. 
        
       
       
        
        As I told you, otherwise, you may [wonder] about the likelihood of apparently isolated acts occurring suddenly without any apparent reason. 
        
       
       
        
        If a complainant gave evidence of isolated acts of sexual misconduct a jury would be entitled to say to themselves, as persons of commonsense, well really it is very odd for there to be such isolated acts between these two persons, thus it is open to the crown to lead evidence of other alleged acts of a sexual nature between the accused and the complainant, and I have already referred you to the relevant evidence given in this case, in that regard. 
        
       
       
        
        However, I must give you certain important warnings with regard to this evidence of other acts, which we can conveniently refer to as context evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        You must not use this evidence of other acts as establishing a tendency on the part of the accused to commit offences of the type charged. Therefore, it cannot be used as an element in the chain of proof of the offences charged. You must not substitute the evidence of other acts for the evidence of the specific offences charged. You must not reason that because the accused may have done something wrong to the complainant on other occasions, he must have done so on the occasions charged.” 
        
       
      
    50 After giving these directions her Honour proceeded to further discuss the “other acts.” Although she told the jury that the evidence could not be used as establishing a “tendency” or as “an element in the chain of proof” she proceeded to give the jury directions as to the weight to be given to this evidence. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “You must give careful consideration to the time frame in which the other acts are alleged to have occurred. The more remote the alleged sexual activity is, the less weight it is given. When you are considering the weight to be given to the evidence of the complainant about the … incident when she was five or six, you must remember, that at the time of that alleged misconduct, she was aged between five and six. And that is something which may affect the reliability of her evidence about that incident.” 
        
       
      
    51 In giving this direction her Honour was following the guidance given by the model direction in the Bench Book which I approved in Qualtieri (at [81]). The emphasis in the Bench Book on the care required when allegations of sexual misconduct at a time remote to the charged acts is made was probably included as a consequence of the remarks of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Beserick (1993) 30 NSWLR 510 (see 521-522). His Honour was writing in the context of the common law and the impact of the Crime (Sexual Assault) Amendment Act 1981. His Honour used the expression “relationship evidence” to describe evidence of “sexual desire” as well as evidence which placed a charged incident into its “true and realistic context.” It was in relation particularly to the former which Hunt CJ at CL directed his remarks about remoteness and the diminishing weight of the evidence. 
     
      
    52 Although the Bench Book has maintained this as an appropriate direction in relation to context evidence it has a capacity to mislead trial judges. It remains the case that the more remote in time from the offence charged less significance will attach to evidence of other sexual acts. If admitted as tendency evidence a caution as to the reliability of evidence remote to the acts charged is necessary. However, if the evidence is tendered only for the purpose of proving the context in which the offence occurred, if a caution was thought to be necessary the almost inevitable result will be that the risk of prejudice occasioned by the jury misusing the evidence would outweigh its probative value. In this event having regard to s 137 the evidence should be rejected. There may be cases where the evidence is properly admitted as “context evidence” and a caution is required. However, they will be rare. 
     
      
    53 It may be that because of the real risk that judges will be deflected from a proper consideration of the admissibility of evidence pursuant to s 135, the Bench Book direction should exclude reference to the caution. In the unlikely event that evidence remote in time is admitted, careful attention must be given, as with any case, to the appropriate directions. 
     
      
    54 The trial judge continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Her evidence of what she says took place in more recent times however, does not attract such a warning, except for her evidence as to what took place on the last night of the camping trip. You have heard evidence that she was intoxicated. On her evidence she consumed four Vodka Cruisers, and six Dark and Stormy rum drinks. On the evidence of the accused, and DG she consumed four Vodka Cruisers and perhaps one Dark and Stormy rum drink. 
        
       
       
        
        The fact that she was so intoxicated that evening to the point where, on all of the evidence, she was vomiting, that may be something which affects the reliability of her evidence about that incident, and once again you need to scrutinize her evidence with great care before you rely on it, because of that circumstance.” 
        
       
      
    55 Although objection was originally taken to the admissibility of the evidence no difficulty was raised with the address by the prosecutor and no complaint was made following the judge’s summing-up. For the reasons I have indicated it should have been.  
     
      
    56 Although her Honour told the jury that the evidence was admitted solely for the purpose of placing the evidence of the particular act relied upon in a true and realistic context it did much more. The jury was told that they might otherwise view the charged acts as isolated and occurring without any reason but it is not apparent that this was an issue in the trial.  
     
      
       
      The proviso 
       
      
    57 It follows that the evidence to which objection was taken should not have been admitted at trial. Furthermore, the submissions of counsel and the directions of the trial judge demonstrate the error in admitting the evidence. This Court has an obligation to ensure that if a person is convicted he or she has been tried fairly and according to law. The appellant is entitled to be tried in relation to evidence which was properly admitted and dealt with in accordance with the Act. This did not occur. This is a case where it would be inappropriate to consider whether the conviction should remain undisturbed without the disputed evidence (see AK v Western Australia [2008] HCA 8; (2008) 232 CLR 438 at [23], [54] and CTM v The Queen [2008] HCA 25 at [120] ff where Kirby J who dissented in the result discussed the relevant principles). That evidence would plainly have been of considerable significance to the jury when determining whether to accept the complainant’s account of the circumstances relating to the offences charged and reject the appellant’s evidence. The convictions must be quashed. A new trial should be ordered. 
     
      
       
      ORDERS 
       
      1. Appeal upheld. 
       
      2. Conviction quashed. Remit the matter to the District Court for a new trial. 
       
      
    58 HIDDEN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    59 FULLERTON J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

     PETER BRAUN v REGINA 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    2 HALL J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal under s.5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in respect of sentences imposed upon him by the District Court of New South Wales on 25 July 2008. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was charged and pleaded guilty to six counts under s.1041G of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) as well as to two counts under s.300(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). In other words, the applicant pleaded guilty to six Commonwealth offences and two State offences. 
     
      
    4 The sentences imposed were in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
      (1) For each of the offences under s.300(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
      , a fixed sentence of nine months imprisonment, to be served concurrently, to commence 25 July 2008 (the  
      “Crimes Act offences” 
      ). 
       
       
      (2) In respect of the six offences under s.1041G of the  
      Corporations Act 
      , a term of imprisonment for a period of three years, to be served concurrently, and to commence on 25 October 2008, the applicant to be released after two years and two months on 24 December 2010 (the  
      “Corporations Act offences” 
      ). 
       
      
    5 The Crown submissions noted that the total effective sentence was three years and three months imprisonment, the applicant to be released on a recognisance on 24 December 2010. 
     
      
    6 At the hearing of the application for leave to appeal, Mr David Robinson SC, who appeared with Mr Jacob Horowitz of counsel, drew the Court’s attention to the fact that the way in which the sentencing judge framed the sentences for the Crimes Act offences and the Corporations Act offences left open the interpretation that the sentences imposed resulted in a total effective non-parole period of two years and five months imprisonment, this being upon the basis that the Corporation Act offences were to commence on 25 October 2008 and not 25 July 2008. The State offences were stated as commencing on 25 July 2008. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    7 In the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal, filed on 8 September 2008, the applicant stated that he relied upon the following grounds of appeal:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The sentences and the non-parole period imposed upon the Applicant were manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The sentencing judge was in error in concluding that there was no alternative to full-time custody permitted by law. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The sentencing judge failed to properly assess the objective circumstances of the offences. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The sentencing judge failed to take proper account of the applicant’s subjective circumstances. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The sentencing judge failed to apply  
        Pearce v The Queen 
         (1998) 194 CLR 610.” 
        
       
       
      The relevant provisions 
       
      
    8 Section 300(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) is in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        300 Making or using false instrument 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A person who makes a false instrument, with the intention that he or she, or another person, will use it to induce another person:- 
         
         
          
          (a) to accept the instrument as genuine, and 
          
         
         
          
          (b) because of that acceptance, to do or not do some act to that other person’s or to another person’s, prejudice,  
          
         
         
          
          is liable to imprisonment for 10 years.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    9 Section 1041G of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) is in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        1041G Dishonest conduct 
        
       
       
        
        (1) A person must not, in the course of carrying on a financial services business in this jurisdiction, engage in dishonest conduct in relation to a financial product or financial service. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) In this section:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          dishonest 
           means:- 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) known by the person to be dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    10 The sentencing judge was, accordingly, required to determine the sentence to be imposed under two relevant sentencing regimes, namely, Part 1B of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) and the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW). 
     
      
       
      General sentencing principles in relation to the s.1041G offences 
       
      
    11 The sentencing judge was required in relation to these offences to have regard to the provisions s.16A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) which is in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “16A Matters to which court to have regard when passing sentence etc. 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (1) In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (2) In addition to any other matters, the court must take into account such of the following matters as are relevant and known to the court: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           (a) the nature and circumstances of the offence; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) other offences (if any) that are required or permitted to be taken into account; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (c) if the offence forms part of a course of conduct consisting of a series of criminal acts of the same or a similar character - that course of conduct; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (d) the personal circumstances of any victim of the offence; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (e) any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (f) the degree to which the person has shown contrition for the offence: 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              (i) by taking action to make reparation for any injury, loss or damage resulting from the offence; or 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           (ii) in any other manner; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (g) if the person has pleaded guilty to the charge in respect of the offence - that fact; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (h) the degree to which the person has co-operated with law enforcement agencies in the investigation of the offence or of other offences; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (j) the deterrent effect that any sentence or order under consideration may have on the person; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (k) the need to ensure that the person is adequately punished for the offence; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (m) the character, antecedents, age, means and physical or mental condition of the person; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         (n) the prospect of rehabilitation of the person; 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (p) the probable effect that any sentence or order under consideration would have on any of the person’s family or dependants.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    12 In general terms, the determination required of the sentencing judge, in respect of each of the Corporation Act offences charged, was to ensure, having regard to the above provisions, that the term of imprisonment reflected all of the circumstance of the offences and of the offender, including, in particular, their objective gravity and the need for general deterrence. These matters operate to confine the proper range for the exercise of the sentencing discretion: Regina v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704 at [65].  
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    13 A Summary of Facts was tendered and marked as Exhibit A at the sentencing hearing. Attached to that document was a statement by the applicant dated 8 November 2007. 
     
      
    14 There was also in evidence an affidavit of the applicant affirmed on 11 June 2008 and he was cross-examined on that affidavit at the hearing. 
     
      
    15 The applicant is presently 31 years of age. He was born on 13 February 1977 in what was then known as Czechoslovakia and came to this country when he was about 11 years of age. 
     
      
    16 After completing his high school education, he attended university and in 1999 completed a Bachelor of Economics degree and in 2002 received a Master of Economics (Economics and Finance). 
     
      
    17 He worked with a well-known company in the financial industry between about June 2000 and July 2002. On the latter date, his employer company relocated to Hong Kong. 
     
      
    18 In May 2004, he was introduced by a former school friend, a Mr Gara, to a Mr Gregory Nathan. Mr Nathan introduced himself as a director of a company, Fundamental Group Pty Limited (“Fundamental”). 
     
      
    19 In due course, Mr Nathan told him that he was looking for “a share trader”. The applicant told him that he was interested in moving into the share trading area. 
     
      
    20 In May 2004, he commenced working with Fundamental on a full-time basis. He was paid on a commission basis which the applicant estimated on average earned him approximately $20,000 per year. He said that, given his low income, he was required to live on credit. 
     
      
    21 On commencing work with Fundamental, Mr Gara gave him a list of clients. 
     
      
    22 The applicant stated that, despite a promise made by Mr Nathan at a meeting in May 2004, he was not provided with any training at Fundamental. 
     
      
    23 In about May 2004, Fundamental developed the Individually Managed Account (“IMA”) as a retail product for investors. The purpose of the IMA was to enable an investor to provide funds to Fundamental which would be used to invest and trade in a portfolio of shares specifically tailored to that investor’s needs. The IMA was to be managed by a share trader and the applicant undertook this role between 2004 and October 2006. 
     
      
    24 The individual investors in the IMA were located by Mr Gara. 
     
      
    25 Exhibit A lists the names of the investors and the amounts invested by each. Omitting the names of the individual investors and substituting numbers for the purposes of identification, I set out the particulars in Exhibit A as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Investor 1 invested $150,000 on 25 August 2004 
        
       
       
        
        Investor 2 invested $155,000 on 30 August 2004 and $100,000 on 24 January 2005 
        
       
       
        
        Investor 3 invested $118,020 on 15 October 2004 
        
       
       
        
        Investor 4 invested $60,000 on 12 November 2004 
        
       
       
        
        Investor 5 invested $250,000 on 18 January 2005 and $98,000 on 25 May 2005 
        
       
       
        
        Investor 6 invested $150,000 on 8 February 2005 and $39,700 on 18 March 2005 
        
       
       
        
        Investors 7 invested $91,103.34 on 5 August 2005.” - s.300(1)  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 offences) 
        
       
      
    26 The evidence, accordingly, indicates that a total of $1,211,823.34 was invested in the IMA by the above investors in the period 25 August 2004 to 5 August 2005. 
     
      
    27 The applicant, in his capacity as a share trader, managed the relevant accounts on behalf of the investors. 
     
      
    28 As adverted to above, he was paid solely on commission, being a percentage of the initial investment made in the IMA. He was also to receive a commission if his trading significantly outperformed the ASX 300. 
     
      
    29 In order to effect the trades, the applicant would make contact with Craig Maltz, broker at Tricom Equities Limited who would undertake them on the applicant’s instructions through Tricom Equities. 
     
      
    30 In the period between June 2004 and October 2006, the applicant performed hundreds of trades. However, the intention of outperforming the AXS 300 was not realised and the IMA began to lose money. It is said that this trend continued through to October 2006. 
     
      
    31 In relation to the six counts of dishonest conduct charged under s.1041G of the Corporations Act the following particular facts were established. The applicant was required to report to the investors about the trades he had performed for them and how their investment was performing in general. He did this by providing to the individual investors “Individually Managed Account Portfolio Valuation Reports (“Portfolio Valuation Reports”). 
     
      
    32 In the period between July 2004 and October 2006, he sent many such reports to them. He also sent reports to Mr Gara knowing that they would be sent on to investors. False reports were received by each of the investors identified as Investor 1 to Investor 6 above. 
     
      
    33 The stated amounts in each Portfolio Valuation Report were false in that they overstated the value of the investments. The securities listed and their quantities were also false. In his statement of 8 November, being part of Exhibit A, the applicant stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “20(d) I knew, at the time of sending the Portfolio Valuation Reports to each investor, that the stated value of the investment was false; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) I knew that the securities listed, as being held in the investor’s name, as at the date of each Portfolio Valuation Report, and the quantity of those securities was false; 
        
       
       
        
        (f) I knew that by sending the Portfolio Valuation Reports, that contained the false information to the investor I was acting dishonestly.” 
        
       
      
    34 In his affidavit affirmed on 11 June 2008, the applicant stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “39. I relied heavily upon Mr Maltz to guide me in stock selections, although I appreciate that the decision to invest in a particular stock was ultimately my own. My reliance on Mr Maltz was due to him holding himself out as being experienced, and secondly due to me being new to trading and not being mentored by anyone at Fundamental. 
        
       
       
        
        40. With hindsight, I regard Mr Maltz to have encouraged me to trade excessively and I suspect that this may have been due to the commissions that Mr Maltz and Tricom earned on the trades that I did. I estimate the total trading fees generated from me during my time at Fundamental exceeded $400,000.” 
        
       
      
    35 In relation to the false statements made to the investors, the applicant stated in his affidavit:- 
     
      
       
        
        “48. As stated above, I have pleaded guilty to providing false statements to investors of Fundamental, which I appreciate involves conducting myself in a dishonest manner. 
        
       
       
        
        49. Essentially, I gave investors information that would have given them the impression that their investments were doing much better than they in fact were doing. 
        
       
       
        
        50. I did this out of a sense of fearing failure. 
        
       
       
        
        51. The situation that I found myself in at Fundamental was that I had been given the ability to trade in other people’s money and that no-one kept any checks on me. Although I traded poorly, the superiors at the organisation did not call me in and provide an appraisal of my performance or otherwise seek to uncover the errors with my trading strategies. 
        
       
       
        
        52. From a personal perspective, and given my ambitions to succeed in a financial career, I wanted to be successful at Fundamental. To me, my success would be measured by me providing a good return on the funds invested with Fundamental. 
        
       
       
        
        53. When I started to lose money for my investors, I panicked. I did not know what to do. I did not want to tell the investors that I had done badly. Further, I wanted to be able to right the situation. I was convinced in my own mind that if I could have more time I could turn things around. 
        
       
       
        
        54. It was against this background that I committed my offences. I should have just told the investors that I had lost part of their funds. However, my own anxiety at failing my clients drove me not to do this. I did not engage in the conduct the subject of these proceedings directly for the purposes of my own financial gain, rather, I was giving myself time to succeed at what I was trying to do – recoup the losses.” 
        
       
      
    36 In cross-examination, the applicant stated that he approached his director once or twice concerning share values and at least on one of those occasions, he made him aware that there had been “one big share loss”. 
     
      
    37 The cross-examination included the following:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Do you agree that shortly after you commenced the share trading on behalf of the clients the subject of these charges, your share trading for those clients was producing losses? 
         
        A. Yes. Initially when I started this, the stocks I selected started to lose their values over a period of time, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That was one of the reasons why you created the false documents, if I can put it that way, so that the clients would not also become aware of the fact that they were losing in their investments? 
         
        A. Yes 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You accept, don’t you, that in your role you were in a position where you were required to put your clients’ interests ahead of your own in terms of the share trades that you were going to carry out? 
         
        A. Yes, in my role the client came first, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But that’s not what ultimately happened here, is it? 
         
        A. My interests were first. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You sought to disguise the fact that your share trades on behalf of the clients were making a loss? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you put your interest in hoping to make a profit in the long run ahead of the clients’ immediate interests to make an informed choice? 
         
        A. Yes, the clients were losing the monies in the share portfolio, so, yes, I was hoping that I could make the money back.” 
        
       
       
      Findings 
       
      
    38 The written submissions for the applicant set out the facts as found by the sentencing judge. The Crown accepted that they accurately record the relevant findings and accordingly, I reproduce paragraph [7] of those submissions:- 
     
      
       
        
        7. For present purposes, the sentencing judge’s findings were as follows:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) The conduct under s1041G was the composing and sending of false reports to each of 6 investors in respect of their share trading position. [Remarks, p.3] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) The conduct under s300(1) was the making and sending of two groups of false instruments purporting to evidence transactions undertaken on behalf of a certain investor [Investors 7]. [Remarks, p.4] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) The Applicant held two university degrees [Remarks, p.6.5], but had previously not worked in a trading position. [Remarks, p.6.8] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) The Applicant was given no training. He relied upon others, such as Mr Maltz at Tricom Equities, to guide him in stock selections. [Remarks, p.7.2] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) The Applicant had no real supervision in his job and did not tell any of his supervisors that the share trading was going badly. [Remarks, p.5.5] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) The Applicant did not tell the directors of his employer that the shares he was trading in were falling in value. [Remarks, p.5.6] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) The amount invested by the individuals named in all the counts totalled $1,211,823.34. [Remarks, p.2.3] These funds were kept in a single account which the Applicant used to trade shares. [Remarks, pp.2.2 & 3.2] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (h) The Applicant’s conduct caused persons to lose very large sums of money. [Remarks, p.9.5] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (The sentencing judge did not set out the sum lost. From Exhibit A in the sentencing proceedings, his Honour may have had in mind the figure of $838,270, although this figure requires refinement (discussed further below). From other parts of the Remarks, it appears that the sentencing judge accurately identified the relevant loss as the loss of opportunity for investors concerned by the actual trading results to withdraw from the investment in a timely and informed way and thereby limit the losses incurred. [Remarks, p.8.7]) 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) The sentencing judge found that  
          [Investors 7]  
          money was lost. The finding was that ‘… $100,000 in each case … was lost’ [Remarks, p.11.2] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (j) The dishonest conduct was carried on over a two year period. [Remarks, p.8.6] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (k) The dishonest conduct was motivated by a perceived need to conceal trading losses after those losses had been incurred. [Remarks, pp.7.4 & 5.6] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (l) Each of the s300(1) offences was very serious and involved very careful preparation. [Remarks, p.11.2] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (m) The Applicant was paid solely by commission on initial investment and then further commission if he outperformed the ASX 3000. [Remarks, p.2.8] He earned about $20,000 a year and lived off credit cards. [Remarks, p.7.1] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (n) The Applicant did not make anything personally from his dishonesty, although he did intend to get commissions if he was successful. [Remarks, p.5.9] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (o) The Applicant assisted ASIC in its enquiries and set out his dishonesty in detail. [Remarks, p.4.5] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (p) The Applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. [Remarks, p.11.1] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (q) The Applicant had no criminal records. [Remarks, p.8.9] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (r) The Applicant was remorseful. [Remarks, p.8.9] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (s) There was considerable reason to suppose that the Applicant will not involve himself in this type of thing again. [Remarks, p.8.9] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (t) The Applicant was of previous good character. [Remarks, p.9.1] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (u) The Applicant was young [aged 28] and foolish at the time of the offences. [Remarks, p.8.6] 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (v) The Applicant as a result of his work was unable to sleep and suffered from a condition known as psoriasis. [Remarks, p.7.6]” 
          
         
        
       
      
    39 In this appeal, it is necessary to consider, firstly, whether there are any errors of fact or principle that could vitiate the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. Secondly, whether the sentencing judge was correct in concluding that the only appropriate sentence was a full-time term of imprisonment. Thirdly, whether, if a full-time term of imprisonment was appropriate, whether the sentence imposed lies within the range of a sound discretionary judgment. In this latter respect, the question is whether or not the sentence was manifestly excessive as contended by Mr Robinson SC on behalf of the applicant. 
     
      
       
        
       
      Submissions for the applicant 
       
      
    40 The written submissions on behalf of the applicant dated 8 September 2008 address the following grounds of appeal:- 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The sentences and the non-parole period imposed upon the applicant were manifestly excessive 
       
      
    41 It was contended in the written submissions for the applicant that, what was said to have been an effective total sentence of three years and three months with a minimum term to be served of two years and five months, is outside the range for the offences in question. Particular reliance was placed upon the fact that the Corporations Act offences did not involve a finding that the dishonest conduct had been undertaken for personal financial gain or for the gain of an entity associated with the applicant. In this respect, it was emphasised that the case was not one involving larceny, misappropriation or false statements made “… to cover up otherwise dishonest activity” (paragraph [10]). It was contended that the activity covered up was the applicant’s poor performance in trading shares, this being an activity which had been undertaken honestly. 
     
      
    42 The question raised by Ground 1 will be separately considered later in this judgment. At this stage, it is sufficient to state that I do not accept this submission as accurately characterising the applicant’s conduct. The suppression of the true position concerning the investors’ share portfolio and the issue of false Portfolio Valuation Reports to them hid and misled the client investors from knowing the true position concerning their investments. I do not accept that the relevant “activity” of the applicant was merely to disguise or cover up his “poor performance in trading shares”. I will return to the dishonest nature of the applicant’s conduct below. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The sentencing judge was in error in concluding that there was no alternative to full-time custody permitted by law 
       
      
    43 In the written submissions, attention was given to the Remarks on Sentence at pp.10 to 11.1. The relevant passages at those pages contain the sentencing judge’s observation that s.17A of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) required him to refrain from imposing a sentence of imprisonment unless there was no other course available. His Honour there stated his belief that in the circumstances there was no other course available and that this was in accordance with what had been stated by “… the higher courts in this State …”. 
     
      
    44 The sentencing judge also stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… however, the deliberateness of these offences, even taking into account that he co-operated with the authorities and pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity, leaves me no other options.” 
        
       
      
    45 It was contended on behalf of the applicant that the sentencing judge’s conclusion in this respect was erroneous and that his Honour failed to refer to any authority to support his conclusion. 
     
      
    46 It was submitted that his Honour’s remarks at p.10 of the Remarks on Sentence, in which there was reference made to sentencing decisions concerning insider trader offenders, to offenders who had defrauded companies and to offenders who had been in dereliction of their duties as directors, suggested that the sentencing judge had in mind cases such as Regina v Adler [2005] NSWCSC 274; (2005) 53 ACSR 471; Regina v Williams [2005] NSWSC 315; (2005) 216 ALR 113; Regina v Cooper [2006] NSWSC 609; (2006) 58 ACSR 83; Regina v Fodera [2007] NSWSC 1194; (2007) 65 ACSR 109; Regina v Cassidy [2005] NSWSC 410 and Regina v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7; (2004) 59 NSWLR 284. I will deal with specific authorities of this Court in the later discussion in this judgment. 
     
      
    47 It was further contended that the cases relied upon by the Crown before the sentencing judge all involved far more serious offences than those committed by the applicant. In this respect, it was stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “20. The common theme running through all of the above cases relied upon by the Crown (as specified in paragraph 19) is the misappropriation of substantial sums of money. As the instant case ‘is not a case of misappropriation’ (Remarks, p.9.5), the above cases could not stand as authority for the proposition espoused by the sentencing judge that the law did not permit him to impose anything less than a sentence of full-time custody on the Applicant.” 
        
       
      
    48 In the Crown’s written submissions (paragraph [14]), it was stated that although this case was not one involving misappropriation, the applicant nonetheless stood to gain in other respects including:- 
     
      
       
      (1) His reputation – that the conduct created the impression that he was successful in his chosen profession and enabled him to continue working as a share trader. 
       
       
      (2) Enabled him to continue to trade in an attempt to recoup the money lost and make gains which would ultimately result in a commission to him. 
       
      
    49 The Crown contended (paragraph [23] of the written submissions) that the authorities that consider the principles applicable to sentencing offenders for white collar crimes where a position of trust has been abused were the authorities cited by the Crown to the sentencing judge. The submission was that such authorities may make it clear, in the absence of exceptional features, that ordinarily such offending calls for full-time custodial imprisonment to be imposed in cases of a single offence. In this case, the Crown argued there was nothing exceptional. 
     
      
    50 The Crown also contended that the submissions for the applicant ignored “the gravamen and purpose of these offence provisions”. In that respect, it was contended that the offence provisions “… are targeted at ensuring that persons in the position of the Applicant act honestly in carrying on their business. That applies whether or not the person gained financially from the conduct. The clients are entitled to rely on that honesty. They are dependent on it. As demonstrated here, the consequences can be devastating” (written submissions, paragraph [16]). 
     
      
    51 It is clear from the Remarks on Sentence that the sentencing judge specifically considered the issue as to whether there was available a sentencing option other than full-time imprisonment. I consider that in concluding that the offences charged required a full-time custodial sentence and that no other sentencing option was available in the circumstances of the case, the sentencing judge did not fall into error. The basis for my conclusion in that respect is set out later in this judgment (paragraphs [80] to [86]). 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The sentencing judge failed to properly assess the objective circumstances of the offences 
       
      
    52 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that there were a number of discrete errors in assessing the objective circumstances of the case. These may be summarised as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That the sentencing judge erred when he said the offences occurred over a two year period when, in fact, they occurred over a 14 month period between 28 July 2005 and 6 October 2006. I do not consider that it has been demonstrated that any discrepancy in this respect had any relevant effect on the sentences imposed. 
       
       
      (2) In relation to the statement by the sentencing judge that the applicant did not tell any of his superiors about the poor share trading performance, it was contended that the reference to  
      “supervisors” 
       and to  
      “directors of the company”  
      overlooked the fact that the organisation was not a large one and that the applicant only dealt with one person, Gregory Nathan. It was contended that these statements by the sentencing judge indicated that he had formed the view that the applicant misconducted himself by keeping his employer in the dark regarding his share trading losses. However, it was stated that there was other evidence that Mr Nathan received a copy of each trade by email and that the operation of the nominee account required his signature and approval. Additionally, reliance was placed upon the applicant’s evidence that he would send a copy by email to the director on each trade. I do not consider that this matter in any way undermines the dishonesty repeatedly perpetuated by the applicant. 
       
       
      (3) That the sentencing judge incorrectly concluded that the investors concerned in the offences under s.300(1) (Investors 7 referred to in paragraph [38]) had suffered a loss of their money. The submission was that there was no evidence that those persons lost any money, let alone  
      “$100,000 in each case” 
      , it being observed that they together had only invested $91,103.34. I will return to this aspect below. 
       
       
      (4) That the sentencing judge did not find, but should have found, that the entire deficit of $838,270 set out in Exhibit A did not arise as a direct result of any dishonest conduct by the applicant but rather as a result of his unsuccessful share trading combined with associated brokerage commissions and that such commissions were of the order of $400,000 or more. The evidence on these matters was before the sentencing judge and, in light of the submissions made to him I do not consider that there is any reasonable possibility that his Honour was unaware of them. 
       
       
      (5) That the sentencing judge failed to consider the significance of the compensation scheme set up under s.917B and s.885C of the  
      Corporations Act 
      , that being an integral part of the licensing scheme. The submission was qualified by the observation that it was not suggested that the availability of the compensation scheme directly affected the culpability of the applicant but that, without further evidence, his Honour could not have said, as he did, that  
      “(t)he consequences for the investors really has been quite disastrous” 
       (Remarks on Sentence, p.8.5). The evidence established that substantial losses resulted from the applicant’s conduct. I do not consider the matter raised could, in any way, diminish the level of culpability that was determined by his Honour. 
       
      
    53 In the Crown’s written submissions, it was contended that there had been a proper assessment of the objective circumstances of the offences. In particular, regard had been had to the length of the offending, the specific nature of the applicant’s role, his control of the share trading and reporting, the planned and organised deception and ultimately what is termed the significant loss suffered by the investors. 
     
      
    54 It was submitted that the learned judge correctly found that the applicant had not informed his supervisors or the directors that the shares he was trading were falling in value. In that respect, the Crown relied upon the evidence of the applicant in cross-examination. 
     
      
    55 It was further contended that the sentencing judge had been correct in his observation that the consequences of the applicant’s conduct to the investors had “really been quite disastrous”. 
     
      
    56 I do not consider that material errors as claimed in paragraphs [52](1), (2), (4) and (5) has been established. The objective circumstances of the offences are set out and discussed in paragraphs [75] to [78] inclusive. They were matters identified by the sentencing judge and no failure has been demonstrated in his Honour’s assessment of them. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: The sentencing judge failed to take proper account of the applicant’s subjective circumstances 
       
      
    57 The submissions for the applicant drew attention to the fact that the applicant had no prior offences and was a person of good character and accepted responsibility for his actions and had expressed remorse. 
     
      
    58 Reference was also made in this context to the sentencing judge’s remarks as to the applicant’s motivation and to his dishonesty (Remarks on Sentence, p.7.4). However, criticism was directed to the fact that the findings made as to the motivations for the dishonest “… does not equate to the failings of others who had the benefit of decades of business experience and an extensive network of potential support around them” (Applicant’s written submissions, paragraph [37]). 
     
      
    59 As to the subjective factors, the Crown referred to what it contended was the attempt by the applicant to minimise the offending on the basis that he was 28 years of age at the time of the offences and did not have substantial business experience or an extensive network supporting him. This, it was contended, ignored the nature of the offending and the position of trust which the applicant held. 
     
      
    60 Raising another basis of alleged error, the applicant argued that the sentencing judge gave no explicit discount based on the early plea of guilty in accordance with Regina v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. 
     
      
    61 The Crown’s contention was that the sentencing judge was not required to explicitly quantify the discount for the plea of guilty: Regina v Mo [2007] NSWCCA 61; (2007) 169 A Crim R 60; RE v Crown [2005] NSWCCA 429. The Crown, accordingly, contended that the failure to do so was not an error of law and, furthermore, it could not be inferred that the plea of guilty had not appropriately been taken into account. In this respect, the Crown pointed to observations made in the course of giving reasons which indicated that the sentencing judge was conscious of the fact that the applicant had “… pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity …”. Further, it was said in submissions, that the sentencing judge was taken to the appropriate authorities. 
     
      
    62 I identify the relevant subjective circumstances in paragraph [114] below. His Honour identified each of these circumstances in his remarks on sentence and I do not consider that error has been established in respect of the assessment made of them. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The sentencing judge failed to apply Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 
       
      
    63 His Honour referred to the two sentencing regimes under which he was proceeding and to the principles enunciated in Pearce (supra) in the context of the imposition of sentences for each of the six Corporations Act offences and the appropriate sentences to be imposed in respect of the two Crimes Act offences. 
     
      
    64 A reading of the remarks on sentence reveals that the approach taken by his Honour involved the following elements:- 
     
      
       
      (1) A determination by him that the two  
      Crimes Act offences 
       should attract fixed concurrent sentences of nine months imprisonment to commence on 25 July 2008 and to expire on 24 September 2009. 
       
       
      (2) That the sentences to be imposed in respect of the  
      Corporations Act offences 
       were to be partly cumulative, the term of imprisonment to commence on 25 October 2008 and to expire on 24 October 2011. 
       
       
      (3) That there was to be a  
      “non-parole period” 
       of two years and two months to commence on 25 July 2008 and to expire on 24 December 2010. (This third remark, understandably, gave rise to confusion. A non-parole period of two years and two months commencing on 25 July 2008 would expire on 24 September 2010. A non-parole period of two years and five months, however, if commencing on 25 July 2008 would expire on 24 December 2010.) 
       
      
    65 The remarks on sentence make it clear that the sentencing judge had well in mind the relative seriousness between the State and Federal offences and that distinction is reflected in the sentences imposed. It is equally clear that his Honour was mindful of the fact that he was required to impose a sentence for each individual offence and as well that he was required to apply the principle of totality. I do not consider that it is correct to say that his Honour only had in mind the total effective sentence to be imposed, an approach the High Court noted in Pearce (supra) as one likely to mask error (at p.624).  
     
      
    66 In relation to sentencing in respect of the Corporations Act offences, his Honour stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “If I, for example, impose a sentence of six months imprisonment on each and cumulated each that would result in a sentence of three years and six months 
         [sic] 
        . But to say that each of these offences warranted only a six month period of imprisonment would seem to me to undervalue the seriousness of the offence. At the same time I do not think that any greater overall period for those six offences should be imposed than three years. Therefore, I have decided that in relation to those matters I will impose a sentence of three years imprisonment in relation to each of those six offences but make those sentences concurrent, because the overall period that he should serve for that should be no longer than three years.” 
          
        
       
      
    67 Although his Honour identified the principles to be applied, including in particular, those in accordance with Pearce (supra), I accept, as was submitted by Mr Robinson for the applicant, that his Honour did not, in fact, apply the principle by determining “… an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of cumulation or concurrence as well as, of course, questions of totality”: Pearce (supra) at 624. Whilst his Honour did, of course, consider and apply principles relating to accumulation and concurrence and of totality, he was required to determine the sentence for each of the six Corporations Act offences. 
     
      
    68 The failure to determining a sentence in respect of each offence in accordance with Pearce (supra) constitutes an error entitling this Court to intervene: Regina v Lemene [2001] NSWCCA 5. 
     
      
    69 I will return to consider the consequence of that conclusion. 
     
      
       
      The Corporation Act offences – whether manifestly excessive 
       
       
      (1) The statutory offence 
       
      
    70 The error identified above in the application of the principles enunciated in Pearce (supra) provides, as I have observed, a sufficient basis for this Court to intervene and to re-sentence the applicant. However, I will nonetheless proceed to examine whether, as alleged, the sentences imposed by the sentencing judge were, in any respect, “manifestly excessive” as contended for on behalf of the applicant. 
     
      
    71 The issue of “manifestly excessive” sentences was, as earlier noted, raised in Ground 1 of the Grounds of Appeal. In the discussion below, I propose to refer to four matters. The first concerns the statutory offence. The second, the objective matters that relate to the gravity of the offences. The third, the full-time custodial order made and, fourthly, the question of whether the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    72 In relation to the Corporation Act offences, it has been observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Part 7.10 of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth) is aimed at protecting the integrity of dealings in Australian primary and secondary financial markets. It does this by creating statutory liability for certain conduct in relation to financial products or services. Conduct prohibited by Pt 7.10 of the Act includes:- 
        
       
       
        
        1. manipulating a financial market; 
        
       
       
        
        2. trading falsely on a financial market; 
        
       
       
        
        3. disseminating statements about the price of financial products affected by prohibited conduct; 
        
       
       
        
        4. making false statements to induce dealings in financial products; 
        
       
       
        
        5. improperly inducing dealings in financial products; 
        
       
       
        
        6. engaging in dishonest conduct; 
        
       
       
        
        7. misleading or deceptive conduct in connection with financial products or services; and 
        
       
       
        
        8. insider trading.” 
        
       
       
        
        The Law of Australia, TLA [4.9.2200] 
         
          
         
        
       
      
    73 Part 7.10 of the Corporations Act, which incorporates s.1041G, forms part of Chapter 7 – Financial Services and Markets. In Part 7.1, s.760A sets out the objects of Chapter 7 in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        760A Object of Chapter 
        
       
       
        
        The main object of this Chapter is to promote:- 
        
       
       
        
        (a) confident and informed decision-making by consumers of financial products and services while facilitating efficiency, flexibility and innovation in the provision of those products and services; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) fairness, honesty and professionalism by those who provide financial services; and 
        
       
       
        
        (c) fair, orderly and transparent markets for financial products; and 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the reduction of systemic risk and the provision of fair and effective services by clearing and settlement facilities.” 
        
       
      
    74 Section 1041G of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth), accordingly, can be seen as one of several provisions in Chapter 7 directed to reinforcing the requirement for integrity in the financial services industry by imposing criminal and civil penalties for conduct which is “dishonest” as defined in the section. 
     
      
       
      (2) The objective factors in this case 
       
      
    75 The objective circumstances that were relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion in the present case were:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That the total sum invested and for which the applicant was responsible was a large one amounting, in all, to $1,211,823. 
       
       
      (2) That the relevant offences extended over a period of approximately 14 months and involved a series of dishonest actions constituting in that period a continuing line of conduct. 
       
       
      (3) That the investors were very much dependent upon the honesty of the applicant. In relation to their respective investments, they were vulnerable in that they were susceptible to being misled by incorrect information and of being duped by dishonest conduct. 
       
       
      (4) That the dishonest conduct of the applicant occurred in the course of a trust relationship with Fundamental’s clients investors and such conduct represented a gross breach of trust. 
       
       
      (5) That the conduct comprised repeated deception, suppression and deliberate misleading of the investors as to the true position concerning their respective investments. 
       
       
      (6) That the applicant’s conduct constituting the  
      Corporation Act offences 
       formed a continuing course of conduct that put the investors’ funds at a significant risk of loss, which loss materialised. 
       
       
      (7) That the applicant was wholly motivated by his own interests at the expense of Fundamental’s investor clients. 
       
       
      (8) That the investors were deceived and were thereby unable to act in their own interests. 
       
      
    76 The matters referred to in the preceding paragraph indicate, in my opinion, that the objective criminality involved in the Corporation Act offences was at a high level. Accordingly, they must be considered to be serious offences. The maximum custodial penalty of five years for an offence under s.1041G is some reflection of the intention of Parliament that offences of this kind are to be so regarded. The circumstances pertaining to the Corporations Act offences, in my opinion, establish a substantial degree of culpability in the applicant. 
     
      
    77 It is true, and I take account of the fact that the applicant was not a senior executive or an employee exercising managerial control. However, in the context of a financial services business dealing directly with members of the public who necessarily place their faith and trust in the officers and employees of such a business, the risk to investors resulting from a breach of trust will usually be equally significant, whether or not the dishonesty is that of a senior executive or that or a subordinate employee. Investors have limited or, in many cases, no opportunity of verifying the truth or accuracy of information provided by those in the business of providing financial services. The vice in the present case was that the false Portfolio Valuation Reports were employed as instruments of deception with the result that the investors in question were not informed of the true facts and were misled and were thereby deprived of the opportunity of protecting their respective financial interests. 
     
      
    78 In the history set out in the pre-sentence report dated 12 June 2008, there is reference to the applicant having highlighted that his relationships with his work supervisor and another colleague were said to be instrumental in his commission of the offences. The applicant stated that he had repeatedly made poor trading decisions based on the advice of another employee, the applicant trusting that employee owing to their past friendship. He further stated that his trading decisions were not being monitored by his supervisor as they should have been and, accordingly, his actions remained unchecked. The report (p.3) records:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… Mr Braun minimised his culpability for the offences by seeking to blame his supervisor, the culture of the organisation, and his own lack of experience for his actions.” 
        
       
      
    79 In Regina v Pantano (1990) 49 A Crim R 328, Smart J at 339 (dissenting, but whose general observation on the position of subordinate employees was not material to the result) stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Dishonesty by those in subordinate positions must be discouraged and the cases stress that the element of deterrence is an important one both for the individual and others who might be tempted to offend. The task is to strike the correct balance between the need for vindication of the criminal law where a position of trust has been abused and the subjective requirements of the accused …” 
        
       
       
      (3) Whether full-time imprisonment appropriate 
       
      
    80 On the question as to whether, in the circumstances of the case, there were alternatives to full-time imprisonment available to the sentencing judge (and on any re-sentencing by this Court), there are four matters to be considered: the nature and number of the offences, the objective gravity of those offences, the importance of general deterrence in sentencing for white-collar crimes and the applicant’s subjective circumstances. 
     
      
    81 On the level of culpability in relation to the Corporations Act offences, the evidence disclosed a deliberate, co-ordinated and recurring course of deception. Whilst the gravity of the offences, as earlier stated, was high, I do not consider that the offences are properly to be classed as the worst type of case. However, the Corporations Act offences in this case do exhibit features that are associated with that worst category. The fact that there was no direct financial benefit, as in cases of misappropriation, is not, in my opinion, to be given the significance contended for in the submissions on behalf of the applicant. The applicant’s non-disclosure by suppression of the true facts and his deception in falsifying facts in the Portfolio Valuation Reports constituted dishonest conduct that produced significant losses to the individual investors. 
     
      
    82 Reference has been made to a number of sentencing decisions involving white-collar crime including Adler (supra); Boulden (supra); Pantano (supra) and Rivkin (supra) amongst others. I have also had regard to the decision of this Court in Boskovitz v The Queen [1999] NSWCCA 437 (Wood CJ at CL, Hidden J and Smart AJ). 
     
      
    83 At pp.11 to 12 of the remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge discussed the comparative seriousness of the Corporations Act offences and the two Crimes Act offences, holding, as I have earlier noted, that the former were the more serious offences. 
     
      
    84 On the question of general deterrence, Wood J (as his Honour then was) observed in Pantano (supra) at p.330:- 
     
      
       
        
        “As was observed in  
        McKechnie 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, 1 October 1987), those involved in serious white collar crime must expect condign sentences. The commercial world expects executives and employees in positions of trust, no matter how young they may be, to conform to exacting standards of honesty. It is impossible to be unmindful of the difficulty of detecting sophisticated crime of the kind here involved, or of the possibility for substantial financial loss by the public. Executives and trusted employees who give way to temptation cannot pass the blame to lax security on the part of management. The element of general deterrence is an important element of sentencing for such offences:  
        Glenister  
        [1980] 2 NSWLR 597; (1980) 3 A Crim R 210.” 
        
       
      
    85 The real bite of general deterrence, it has been observed, takes hold only when an actual custodial sentence is imposed: Regina v Boulden [2006] NSWSC 1274 per Whealy J at [51]. In Regina v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17, Howie J at [29] to [32] observed that the question as to whether any particular sentencing alternative, including a suspended sentence, is an appropriate or adequate form of punishment must be considered on a case by case basis, having regard to the nature of the offence or offences committed, the objective seriousness of the criminality involved, the need for general and specific deterrence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. 
     
      
    86 I confirm the opinion I have earlier expressed to the effect that the matters identified in paragraphs [75] to [81] support the conclusion reached by the sentencing judge, and which should be accepted for the purposes of re-sentencing, namely, that a full-time term of imprisonment for the offences was the only appropriate sentencing option available in this case. 
     
      
       
      (4) Were the sentences manifestly excessive? 
       
      
    87 At the request of the presiding judge, McClellan CJ at CL, the Crown was asked to provide reference to all Commonwealth prosecutions under s.1041G and, in particular, to any sentencing decisions concerning that provision. The Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, by letter dated 6 November 2008, made available to the Court the results of an internal database search. The results in table form set out particulars in relation to prosecutions that have been dealt with in the District Court of New South Wales, the County Court of Melbourne and to the decision of this Court in Higgins v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 38. 
     
      
    88 So far as the decisions of the lower courts are concerned, the Crown referred to the decision of this Court in Rivkin (supra) at [415] to [416]. 
     
      
    89 I am of the opinion that the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge in Higgins (supra) (the appeal against sentence being dismissed) of a sentence of two years’ imprisonment in respect of three offences under s.1041G and the minimum sentence imposed of two years is the only authority that affords any possible guidance for the purposes of the present case. 
     
      
    90 It is clear that, by reason of the fact that the offence created by that section is materially different from other white collar offences, appellate decisions on other such offences in relation to the latter are of limited assistance. 
     
      
    91 However, a review of such decisions can at least provide a background for a consideration of the s.1041G sentences that were imposed in the present case. 
     
      
    92 The relevant case law includes cases that involved dishonest conduct by the making of misleading statements to others. In a number there was no financial benefit to the offender. In Boskovitz (supra), the appellant appealed her conviction by a jury of three counts under s.178BB of the Crimes Act 1900, namely, that with intent to obtain a financial advantage she made a statement which was false in a material particular and which she knew to be false. 
     
      
    93 The appellant was a director and an experienced senior executive of the company and of related companies and she knew the state of the finances of those companies. However, she did not determine the strategies of them and the directing force was a Mr Goldberg who was described as the corporate entrepreneur. The appellant implemented his strategies and directions and those of directors and executives senior to her. 
     
      
    94 In relation the severity appeal, it was noted that each of the offences arose out of the appellant sending certain accounts to banks and making oral and written statements as to those accounts. Credit facilities arranged by her involved large sums of money. She was not acting to secure financial advantage for herself but rather for the companies under Mr Goldberg’s control. She was a salaried employee. 
     
      
    95 Smart AJ at [133] observed that the appellant had an understanding of her duties and obligations which was seriously deficient. She lacked honesty and failed to tell the true story to the banks. It was observed that she was prepared to deceive them and she did so. 
     
      
    96 The appellant had no previous convictions. Her remuneration was modest, having a taxable income in the relevant year of $64,777. She did not receive generous bonuses, shares or options. Her remuneration was found not to match her responsibilities. 
     
      
    97 It was argued on appeal that the sentencing judge had failed adequately to take into account that there was no evidence of any advantage, financial or otherwise, which was received by the appellant as a result of the impugned false statements. 
     
      
    98 Smart AJ observed at [141] that it was not an ingredient of the offence that someone had suffered financial loss or received a personal benefit. It was, however, reasonable to conclude that loss was probably suffered as at least by one bank advanced $10 million. 
     
      
    99 It was clear that the appellant had carried out the principal director’s instructions to maintain credit facilities. On appeal, it was satisfied that the appellant had been “swept along by a dynamic entrepreneur with a dominating personality …”. At [153], his Honour observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “I am persuaded that the sentences do not maintain the right balance between general deterrence and the other features of the case. To reflect the gravity of the offences which are a little below the worst type of cases, a concurrent sentence of 4 years should be imposed on each count with a minimum term of 2 years 3 months. There are special circumstances. These include the appellant’s previous good character, the unlikelihood of further offences and this being the appellant’s first gaol sentence.” 
        
       
      
    100 Their Honours, Wood CJ at CL and Hidden J concurred. 
     
      
    101 In Adler (supra), the offender pleaded guilty to four counts, two of which involved disseminating information knowing it was false in a material particular and which was likely to induce the purchase by other persons of shares in HIH Insurance Limited in contravention of s.999 (repealed) of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cth). 
     
      
    102 Count 1 alleged that the information disseminated was false in a material particular and it was held to be likely to induce the purchase by other persons of shares in HIH Limited, contrary to the above provision. 
     
      
    103 Count 2 involved obtaining money by false or misleading statements contrary to s.178BB of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). 
     
      
    104 In relation to Count 1, the offender disseminated information which he knew to be false, namely, that he had purchased shares in HIH with his own money which information was said to be likely to induce other persons to purchase shares in that company. The sentencing judge (Dunford J) observed that, not only were the statements likely to induce other persons to purchase shares in HIH, but that the offender’s intention was to cause a rise in the share price, as in fact it did. 
     
      
    105 The offender stood to benefit from a rise in the share price in two ways. First, successful trading would enable him to demonstrate, inter alia, to the Board of HIH that he could manage the company’s investments better than the current team and, secondly, it would increase the value of the shares in HIH held by him. At least in the second of these two matters, the potential personal benefits distinguish the case from the present case. 
     
      
    106 On each of Counts 1 and 2, the offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment for two years and six months, the sentences to be concurrent with each other. 
     
      
    107 In Boulden (supra), the offender pleaded guilty to one count of being privy to the fraudulent altering of the books of a company contrary to s.590(1)(c)(iii) of the Corporations Act. The maximum penalty for the offence was a penalty of two years’ imprisonment. 
     
      
    108 The offender had become the Financial Controller of the Corporate and Professional Insurance Division of FAI General Insurance Company Limited. The performance of the insurance operations of the FAI Group steadily deteriorated over a particular six month period. The sentencing judge (Whealy J), stated that the objective criminality involved in the offence was at not an insignificant level, the offender holding a responsible middle management position. In that position, he had a direct capacity to alter the recorded estimates. Although the offender did not stand to gain personally in a financial manner from the creation of the fraudulent document, his moral culpability lay in his inability to refuse to be the architect of the fraudulent alteration. 
     
      
    109 The offender was 42 years of age at the date of sentence and had no prior convictions. 
     
      
    110 Whealy J referred to the importance of the element of general deterrence in white collar crimes, especially crimes such as that committed by the offender “… because of the need to mark out to employees of companies who hold office at the level of seniority of the offender that they have a social and moral obligation, as well as a statutory duty, to act honestly and responsibly. An important reason why this is so relates to the oft- remarked difficulty in detecting and investigating white-collar crime” (paragraph [43]). 
     
      
    111 In that case, having regard in particular to the offender’s strong subjective case, whilst determining that no sentence other than imprisonment was appropriate, the offender was sentenced to a term of 12 months, the sentence to be served by way of period detention. In the course of his remarks on sentence, Whealy J adverted to the circumstance that the offender’s criminal actions were taken at the prompting, invitation or direction of others more senior in the organisation. 
     
      
    112 In Regina v Corbett (1991) 52 A Crim R 112 at 117, the Court (Gleeson CJ, Priestley JA and Mathews J) stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… once it has been decided to inflict a significant gaol term, it is not likely to be useful, in fixing its precise length, to increase it by refusing to give due weight to factors such as a plea of guilty, previous good record, previous positive contribution to the community, real prospects of rehabilitation; the impact upon a prisoner’s family and the heavy weight of punishment inevitably involved in the loss of professional possession and livelihood. These matters should be given real weight, and it is only in the sense that the need for general deterrence will not normally allow them to reduce the sentence below a significant period of incarceration that it is right to speak of giving ‘the greatest weight to the element of general deterrence.’” 
        
       
      
    113 As was observed by this Court in Boskovitz (supra) at [146], Corbett (supra) highlights the need for balance when dealing with general deterrence and that other matters favourable to an offender should not be ignored (at [146]). 
     
      
    114 In determining the appropriate length of the custodial term in this case, the applicant was entitled to a discount for his early plea of guilty. Additionally, the relevant subjective circumstances include:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The applicant’s recorded statement of intention that he did not intend to return to the financial industry. 
       
       
      (2) Character references in his favour from people in business who had known and who spoke well of him. 
       
       
      (3) The finding made that there was some  
      “considerable reason to suppose that he will not involve himself in this type of conduct in the future” 
      . 
       
       
      (4) His full co-operation with ASIC investigators. 
       
       
      (5) The fact that he has no previous convictions and is otherwise a person of good character. 
       
      
    115 The error in sentencing referred to above means that it is open to this Court to intervene and impose lesser sentences if considered that such lesser sentences are warranted: Criminal Appeal Act 1912, s.6(3).  
     
      
    116 In the event of re-sentencing, the applicant read his affidavit of 2 November 2008. The applicant suffers from a skin condition, psoriasis. 
     
      
    117 The applicant has had medical treatment, but arrangements have not to date been put in place for him to receive required treatment, being UV light treatment for the relief of pain under the supervision of the dermatologist. The condition from which he suffers, on the evidence, is an extreme skin problem and I accept that the deterioration during his period of custody has reached the point where medical treatment, which has not been available to him, will be required. Accordingly, his medical condition, in this respect, constitutes a post-sentence circumstance which this Court is entitled to have regard to on re-sentencing.  
     
      
    118 I consider that the effective non-parole period referred to by the sentencing judge consisting of a term of two years and five months is, in all the circumstances, manifestly excessive. However, by reason of the error in sentencing in failing to apply the Pearce principles, it is unnecessary to express any concluded view as to whether the total effective sentence imposed could also be said to be manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    119 Accordingly, on re-sentencing, I consider that, balancing the objective and subjective factors to which I have earlier referred, that a lesser sentence is warranted than that imposed by the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    120 In re-sentencing the applicant, for reasons stated below, I am of the opinion that, allowing for concurrency, cumulation and totality, that the total effective sentence be a period of two years and six months to commence two months after the operation of the sentences for the State offences. The total effective minimum period of imprisonment, accordingly, is a period of one year and eight months in respect of the Corporations Act offences, cumulative to the State offences. 
     
      
    121 In respect of the two offences under s.300(1) of the Crimes Act, I accept the submission made on behalf of the applicant that there was no evidence that the two persons concerned each lost $100,000. The total amount invested by them was $91,103.34. I propose to take that matter into account in re-sentencing in respect of those two State offences. 
     
      
    122 Accordingly, the orders I propose are:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      (2) The appeal be upheld. 
       
       
      (3) That the orders of the District Court made on 25 July 2008 be set aside. 
       
       
      (4) That in lieu the following sentences in respect of the State offences and the  
      Corporations Act offences  
      be imposed:- 
       
       
        
        (a) In respect of the offence contrary to s. 300(1) of the  
        Crimes Act

        (b) In respect of the offence contrary to s.300(1) of the

    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hall J. 
     
      
    2 HALL J: The Director of Public Prosecutions for the State of New South Wales appeals pursuant to s.5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, in respect of sentences imposed in the Sydney District Court (Flannery DCJ) on 11 April 2008. 
     
      
    3 The respondent was found guilty in respect of five counts following a trial conducted between 13 June 2007 and 20 June 2007. 
     
      
       
      Offences charged 
       
      
    4 The five counts pleaded in the indictment were as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: 
         That between 1 November 1999 and 31 December 2000 at Orange, the respondent had sexual intercourse with H, a person aged above 10 years and under 16 years, namely, 11 or 12 years. 
        
       
      
    5 The offence in respect of Count 1 was contrary to s.66C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and attracted, on conviction, a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term of eight years. 
     
      
       
        
        Count 2: 
         That between 1 November 1999 and 31 December 2000 at Orange, the respondent indecently assaulted H in circumstances of aggravation, namely, that at the time, H was under the age of 16 years, namely 11 or 12 years. 
        
       
      
    6 The offence in respect of Count 2 was contrary to s.61M(1) of the Crimes Act and attracted, on conviction, a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term of seven years. 
     
      
       
        
        Count 3: 
         That between 1 November 1999 and 31 December 2000 at Orange, the respondent had sexual intercourse with H, a person aged above 10 years and under 16 years, namely 11 or 12 years. 
        
       
      
    7 The offence in respect of Count 3 was contrary to s.66C(1) of the Crimes Act and attracted, on conviction, a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term of eight years. 
     
      
       
        
        Count 4: 
         That between 1 November 1999 and 31 December 2000 at Orange, the respondent had sexual intercourse with H, a person aged above 10 years and under 16 years, namely 11 or 12 years. 
        
       
      
    8 The offence in respect of Count 4 was contrary to s.66C(1) of the Crimes Act and, as stated above, attracted, on conviction, a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term of eight years. 
     
      
       
        
        Count 5:  
         That between 1 November 1999 and 31 December 2000 at Orange, the respondent incited H, who was then a person under the age of 16 years, namely 11 or 12 years, to an act of indecency with or towards the respondent. 
        
       
      
    9 The offence in respect of Count 5 was contrary to s.61N(1) of the Crimes Act and attracted, on conviction, a maximum penalty of imprisonment for a term of two years. 
     
      
    10 At the time of being sentenced by Flannery DCJ, the offender was serving sentences in respect of earlier convictions, inter alia, for manslaughter. The period of each sentence imposed by Flannery DCJ for the five counts in question is set out below.  
     
      
       
      Sentences imposed 
       
      
    11 The sentencing judge, on 11 April 2000, imposed the following sentences in respect of the five counts:- 
     
      
       
      (1)  
      Count 1: 
       a fixed term of two years to commence on 16 July 2030 and to expire on 15 July 2032. 
       
       
      (2)  
      Count 2: 
       a fixed term of 12 months to commence on 16 July 2030 and to expire on 15 July 2031. 
       
       
      (3)  
      Count 3:  
      a fixed term of two years to commence on 16 July 2030 and to expire on 15 July 2032. 
       
       
      (4)  
      Count 4: 
       a fixed term of 18 months to commence on 16 July 2030 and to expire on 15 January 2032. 
       
       
      (5)  
      Count 5:  
      a fixed term of three months to commence on 16 July 2030 and to expire on 15 October 2030. 
       
      
    12 Accordingly, the aggregate sentence imposed in relation to the five offences was a fixed term of two years to commence on 16 July 2030 and to expire on 15 July 2032. 
     
      
    13 By reason of these and the pre-existing sentences, the earliest date upon which the respondent will be eligible for release will be 15 July 2032. 
     
      
    14 In the written submissions on behalf of the respondent, it is acknowledged that, whilst the sentences in question in this Crown appeal may be considered lenient, they are to be considered in the context of the length of the existing sentences that had been imposed upon the respondent, the details of which are set out below. 
     
      
       
      Existing sentences 
       
      
    15 The total effective sentence and non-parole period imposed upon the respondent prior to the imposition of the sentences by the District Court was a total effective period of imprisonment of 37 years and 29 days commencing on 18 September 2003 and expiring on 16 October 2040 and a total effective non-parole period of 27 years, nine months and 29 days commencing on 18 September 2003 and expiring on 16 July 2031. 
     
      
       
      Ground of appeal 
       
      
    16 The single ground relied upon by the Crown in its appeal is that the sentences are said to be manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    17 Ms H Cox of counsel, who appeared on behalf of the respondent, in her written submissions dated 27 October 2008 (paragraph [8]) acknowledged that the Crown’s written submissions accurately set out the facts of the offences and the respondent’s subjective case. Accordingly, I reproduce below the facts as recorded in the Crown’s written submissions at paragraphs [7] to [11]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Facts 
        
       
       
        
        Count 1 and count 2 (ROS 1.5 – 1.7). 
        
       
       
        
        7. At the relevant time in 1999/2000 the Respondent lived and worked at the family property of the Complainant who was then aged 11 years. 
        
       
       
        
        8. On the subject occasion, the Complainant was walking home from her grandmother’s home which was located elsewhere on the family property when the Respondent stopped the Complainant and asked her to accompany him to a shed. The Complainant complied. 
        
       
       
        
        9. While in the shed, the Respondent told the Complainant to remove her clothing and lay on a mattress that was there. The Complainant further complied. Then, after smearing Vaseline over his penis and over the vagina of the Complainant, the Respondent engaged in penile-vaginal intercourse with the Complainant (count 1) and, after withdrawing his penis, the Respondent rubbed the Complainant upon the vagina with his hand (count 2). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3 and count 4 (ROS 1.8 – 1.9). 
        
       
       
        
        10. Some few days after the events in the first two counts, and again at the direction of the Respondent, the Complainant went to the shed, removed her clothing and lay upon a bed. The Respondent removed his own clothing and licked the vagina of the Complainant (count 3) and then engaged in penile-vaginal intercourse with the Complainant (count 4). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 5 (ROS 2.1). 
        
       
       
        
        11. Some days later again, the Complainant was at her own home when she observed the Respondent walk into the lounge room carrying a number of videotapes and then play one of the tapes in a VCR. The videotape portrayed two woman and a man engaged in sexual activity. When the Complainant went to leave, the Respondent grabbed hold of her and said ‘Stay!’. Thereafter, the Respondent sat next to the Complainant as the tape was played and asked her whether she felt ‘any different’ (count 5).” 
        
       
       
      Three groups of sentences 
       
      
    18 The Crown, in its written submissions, summarised what it termed the three groups of sentences, including the sentences the subject of the present appeal, as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The first group of offences were imposed in the District Court on 21 October 2004 by his Honour Judge Norrish QC in relation to convictions after trial for seven counts of sexual intercourse with a person under 10 years of age and one count of aggravated indecent assault upon a person under 10 years of age. 
       
       
        
        The sentences imposed in respect of those offences consisted of an aggregate term of 16 years and two months commencing on 18 September 2003 and expiring on 17 November 1919 and an aggregate non-parole period of 12 years and one month commencing on 18 September 2003 and expiring on 17 October 2015. 
        
       
       
      (2) The second group of offences initially imposed on 11 August 2006 in relation to convictions after trial for one count of manslaughter (returned by the jury on a murder count) and one count of sexual intercourse with a person under 10 years of age. The victim of both offences was a three year old boy. 
       
       
        
        The sentences initially imposed consisted of an aggregate term of 25 years commencing on 17 October 2015 and expiring on 16 October 2040 and an aggregate non-parole period of 18 years and nine months commencing on 17 October 2015 and expiring on 16 July 2034. 
        
       
       
        
        On appeal, this Court quashed the non-parole period of the manslaughter sentence and re-sentenced the respondent to an aggregate term of 25 years commencing on 17 October 2015 and expiring on 16 October 2040 and an aggregate non-parole period of 15 years and nine months commencing on 17 October 2015 and expiring on 16 July 2031. 
        
       
       
      (3) The third group of offences are the offences presently under appeal, the particulars of which are set out above. 
       
      
    19 In the Crown submissions, it is noted that the net effect of the sentences the subject of this appeal was the addition of one year to the total effective non-parole period.  
     
      
    20 In the respondent’s submissions, Ms Cox set out in convenient chart form the history of the sentences currently being served and I re-produce her summary as follows:-

      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    21 In its written submissions, the Crown observed that the learned sentencing judge in the remarks on sentence:- 
     
      
       
        
        “a. noted correctly the nature of the counts upon the indictment and the respective maximum penalties (ROS 1.3 – 1.5); 
        
       
       
        
        b. made brief findings of fact in relation to each of the five count (ROS 1.6 – 2.2); 
        
       
       
        
        c. found correctly that two (count 1 and count 4) of the three offences of sexual intercourse involved penile-vaginal intercourse (ROS 2.2); 
        
       
       
        
        d. found that there had been no force or coercion beyond that necessary to commit the offence (ROS 2.3) and that no threats or pressure had been made by the Respondent when he gave the Complainant directions that she not tell anyone about the offences (ROS 2.4); 
        
       
       
        
        e. found that while the aggravated indecent assault (count 2) was a serious example of an offence of its type, the incitement to an act of indecency offence (count 5) was not a particularly serious example of its type (ROS 2.5); 
        
       
       
        
        f. found that the Respondent had a significant prior history of sexual offences, particularly involving children (ORS 2.6 – 3.1); 
        
       
       
        
        g. ruled correctly that the criminal history of the Respondent was an aggravating factor in relation to the present offences as it demonstrated the Respondent had a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law (ROS 3.2 – 3.7); 
        
       
       
        
        h. ruled correctly that the sentences to be imposed ought to be incremented ‘… up in the range of appropriate sentences …’ because of the aggravating effect of the criminal history of the Respondent to ‘… reflect the greater need for retribution, deterrence and protection of society …’ (ROS 3.8); 
        
       
       
        
        i. found that none of the other aggravating factors by section 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) were present (ROS 3.9); 
        
       
       
        
        j. summarised the relevant subjective circumstances including that the Respondent: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          i. was born on 27 October 1972 (ROS 4.1); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ii. had been professional assessed as having a low average to borderline level of cognitive ability – 4th percentile (ROS 4.2); and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          iii. had reported to Dr Westmore that he considered himself to be a paedophile (ROS 4.5 – 4.6); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        k. referred to the sentences for manslaughter and sexual assault presently being served by the Respondent consequent upon the Orders of this Court (ROS 4.5 – 4.6); 
        
       
       
        
        l. correctly noted that pursuant to those Orders the Respondent would first have become eligible for release on parole on 15 July 2031 and that the term of the aggregate sentence was not due to expire until 16 October 2040 (ROS 4.7); 
        
       
       
        
        m. correctly observed that the principle of totality applied to the assessment of both any accumulation as between the individual sentences presently under appeal as well as any accumulation of those sentences upon the pre-existing sentences (ROS 4.8 – 4.9); 
        
       
       
        
        n. acknowledged that regard had been given to:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          i. the statutory framework and Common Law principles of sentencing; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ii. section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 199 (NSW); and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          iii. the need for general deterrence in cases such as the present (ROS 5.1 – 5.2); 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        o. referred to the ranges of sentence that were disclosed in the statistics that had been tendered (ROS 5.3 – 5.6); 
        
       
       
        
        p. indicated that some partial accumulation would have been ordered between the sentences here under appeal had it been that the Respondent was to be sentenced on those offences alone (ROS 5.7); 
        
       
       
        
        q. indicated that having regard to the length of the pre-existing sentences and the totality of the criminality disclosed in both those and the present offences, the sentences here under appeal would extend the aggregate non-parole period to be served by the Respondent by a further twelve (12) months (ROS 5.8 – 6.1); 
        
       
       
        
        r. acknowledged that one of the effects of such a disposition was to provide for an aggregate non-parole period that is in excess of three quarters of the aggregate term (ROS 6.2); 
        
       
       
        
        s. declined to impose a non-parole period for any of the present sentences since such non-parole periods ‘… would be subsumed by the sentences that the offender is presently serving …’ (ROS 6.3); 
        
       
       
        
        t. imposed the sentences presently under appeal (ROS 6.4 – 6.9).” 
        
       
      
    22 Ms Cox, in her written submissions (paragraph [11]), observed that the Crown had not submitted that the sentencing judge had failed to consider any relevant considerations in the sentencing exercise and, in fact, the Crown had conceded that her Honour had considered all relevant matters. 
     
      
       
      The Crown’s submissions 
       
      
    23 The Crown observed that the offences in question were quite discrete from those referred to in the first two groups of sentences set out above. The offences the subject of consideration in this appeal occurred between November 1999 and December 2000, whereas the offences in the other two groups occurred in September 2003. 
     
      
    24 It was also observed that the offences in question involved a young girl on a family farm, whereas the other groups of offences had involved two victims, being brother and sister, whom the respondent had been looking after in suburban Sydney. 
     
      
    25 The Crown submitted that the circumstances warranted consideration of partial accumulation between the sentences presently under appeal and the pre-existing sentences. 
     
      
    26 It further submitted that, in relation to the sentences presently under appeal, not only was it necessary that there be imposed appropriate individual sentences and an appropriate aggregate sentence as between those sentences, but it was also necessary that an appropriate total effective sentence be imposed having regard to the totality of the criminality for which the respondent was to be punished. In that respect, the Crown cited Regina v Holder [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 260 per Street CJ; Regina v MMK [2006] NSWCCA 272; (2006) 164 A Crim R 481 at [11] to [14] (Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ); Cahyadi v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 1; (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 at [27] to [29] per Howie J (with whom Adams and Price JJ agreed). 
     
      
    27 The Crown formulated three contentions in support of the appeal as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1)  
      Contention 1:  
      The learned sentencing Judge erred by imposing … sentences on Count 1, Count 2, Count 3, Count 4 and Count 5 that are individually manifestly inadequate 
       
      
    28 The Crown, in respect of this contention, relied upon the High Court’s judgment in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 at 623 to 624 per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ. 
     
      
    29 In this respect, the following considerations were identified as relevant to the assessment of the appropriate sentence in each count:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The respective maximum penalty. 
       
       
      (2) The objective seriousness of each offence. 
       
       
      (3) The substantial record of prior convictions that the respondent has for offences involving sexual violation of young children. 
       
       
      (4) The complete absence of any remorse or contrition demonstrated by the respondent defending the count at trial. 
       
       
      (5) The other subjective circumstances of the respondent. 
       
      
    30 The Crown contended that these matters and the relevant sentencing statistics tendered on sentence are sufficient to demonstrate that the sentences imposed on Count 1 and Count 4 were manifestly inadequate. In particular, the Crown contended that the sentences imposed could not appropriately reflect the circumstances of those offences, including that the respondent had engaged in penile-vaginal intercourse with an 11 year old child on her own family property. 
     
      
    31 It was submitted that the similarity of the circumstances of the two offences meant that the sentence imposed on Count 1 itself served to underscore that the sentence imposed on Count 4 was manifestly inadequate. The Crown contended that a term of imprisonment of not less than five years was required on each count. 
     
      
    32 In reliance on the same matters as identified above in relation to Counts 1 and 4, the Crown contended that a sentence of a term of not less than four years was required for Count 3. 
     
      
    33 Again, in reliance on the same factors, it was submitted that a sentence of a term of imprisonment of not less than three years was required for Count 2. 
     
      
    34 In respect of Count 5, it was contended that a sentence of not less than 12 months was required. 
     
      
       
      (2)  
      Contention 2:  
      The learned sentencing judge erred in the application of the principle of totality by imposing an aggregate sentence as between the five counts presently under appeal that is manifestly inadequate 
       
      
    35 In this respect, the Crown noted that the sentences under appeal related to five offences occurring on three discrete occasions. 
     
      
    36 The sentencing judge, the Crown observed, acknowledged that some degree of partial accumulation would otherwise have been appropriate as between the five individual sentences, but that such partial accumulation was itself subject to the operation of an aspect of the principle of totality concerning the accumulation of sentences upon any pre-existing sentences. 
     
      
    37 The Crown drew attention to the fact that the sentencing judge did not provide for any accumulation as between the five offences the subject of the present appeal and imposed an aggregate sentence of a fixed term of two years. 
     
      
    38 It was contended that her Honour was required to impose an aggregate sentence in relation to the present sentences that appropriately reflected the totality of the criminality disclosed in those offences: Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 63 per Wilson, Deane, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ; Pearce (supra) at 623 to 624 per McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ. 
     
      
    39 The Crown further submitted that, having regard to the totality of the criminality disclosed in relation to Counts 1 to 5, an aggregate sentence of not less than 10 years and an aggregate non-parole period of not less than seven and a half years was required. 
     
      
    40 It, accordingly, submitted that the sentences should be quashed and the respondent should be re-sentenced, making appropriate orders for accumulation as between the new sentences to be imposed on Counts 1 to 5. 
     
      
       
      (3)  
      Contention 3:  
      The learned sentencing judge erred in the application of the principle of totality by imposing upon the applicant sentences that have resulted in a total effective sentence that is manifestly inadequate. 
       
      
    41 As observed above, the Crown noted that the net effect of the sentences presently under appeal was the addition of one year to the total effective non-parole period. 
     
      
    42 The Crown contended that, subject to the application of the principle of totality, and having regard to s.44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, the circumstances warranted consideration of partial accumulation between the sentences presently under appeal and the pre-existing sentences. 
     
      
    43 The Crown finally contended that the relevant considerations demonstrated that consequent upon the imposition of the sentences presently under appeal, the non-parole period of the total effective term was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    44 Accordingly, the submission was that the sentences should be quashed in respect of Counts 1 to 5 and the respondent re-sentenced, making appropriate orders for the accumulation of the new sentences upon the pre-existing sentences. 
     
      
       
      The respondent’s submissions 
       
      
    45 Ms Cox contended that what the Crown described as an appropriate aggregate sentence of not less than 10 years and an aggregate non-parole period of seven and a half years, would be a sentence of such magnitude that it would have to be, at least, partially accumulated on the pre-existing sentence. 
     
      
    46 Accordingly, it was submitted, that the effect of such a sentence would have been to partially extend the non-parole period but at the expense of the parole period, “a matter which weighed heavily upon her Honour” (Respondent’s written submissions, at [22]). 
     
      
    47 Ms Cox contended that, given what she termed were “the highly unusual features of the extreme length of the sentences already imposed upon the respondent …”, the issues of totality and the overall need to avoid imposing a “crushing sentence” upon the respondent, the sentences imposed were not manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    48 In that respect, Ms Cox contended the following matters were appropriately taken into account by the sentencing judge:- 
     
      
       
      • That the sentence (and the sentences already imposed) were to be served by the respondent in conditions of hardship on protection. 
       
       
      • The respondent’s subjective circumstances. 
       
       
      • The available maximum penalty. 
       
       
      • The objective criminality of the offences as found by the sentencing judge. 
       
      
    49 It was consequently contended on behalf of the respondent that, given what was termed the unusual and complex features of the sentencing exercise, the sentences imposed were within the reasonable range of the sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    50 It was contended that the sentencing judge appropriately considered and applied the principle of totality as it affected the sentencing exercise. In that respect, reference was made to the observations of McHugh J in Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 308 as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… a sentencing judge must consider the total criminality involved, not only in the offences for which the offender is being sentenced, but also in any offences for which the offender is currently serving a sentence.” 
        
       
      
    51 Ms Cox contended that the sentencing judge was alive to the importance of this principle when sentencing the respondent, referring to the following observations by the sentencing judge (remarks on sentence, p.4.9):- 
     
      
       
        
        “In those circumstances, the principle of totality looms large. I must have regard to the criminality involved not only in the matters before me but also in the matters that the offender is currently serving sentences in relation to and having done so determined what, if any, downward adjustment is necessary in the aggravated sentences  
        [sic]  
        in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences.” 
        
       
       
      Consideration  
       
      
    52 The present appeal raises the issue of the need to maintain an appropriate relationship between the totality of the criminality involved in a case involving a series of offences and the total of the sentences to be imposed for those offences: Regina v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; (2006) 167 A Crim R 159 at [15]. 
     
      
    53 As the Crown observed, the sentences the subject of this appeal were imposed in relation to five counts that disclosed offending which had occurred on three discrete occasions. 
     
      
    54 Additionally, Counts 1 and 4 involved a high level of criminality involving offences of sexual intercourse with a child of a young age.  
     
      
    55 Those matters must be considered in light of the fact that, at the time of sentencing in respect of the five counts in question, the respondent was serving an existing sentence for a number of very serious offences occurring later in time than the five counts to which I have referred, with a total effective term of 37 years and 29 days commencing on 18 September 2003 and expiring on 16 October 2040 and a total effective non-parole period of 27 years, nine months and 29 days commencing on 18 September 2003 and expiring on 16 July 2031. 
     
      
    56 In Postiglione (supra) at 307 to 308, McHugh J observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The totality principle of sentencing requires a judge who is sentencing an offender for a number of offences to ensure that the aggregation of the sentences appropriate for each offence is a just and appropriate measure of the total criminality involved …” 
        
       
      
    57 McHugh J cited remarks of King CJ in Regina v Rossi (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal of SA; 20 April 1988) as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “There is a principle of sentencing known as the principle of totality, which enables a court to mitigate what strict justice would otherwise indicate, where the total effect of the sentences merited by the individual crimes becomes so crushing as to call for the merciful intervention of the court by way of reducing the total effect.” 
        
       
      
    58 McHugh J went on to observe in Postiglione (supra) at 308:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The application of the totality principle therefore requires an evaluation of the overall criminality involved in all the offences with which the prisoner is charged … Where necessary, the Court must adjust the prima facie length of the sentences downward in order to achieve an appropriate relativity between the totality of the criminality and the totality of the sentences …” 
        
       
      
    59 In MAK (supra), this Court (Spigelman CJ, Whealy and Howie JJ) at [16] observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The severity of a sentence is not simply the product of a linear relationship. That is to say severity may increase at a greater rate than an increase in the length of a sentence. As Malcolm CJ said in  
        Regina v Clinch 
          
        (1994) 72 A Crim R 301 at 306:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘… the severity of a sentence increases at a greater rate than any increase in the length of sentence. Thus, a sentence of five years is more than five times as severe as a sentence of one year. Similarly, while a sentence of seven years may be appropriate for one set of offences and a sentence of eight years may be appropriate for another set of offences, each looked at in isolation, where both sets were committed by the one offender a sentence of 15 years may be out of proportion to the degree of criminality involved because of the compounding effect on the severity of the total sentence of simply aggregating the two sets of sentences.’” 
          
         
        
       
      
    60 Ms Cox submitted that, in the event the respondent’s primary submission was rejected, the Court should nonetheless abstain from exercising its discretion in Crown appeals for a number of specific identified reasons including:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That the aggregate head sentence to which the respondent is currently subjected extends until 16 October 2040, at which time he will be 68 years old. 
       
       
      (2) That the date of the respondent’s first consideration for release to parole is 15 July 2032, when he will be 60 years old. 
       
      
    61 The sentencing judge was required to consider whether a sentence imposed in respect of the five counts in question, having regard to the extremely long effective total sentence and non-parole period being served by the respondent as at the date of sentencing, would result in a sentence which would be “crushing” upon him in the sense referred to by this Court in MAK (supra), namely, that it would induce a feeling of hopelessness and destroy any expectation of a useful life after release. As the Court there observed (at [17]):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… This effect both increases the severity of the sentence to be served and also destroys such prospects as there may be of rehabilitation and reform. Of course, in many cases of multiple offending, the offender may not be entitled to the element of mercy entailed in adopting such a constraint.”  
        
       
      
    62 It is, of course, necessary in a case such as the present for a sentencing court to exercise care when applying the totality principle for as this Court observed in MAK (supra) at [18], public confidence in the administration of justice requires the Court to avoid any suggestion that what is in effect being offered is some kind of a discount for multiple offending. As stated in MAK (supra) “… for similar reasons in a case such as the present where an offender who is already serving other sentences comes to be sentenced for additional offences, the impression must not be given that no, or little, penalty is imposed for the additional offences” (at [18]). 
     
      
    63 I am of the opinion that the sentencing judge correctly applied the principle of totality to the circumstances of the present case in determining the sentence imposed. In other words, I am of the opinion that her Honour was correct in identifying that some amelioration of the punishment otherwise warranted was necessary and that the exercise of her judgment in that respect was an appropriate one. That conclusion is stated, mindful of the fact that, whilst the sentences imposed were lenient, they were not such as to require this Court to intervene in the interest of the general community. In reaching that conclusion, I have borne in mind the relevant principles that apply to Crown appeal: Regina v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42. A proper recognition and application of the limits applying to Crown appeals, accordingly, results in the conclusion, in my opinion, that the appeal should fail. 
     
      
    64 Accordingly, the order I propose is that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    65 HARRISON J: I agree with Hall J.

    JUDGMENT1 This application to admit evidence by the Crown has been the subject of a voir dire hearing which has just been completed. I admitted as exhibit VDA a statement of Meegan Romeo, dated 21 April 2008.2 The issue arises in this way. Mr Adup, the accused, is charged by the Crown with two offences, the second being an alternative to the first. The first offence is breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing non-consensual sexual intercourse with an occupant, who is the complainant in these proceedings. The second charge, which is as I say in the alternative, is non-consensual sexual intercourse with the same complainant.3 The primary issue in the case, it seems to me, is whether or not the complainant consented to the sexual intercourse which I understand admittedly occurred between her and the accused.4 I understand from Mr Taylor, who appears for the accused, that part of his case will be that there was an arrangement entered into earlier, some hours before the sexual intercourse occurred. The arrangement was entered into at a hotel where both the complainant and the accused were drinking. The sexual intercourse occurred at the complainant’s house some hours later. Briefly, the arrangement was, according to the accused, that he and the complainant would meet up at her house later on.TAYLOR: I’m reluctant to interrupt your Honour, but I understand the evidence will be that the arrangement was made at Mr Adup’s house, not the licensed premises.HIS HONOUR: Thank you. I am corrected. The arrangement was made not at the hotel, but earlier at the accused’s premises. The arrangement included an understanding that consensual sexual intercourse would occur. 5 In the context of the charges and the anticipated evidence of the arrangement, the Crown Prosecutor tenders VDA and proposes to call Meegan Romeo. She will give evidence that she had been drinking at the same hotel as the complainant and the accused some hours before the sexual intercourse occurred. She left the hotel and was chatting to a man she described as an “African guy” in front. At some stage the African guy gave her his phone number and she rang it. The accused is from Sudan and is appropriately described as an African guy.6 Part of the evidence will be that he was part of a group of men from the Sudan who lived in a street nearby the complainant. A number of those men were at the hotel that night.7 Ms Romeo walked away from the hotel and her phone rang. It was what she described as “the African guy”. A male voice said to her “What are you doing tonight?” and she said “I am going home”. The male voice responded “Can I come and pick you up and give you a lift?” And she said “No, I am going home”. He said “Are you sure?” She said “Yes I am sure”. Her statement goes on to say that she said a number of times she did not need a lift, but he continued asking if he could come and pick her up. She ended up by hanging up on him. The phone rang a number of times more and the same phone number came up on the screen.8 It will be part of the Crown case that the telephone from which the call was made to Ms Romeo was owned by the accused. 9 Mr Pincott, the Crown Prosecutor who is briefed in this trial, says that the evidence is relevant for three reasons. The first reason is that it is relevant to the issue of whether there was a break and enter in accordance with the first count. He says the evidence is inconsistent with what he anticipates the accused’s case will be that the entry by him later on that evening into the complainant’s house where the sexual intercourse occurred was by a prior arrangement and therefore by consent.10 The second point of relevance Mr Pincott argues is that it is relevant to the prior arrangement that the later encounter should include sexual intercourse.11 The third point of relevance he says is to the credibility of the accused. It is inconsistent he says with his anticipated assertion that there was an arrangement between him and the complainant and therefore affects his credibility.12 Mr Taylor argues that the evidence is not relevant in that it does not meet the test of relevance set out in s 55 of the Evidence Act 1995. He argues that it is not evidence that if it were accepted “could rationally affect (directly or indirectly) the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue in the proceedings.” He argues that there is clearly the possibility that the telephone call may have been made by one of the other African men rather than the accused. (I should have added earlier that the statement of Ms Romeo does not identify specifically the accused as the particular African man whom she was engaged in conversation with.) In addition, Mr Taylor argues that it is not relevant because his client may have changed his mind about the arrangement.13 In my opinion the evidence is clearly relevant. It is, in my opinion, relevant to at least two of the issues put forward by Mr Pincott, namely the fact of consent and the entry into the premises. The evidence is capable of reducing the likelihood that there was an arrangement between the accused and the complainant because it suggests that he was acting in a way that is inconsistent with an arrangement with somebody else.14 Mr Taylor further objects to the evidence on the basis of s 137 of the Evidence Act. He argues that I must refuse to admit the evidence because its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to his client.15 The unfair prejudice must be just that. Prejudice in the sense that it might tend to point to his client’s guilt is not sufficient. It must be capable of some way being misused by the jury. But the test is mandatory once I have performed the balancing exercise. If I am convinced that the probative value is outweighed then I must exclude it.16 Mr Taylor argues that the probative value of the evidence is slight. Once again he points to the fact that there is no evidence that it was his client who made the particular phone calls. All it demonstrates, he said, is that it was his phone that was being used. There is clearly the reasonable possibility that the phone may have been shared amongst his companions. He supports that by exhibit VD1, which is a custody management record demonstrating that his client was arrested at about a quarter past 6 on 27 January 2008, which is the date of the alleged offence. When he compares VD1 with VDB, which are records of the telephone usage of the accused’s phone, it is clear and I accept, that the accused’s telephone was still in active use after his arrest. This, he says, is consistent with the phone being, if not common property, clearly used amongst his client’s friends.17 His second argument on probative value is that it is slight because at the most it may indicate that his client may have changed his mind about the arrangement which he made. As Mr Taylor said, he may have decided to hedge his bets. 18 On the other hand Mr Taylor argues that the evidence contains the danger of unfair prejudice to his client. He says it sails close to tendency evidence. He says the tendency would be to “pick up” a woman for casual sex. He says it comes close also to character evidence and that is in the sense that his client was, once again, a person likely to pick up another person for a casual sexual encounter after a session of drinking.19 I think there is real force in Mr Taylor’s submission. To my mind, when I perform the balancing exercise required of me by s 37, the probative value of the evidence is, in my opinion, reduced in the ways which Mr Taylor submits. There is clearly a reasonable possibility that the phone may have been shared around, that possibility being advanced by exhibit VD1. In addition, the probative value of the evidence is reduced by the possibility that the accused may have simply changed his mind about a prior arrangement. On the other hand, the evidence is capable of being used by the jury as possibly demonstrating a predatory component in the accused’s behaviour, that is, that he was indiscriminately seeking someone to have sex with that evening. That, in my opinion, could distract the jury from what, in both counts, is a very significant issue of whether or not a sexual encounter was by consent, which in turn involves the question whether the jury accepts beyond reasonable doubt the complainant’s assertion that there was no consensual arrangement between her and the accused.20 In my opinion, the probative value of the evidence tendered by the prosecution is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused and I refuse to admit it.

   JUDGMENTApplication for Severance of charge from indictment 1. The Crown has charged the accused, Craig Thomas Haines with three counts relating to unlawful sexual conduct. Each count in the indictment relates to a different complainant. The first charge alleges an indecent assault upon Lauralee M; the second alleges a breaking and entering into a bedroom within a dwelling house known as 38 Toomelah with the intent of indecently assaulting Karina M in circumstances of aggravation. The third charge alleges the accused broke and entered into a second bedroom at 38 Toomelah and indecently assaulted Kirsten M, in circumstances of aggravation. Kirsten M is a 16-year-old cousin of Karina M. In the second and third counts the circumstance of aggravation is that there was a third person present in the respective bedroom, and the accused knew that. All offences are said to have occurred within hours of midnight on 23 rd March 2007. The time span for the commission of these offences on the Crown case seems defined as between the early hours of the morning and 6:15am.  2. It would be open to a jury to come to a view the offence alleged to have occurred first in time was the offence of entering the bedroom where Karina was, with an intent of indecently assaulting her. That was followed by the offence alleged against Kristen. The last in sequence on the Crown case was the offending conduct alleged to have occurred against Lauralee.  3. The defence seeks a severance from the indictment of the charge alleging the accused offended against Lauralee. On the Crown case that offence occurs at premises known as 25 Toomelah, a house within 100yds of house 38 Toomelah.  The Crown Cases4. Karina M gives an account of being asleep in a bedroom with her then boyfriend Aaron Hinch. They were together in a single bed. The room in which they were sleeping had a door lock controlled from inside the bedroom. Karina M locked the door before going to sleep. She woke to feel someone touching her and grabbing her around the waist on her right side. She said, “Who’s that?” No one answered. She saw the accused jump up from the floor on her side of the bed and walk from the room. (Count 2)  5. Meanwhile in a second bedroom Kirsten M was asleep. She was in a single bed. In the same bedroom was Alinta M who was sleeping in another single bed. This room also had a lock on the door. Kirsten had locked the door before going to bed. Kirsten M woke as someone was coming toward her. He jumped on top of her and groped between her legs with his hand. She kicked him and he was pushed from the bed landing near some mirrors in the room. He crawled beside the bed laying there quietly for a couple of seconds. Then he pushed his hand up under a blanket on Kirsten M’s bed. She pushed his hand away. (Count 3)  6. At this point Karina M entered the room. Alinta M woke up and said to the intruder “Get out!” or words to that effect. The accused remained on the floor as though pretending to be asleep. Karina M called on Kirsten M to get up. She did so. Both cousins walked to the kitchen. Alinta M joined them. They had a three-way discussion. In the course of the discussion the accused was seen standing in the hallway watching both complainants. He shortly thereafter walked from the premises.  7. At about 6:15am. the accused was in the premises 25 Toomelah. Lauralee M was sleeping in her bedroom. Her daughter was also sleeping in the same room. Lauralee M woke to being touched on her clothing covering her backside. She felt a hand between the buttock cheeks in the region of her anus. (Count 1) By the time she woke the offender was standing near the bedroom door. Contrary to her practice the TV and lights were off. She had left the lights and TV on when she fell asleep. She said “Who’s that?”. The intruder replied, “It’s me Anthony.” Anthony Hinch was then a resident at 25 Toomelah. Lauralee M said “What are you doing in my room.” The person replied: “I’m looking for Renella”. Renella is the younger sister of Lauralee. At the time of this conversation on the Crown case both Anthony Hinch and Renella were asleep together in another bedroom. Anthony was Renella’s then boyfriend.  8. Lauralee M left her bed walked to another bedroom at the other end of the house. As she went she was turning on lights. She turned on the light in this bedroom. The accused was laying on a single bed in the room. She woke her sister Renella in the adjacent room by knocking on the bedroom door. As she was doing so she was telling the accused to get up. He responded, “Where am I. I’m home ain’t I?” He wouldn’t go for a while. When the accused got up he was saying he didn’t know who Lauralee was. She told him she was ringing the police. He denied having done anything wrong.  The Defence issues9. Initially Mr MacCallum, counsel for the accused sought to argue the charge alleging offending against Lauralee M could not properly be contained in an indictment containing charges relating to the other two complainants. The practice book used by most judges of this Court, Butterworth’s Criminal Practice and Procedure NSW, makes clear:  
     
      
      An indictment may contain more than one count, but each count must allege a separate and distinct offence and there must be a verdict on each:… Different offences may be contained in the one indictment if there is some connection between the crimes. This will be so if the evidence of one is admissible on the trial of the other. (authorities and some text omitted). (p.6323).  
     10. The impact of the last sentence of that citation needs to be explored more fully. In Kray [1970] 1 Q.B. 125 at 130-131; the principle was set out more fully in the English Court of Appeal, Criminal Division in a judgment of Widgery LJ:   
     
      
      “[O]ffences cannot be regarded as of a similar character for the purposes of joinder unless some sufficient nexus exists between them. Such nexus is certainly established if the offences are so connected that the evidence of one would be admissible on the trial of the other, but it is clear that the rule is not restricted to such circumstances.  
       
      
    11. In De Jesus 22 A Crim R. 375 at 381 Mason and Deane JJ stated the principle emerging from the High Court case, Sutton v The Queen (1984) 152 C.L.R. 528, thus: 
     
      
       
      …[W]here an accused is charged with a number of sexual offences with different females on different occasions, the charges should not be tried together if the evidence on one count is not admissible on another count: Brennan J [in  
      Sutton v The Queen 
      ] expressed the point in this way 
       
        
       
      “Where that evidence is not admissible towards proof of his guilt of the other offence, some step must be taken to protect the accused person against the risk of impermissible prejudice. Sometimes a direction to the jury is sufficient to guard against such a risk; sometimes it is not.”  
      
    Later his Honour said: 
     
      
        
       
      “Where the evidence admissible on one count is not admissible on another, and in consequence there is a real risk of impermissible prejudice to the accused, the sound exercise of the discretion generally (if not universally) requires a direction for separate trials.  
      
    12. In the circumstances of this case there are circumstances linking the offences. These offences on the Crown case all occurred within an area of housing on the Toomelah Aboriginal mission. The accused is Aboriginal. My understanding is he lives on the mission. Each of the complainants is Aboriginal. These offences all occurred within a short distance of each other, two in one house, and the third in a nearby residence. These offences all occurred within a short span of time of each other, described as from “early in the morning” to 6-15am. All complainants identified the accused as being an uninvited person within the dwelling house where he was seen. His presence in each house (notwithstanding his alleged remarks to Lauralee M) remains otherwise unexplained – although one has to be careful not to reverse the onus of proof, this still seems a valid link among the offences. 13. This evidence becomes circumstantial evidence in all cases of the presence of the accused in the relevant area, at a time proximate to the alleged offending. It also provides evidence supportive of the complainants in respect of each’s claim to have seen the accused in an area and at a time relatively close to when other complainants saw him. Finally, it increases in a very substantial way the value to the Crown of the accused’s behaviour when confronted by the relevant complainants in each location. 14. On reflection it does not appear to me the circumstances referred to in paragraph 12 qualify as coincidence evidence because those items of evidence do not meet the test of “related events”. Nor do they prove the improbability of the criminal events occurring co-incidentally. By this I mean the circumstances referred to do not qualify as “similar fact” or “modus operandi” of the precise criminal acts of indecent assault or intent to commit indecent assault that the Crown must prove in respect of each complainant. The circumstances referred to in that paragraph do not, standing by themselves, amount to criminal conduct. 15. Even so, it appears to me the evidence from Lauralee M that she saw the accused at 25 Toomelah about 6-15am. after he had left 38 Toomelah (on the Crown case) is admissible as evidence of circumstances supporting Karina M and Kirsten M that the accused was at 38 Toomelah, and had left that address for some reason at some earlier point in time that morning. Even if those facts are not disputed, the Crown is entitled to call the evidence – because it is relevant and relates to a fact in issue. It also offers, limited as it may be, some independent supportive evidence to the two complainants. I note the supportive evidence does not go to the elements of the offence – but it does go to circumstances in which, on the Crown case those elements were committed by the accused. 16. I have referred to evidence of the behaviour of the accused when confronted by complainants in their respective houses. This behaviour by the accused on the Crown case presents as distinctive. The behaviour bears closer scrutiny. 17. Kirsten M says the accused having been kicked from her bed landed near the mirrors. He then crawled beside her bed, and then pretended to be asleep for a short moment. The account continues that he made an attempt to touch her, but using her hand she pushed him away. Then he pretended to be asleep even though Alinta M had told him to “get out”. Karina M came into the room. She told Kirsten M to leave the room. The accused remained behind pretending to be asleep. While Kirsten M, Karina M and Alinta M were talking in the kitchen the accused, no longer pretending to be asleep, stood watching them. Shortly after, he left the premises. 18. Lauralee M had been indecently assaulted. She verbally confronted a male in her room. The male identified himself as Anthony. On the Crown case it was not Anthony Hinch. She identified the voice as the voice of her cousin, the accused. Lauralee M walked to another room at the other end of the house where she saw the accused laying on a single bed. She knocked on the door and told him to “Get out”. He said, “Where am I? I’m home aren’t I?” 19. On the Crown case in both instances the accused had used a ruse of being asleep in an attempt to deflect any suspicion from himself. On the Crown case in a very short period of time, significantly after 3 sexually oriented offences have occurred in two nearby premises, in an area primarily peopled by a small Aboriginal community, this same ruse of being asleep is used. In such a situation the conduct constitutes an admission by conduct of the only person who was, or could have been, at both sites. 20. The conduct is sufficiently distinctive in the circumstances of this case (proximity of time, very restricted geographic location, small distinctive community, intrusion in the bedrooms where each complainant was sleeping, the assault of a sexual nature and the complainants’ responses, unexplained presence of accused and no other viable suspect present at the houses) as to constitute a signature of uniqueness referable only to the accused. 21. My initial impression was this behaviour constituted tendency evidence; that is, evidence of conduct of the accused to act in a particular way when confronted by a female who chastised him for unlawful sexually related conduct. Mr McCallum submitted it was better described as coincidence evidence. If I understand his argument he accepts the behaviour qualifies as: “two or more substantially and relevantly similar events occurring in circumstances that were substantially similar” (See Evidence Act 1995 s.98 (2)).22. However it may be catalogued, the Crown is seeking to rely upon these responses as proving the same person was present in both dwelling houses, was being confronted by females wanting him to leave premises in circumstances where those females believed he had behaved inappropriately sexually toward them, and had made their position clear at the time he allegedly offended against each. The Crown seeks to rely upon the accused’s response of pretending to be asleep as an admission by conduct by him of being aware that he was being blamed for that offending conduct and seeking to avoid dealing with the complainants in those circumstances. While it cannot be put as high as the accused demonstrating a conscientiousness of guilt, on the Crown case it demonstrates a tendency to act in that distinctive way when so confronted. It also points to his responding in the way he did on each occasion as unlikely to be coincidental behaviour. The tendency to so act, and the unlikeliness of it being a coincidence are strong circumstances point towards guilt. 23. There is a difficulty many experience of distinguishing between tendency evidence and coincidence evidence. There are occasions when the same evidence may overlap as one or the other. However, it seems to me the safeguard provisions of s.97 (1)(b) and 98 (1)(b) and s.101 of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act) apply whether this evidence qualifies as tendency or coincidence evidence. 24. Thus, on the material before me, subject to being satisfied in respect of the safeguard matters I have referred to, I am inclined to regard the Crown as entitled to join all three counts in the same indictment, and to allow the Crown to proceed on all three charges in the same indictment before the same jury. 25. The Crown has given a Tendency and Coincidence Evidence Notice sufficient to satisfy the defence that it was on notice the Crown would be seeking to rely upon the behaviour of the accused after the alleged offence upon Kirsten M and the behaviour of the accused after the alleged offence upon Lauralee M as coincidence or tendency evidence. 26. Mr McCallum sought to identify reasons why evidence of the accused’s behaviour post those two alleged offences would not qualify as either tendency or coincidence. He sought to argue there was a real possibility of concoction. His initial argument sought to raise the potential for concoction of evidence coming from Karina M and Kirsten M. Factors contributing to the presence of a real possibility of concoction include an awareness that Lauralee M had made a complaint to police; the three complainants were all related and closely associated in the Toomelah community; and Karina M and Kirsten M must have been aware the accused was arrested on the evening of 23 rd March 2007 in relation to the complaint made by Lauralee M. Karina M and Kirsten M first reported their complaints to police on 30 th March 2007; that is seven days after Lauralee’s initial complaint. 27. On 30th March 2007 police had come to Toomelah, it would seem, to take statements from witnesses who could corroborate Lauralee M’s account against the accused. Among statements taken was a statement from Kirsten M, aged 16 years. Seven days earlier at the time of his arrest on the 23 rd March 2007 the accused complained to police that persons in the community were openly talking about his committing inappropriate sexual acts against a young person. However, the inappropriate sexual act nominated by the accused (“raped a little girl”) to police bears little comparison to the allegation Kirsten M is making against him. 28. A second voir dire hearing was held to take evidence on the issue of concoction. From the evidence on the voir dire I would be satisfied Lauralee M called police shortly after 6-15am. on 23 rd March 2007. She complained to them in terms contained in V.D. Exhibit 1. Her complaint was taken down in one Sgt Fraser’s notebook. While police were speaking to her, or at very least around that time, Anthony Hinch left 25 Toomelah to attend house 38 Toomelah. Anthony Hinch certainly knew the accused had been at 25 Toomelah at 6:15am. Hinch certainly knew he had been told to leave those premises. It is likely he knew Lauralee was upset at the accused. What is less clear is what, if anything he knew about general or specific allegations Larualee was about to make to the police when they arrived. 29. Within an hour or so of police leaving, Lauralee M had been told the accused had even earlier that morning been at the home of Ricky Paul Duncan (38 Toomelah). She had also been told that he was said to have done “the same thing” to other females at that house. It is likely she knew the identity of the females allegedly so assaulted. (I note if that is what Lauralee M heard, it is not precisely reflected in the charges before the Court). What flows from Lauralee hearing of the allegations coming from 38 Toomelah is that Karina M and Kirsten M were already making allegations against the accused within two hours of Lauralee M ringing police. The precise nature of what was told to Anthony Hinch – the likely source of the information from 38 Toomelah – and from whom he received such information is still unclear on the evidence. Nor is it clear what, if anything, Anthony Hinch told the residents at Rick Paul Duncan’s home in respect of what had happened in Lauralee’s bedroom at 6-15am. 30. It is fair to say that in the circumstances in which the account came from 38 Toomelah within such a short time of Lauralee complaining to Sgt Fraser, there is nothing suggesting concoction by either Karina M or Kirsten M. The terms of the Crown case are such that I would expect independent supporting evidence of he presence of the accused at both residences on the morning of 23 rd March 2007. Further, although given opportunity to cross-examine each complainant on the voir dire – only in the case of one, was the issue directly raised. On that occasion the proposition put by the defence was denied. No motive to concoct was advanced by either side. Nor was any clear instance or circumstance amounting to a real possibility of concoction discovered in the voir dire evidence. 31. The best that can be said of the evidence so far as the defence claim of concoction is concerned is that there were seven days between Lauralee M’s first statement to police and the statements made by other complainants that would have left open seven days to concoct evidence. Put another way there was enough time to concoct an account. But the weight to be given to the opportunity of concoction is diminished by allegations being made of sexually inappropriate behaviour within a couple of hours of Lauralee contacting police, and the independent evidence supporting the presence of the accused in each residence. 32. The speed with which news of the alleged offending conduct at 38 Toomelah first reached Lauralee M strongly points to spontaneity of reporting, rather than concocting. Nor is any motive suggested for concoction. While the defence case may challenge all evidence from Karina M and Kirsten M as concocted, of particular interest here is whether the accused’s alleged resort to the sleeping ruse when confronted by the complainants was concocted by Karina M and Kirsten M. There is no similarity of fact in respect of the alleged assaults or acts of indecency constituting the indecent assaults claimed by Karina M and Kirsten M. Nor, save for the sleeping ruse, does either of the encounters with the accused they allege present as hauntingly similar to the allegations made by Lauralee. Moreover, neither Karina M nor Kirsten M anticipated the police would be talking to her. Neither sought out the police. It would seem other members of the community, having heard of their complainants, pointed police in their direction. 33. In the absence of any apparent desire to contact police, what other motive could have inspired a concoction. It seems to me the defence is left in this position. Any concoction by them would have been based on some conspiracy to seek notoriety by both claiming falsely to have been sexually assaulted by the accused, or because of some general malice held towards the accused. Frankly, the first seems unreasonably offensive to them, and the second has not even been alleged in the cross-examination. There is no basis for finding any such malice. As is so frequently the experience of this Court, the likely explanation for their not seeking out the police is they were not intending to seek resolution of their situation in the courtroom. 34. I am satisfied during the seven-day period between 23rd March and 30th March 2007 there was discussion among members of the community in Toomelah in respect of the fact that allegations were being made about the accused by all complainants. The complainants’ positions seems to be they were not involved in general discussion. But at least two of the complainant’s gave an account to their respective mothers. At least one of the complainant’s gave an account to her cousin, another complainant. I cannot rule out persons who received complaints may well have been responsible for, or fuelled community discussion. How well informed the community discussion was is not of relevance. I have assumed that the accused’s remark to Sgt Fraser when arrested, assuming it accurately reflected what the accused had heard, arose from community discussion, and not from any recounting by the complainants of their allegations to the general community. 35. Even if I accept there was some level of community based discussion, that is not sufficient to establish a reasonably possibility of concoction by Kirsten M and Karina M of what they say occurred at 38 Toomelah. The scope of the enquiry to be undertaken by the judge, and the circumstances in which evidence of similarity of accounts is to be excluded are conveniently set out in the judgment of Mason CJ, Wilson and Gaudron JJ in Hock’s case. 
     
      
      Thus, in our view, the admissibility of similar fact evidence in cases such as the present depends on that evidence having the quality that it is not reasonably explicable on the basis of concoction. That is a matter to be determined, as in all cases of circumstantial evidence, in the light of common sense and experience. It is not a matter that necessarily involves an examination on a voir dire. If the dispositions of witnesses in committal proceedings or statements of witness indicate that the witnesses had no relationship with each other prior to the making of the various complaints, and that is unchallenged, then assuming the requisite degree of similarity, common sense and experience will indicate that the evidence bears that probative force which renders it admissible. On the other hand, if the depositions or the statements indicate that the complainants have a sufficient relationship to each other  
      and had opportunity and motive for concoction 
       then as a matter of common sense and experience, the evidence will lack the degree of probative value necessary to render it admissible. Of course there may be cases where an examination on the voir dire is necessary, but that will be for the purposes of ascertaining the facts relevant to the circumstances of the witnesses to permit an assessment of the probative value of the evidence by reference to the consideration whether, in the light of common sense and experience it is capable of  
      reasonable  
      explanation on the basis of concoction. It will not be for the purpose of the trial judge making a preliminary finding whether there was or was not concoction. (Underlining not in original text).  
      Hock v The Queen 
       (1988) 165 CLR 292 at 297. 
      
    36. On their rationale (it is to be remembered Mason CJ, Wilson, Gaudron JJ constituted a majority) circumstantial evidence of similar facts has probative value only if it bears no reasonable explanation other than the happening of the events in issue. In cases where there is a possibility of joint concoction there is another rational view of the evidence reasonably open. In such a case the alternate rational view, being reasonable open, is inconsistent with both the guilt of the accused and the improbability of the complainants concocting similar lies. Their Honours held that “It thus destroys the probative value of the evidence which is a condition precedent to its admissibility.” ( Hock (ante) at p. 296). 37. On the evidence before me, deliberate concoction by Karina M and Kirsten M in respect of each’s assertion the accused’s engaged in a ruse by pretending to be asleep is not reasonably open. In those circumstances I regard the joinder of all three complainants in the same indictment as being open to the Crown; I decline the application to severe the charges. Further, I permit the Crown to lead as tendency or coincidence evidence the circumstances of the accused pretending to be asleep.

    3 HALL J: The applicant, Todd William Carney, seeks leave to appeal pursuant to s.5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) against the severity of sentences imposed upon him by the District Court of New South Wales on 22 November 2007. 
     
      
       
      Offences charged 
       
      
    4 The applicant was charged and pleaded guilty to one count of discharging a firearm with intent to prevent lawful apprehension (contrary to the then s.33A(1), Crimes Act 1900), one count of unauthorised use of a firearm (contrary to s.7A(1), Firearms Act 1996) and one count of unauthorised possession of a firearm (contrary to s. 36(1) of the Firearms Act 1996). 
     
      
    5 The three offences, to which the applicant plead guilty, were in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: 
         That on 26 December 2006 at Miller in the State of New South Wales the [applicant] did maliciously discharge a loaded firearm with intent to prevent the lawful apprehension of himself. [then  
        Crimes Act 
         1900, s.33A – maximum penalty 14 years imprisonment] 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: 
         That on 26 December 2006 at Miller in the State of New South Wales he did use a firearm, namely a Winchester Centre Fire calibre Savage Model Sporter repeating rifle without being authorised to do so. [ 
        Firearms Act 
         1996, s.7A(1) - maximum penalty five years imprisonment] 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: 
         That on 26 December 2006 at Miller in the State of New South Wales he did possess a firearm namely a .25 – 20 Winchester Centre Fire calibre Savage Model Sporter repeating rifle which was not registered. [ 
        Firearms Act 
         1996, s.7A(1) - maximum penalty five years imprisonment] 
        
       
       
      Sentences imposed 
       
      
    6 The sentences imposed were in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1:  
        A non-parole period of three years and six months commencing 26 December 2006 and expiring on 25 June 2010, with a balance of term of two years and six months commencing 26 June 2010 and expiring on 25 December 2012. [This sentence took into account the matter on the Form 1, that being a charge of possessing ammunition contrary to s.65(3) of the  
        Firearms Act 
         1996.] 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: 
         A fixed term of imprisonment of six months commencing 26 December 2006 and expiring on 25 June 2007. 
         
         
        Count 3: 
         A fixed term of imprisonment of six months commencing 26 December 2006 and expiring on 25 June 2007. 
        
       
      
    7 The applicant was, accordingly, sentenced to an effective non-parole period of three years and six months with a balance of term of two years and six months. The sentences imposed for Counts 2 and 3 were concurrent with one another and fully subsumed in the non-parole period imposed in respect of Count 1. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    8 In the Notice of Application for Leave to Appeal, dated 13 June 2008, the applicant stated that he relied on the following grounds of appeal:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The sentencing judge erred in finding that objectively this case was close to the worst case. 
       
       
      (2) The sentencing judge erred in finding that the operation of general deterrence was only slightly ameliorated in the circumstances of this case. 
       
       
      (3) The sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of this case. 
       
       
      (4) His Honour’s findings in respect of the applicant’s mental illness. 
       
       
      Facts  
       
      
    9 The three offences were committed on the same day, that being the 26 December 2006. As acknowledged by the submissions for the applicant, the facts were the subject of agreement with the Crown tendering an agreed statement of facts at the sentencing hearing before the District Court. It is convenient to summarise and reproduce portions of the agreed facts, and I do so below. 
     
      
    10 At about 9.05 pm, on 26 December 2006, a highway patrol vehicle observed the applicant driving his motor vehicle along the M2 Motorway in excess of the speed limit. 
     
      
    11 The police attempted to stop the applicant by activating their warning lights; the applicant, however, continued to speed. When the police activated their sirens, the offender accelerated and a police pursuit ensued. 
     
      
    12 During the pursuit, the applicant turned onto the M7 Motorway, overtaking vehicles and travelling at speeds between 110 kilometres per hour and 165 kilometres per hour.  
     
      
    13 A Police helicopter also commenced pursuit of the applicant. 
     
      
    14 The applicant continued travelling at speed. During his drive, he travelled through two red traffic signals and drove on the incorrect side of the road on three occasions, narrowly missing an oncoming vehicle on one of these occasions. 
     
      
    15 The applicant turned left at the T-Way at Miller before stopping adjacent to a bus shelter. There was a bus containing passengers stopped at the shelter. The two constables in the patrol vehicle drove up towards where the offender had stopped. 
     
      
    16 The applicant took a rifle from the car he had been driving and ran through a vacant area of land next to the T-Way, with the two constables giving chase on foot until realising that the applicant was carrying a firearm. 
     
      
    17 One constable yelled out “stop police, stop police”. The two constables took cover behind the police vehicle. (Another police vehicle had also pulled up with a sergeant of police similarly taking cover behind his vehicle.) 
     
      
    18 The applicant turned and aimed the rifle in the direction of the two constables. He fired a number of rounds towards the police with one projectile striking the roof of the police car (above the front passenger’s door) and another shattering the rear window. 
     
      
    19 Later, the applicant walked to the opposite side of the paddock about 50 to 60 metres away, commenced pacing and further fired at the police who were crouched behind the patrol vehicles.  
     
      
    20 The police observed the applicant point the firearm in the direction of the police helicopter and saw a muzzle flash from the firearm. 
     
      
    21 During the shooting, the applicant reloaded his firearm. Further, whilst the gunfire exchange took place, passengers were trapped on the bus until the police broke the emergency window on the bus to evacuate the passengers. 
     
      
    22 At around 9.53 pm, following telephone contact between the applicant and his brother and police (the applicant’s brother was in the presence of police at the time of taking the call), the applicant dropped his rifle. He was subsequently arrested without further incident. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    23 The facts found by the sentencing judge as to the events producing the offences were those reflected in the agreed statement of facts (Exhibit A).  
     
      
    24 Given that Count 1 was by far the most serious of the three offences, his Honour’s sentencing remarks appropriately focussed upon that offence. 
     
      
    25 The sentencing judge stated that he accepted the Crown’s submissions as to the objective seriousness of the offence. His Honour accepted that the applicant directed his firearm at the police vehicles and discharged the firearm in circumstances “carrying a real risk the bullet could either have struck a residence or person in the surrounding residential area”. His Honour further accepted as relevant to his assessment of the objective gravity of the offence in Count 1 that the applicant fired a number of rounds at police and that he had over 82 unused rounds of ammunition when arrested. The considerations to which he referred led the sentencing judge to making the finding that the objective seriousness of the offence was not far removed from a case in the worst category. 26 As to the subjective circumstances of the applicant, his Honour noted that he had no criminal history and was otherwise of good character. Additionally, as a mitigating factor, his Honour determined that the applicant had pleaded guilty at what should be taken to be the earliest opportunity, leading him to apply a 25% discount to the sentence that would otherwise be imposed. 
     
      
    27 An important subjective circumstance of the offender (to which the sentencing judge had regard) was the applicant’s “emotional disturbance” at the time of the offence. His Honour considered that there was “ample evidence” suggesting the applicant was suffering schizophrenia at the time of the offence, he having been diagnosed soon after incarceration. In addressing the issue of the applicant’s mental health, the sentencing judge had regard to the opinion of Professor David Mace Greenberg in his report dated 2 October 2007 that the applicant’s paranoia, his disinhibition from the alcohol consumed that day and his depressed mood may have contributed to his poor judgment at the time of the offences.  
     
      
    28 The sentencing judge found that the applicant’s likelihood of re-offending was remote and that special circumstances existed on the basis of the applicant’s prior good character and prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    29 In determining the sentence to be imposed, in view of the applicant’s mental illness, the sentencing judge considered that the principle of general deterrence was “marginally” less important than otherwise might be the case. His Honour referred to the dicta in the well-known decision in Regina v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255, referring to a mentally disordered person’s diminished appreciation of the wrongfulness of his or her actions as a special consideration upon sentencing. 
     
      
    30 However, his Honour stated that in sentencing the applicant, he “was not prepared to abandon the principles of general deterrence by any stretch of the imagination”. He emphasised there was a “need to protect the public from other citizens like-minded to offend” and that, as submitted by the Crown before him, the “element of public safety” (that is, jeopardising the safety of the residents and the police) was an aggravating feature.  
     
      
    31 Absent the applicant’s emotional instability, the sentencing judge stated that he would have adopted a starting sentence of 10 years imprisonment. Instead, his Honour considered a starting head sentence of 8 years imprisonment to be appropriate, with this term then reduced by the twenty five percent discount for the early plea to six years imprisonment. As earlier noted, a non-parole period of three years and six months was imposed.  
     
      
       
      (1) 
        
      Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred in finding that objectively this case was close to the worst case 
      
    32 Ms A Francis of counsel who appeared on behalf of the applicant, submitted that the sentencing judge had erred in finding that the offence in question was close to falling within the worst category of case. 
     
      
    33 Reliance was placed upon the fact that the applicant had discharged the firearm with an intent to prevent his lawful apprehension rather than with an intent to do grievous bodily harm (either of these intentions being sufficient to form the mental element for an offence contrary to s. 33A of the Crimes Act then in force). Ms Francis observed that it was not part of the Crown case that the applicant had intended to commit grievous bodily harm or any lesser kind of injury. The submissions noted that the sentencing judge had not been taken to the terms of (the then) s. 33A, Crimes Act.  
     
      
    34 Whilst it was noted that the sentencing judge had accepted the evidence of applicant’s mental illness, Ms Francis contended that his Honour’s starting sentence of eight years was productive of latent error. 
     
      
    35 The Crown, relying upon the observations of Spigelman CJ in Regina v Mulato [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], emphasised that the categorisation of the objective seriousness of an offence is a matter for the evaluation of the sentencing judge. It contended that the sentencing judge appropriately had regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively and that the applicant’s behaviour in discharging a firearm in the circumstances referred to above could have led to grievous bodily harm or even death. In those circumstances, the Crown contended that it was open to his Honour to find that “this was close to a worse case” and that a starting point of eight years was appropriate. 
     
      
    36 I am of the opinion that the sentencing judge did correctly evaluate the objective seriousness of the offence in Count 1 as falling within the higher range. The discharge of the firearm in the direction of police located at ground level and in the helicopter made the offence one of the utmost gravity. When regard is had to the maximum penalty for an offence under s.33A(1) to be 14 years, I do not see any error in the evaluation of the objective seriousness of the offence in Count 1. 
     
      
       
      (2) Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred in finding that the operation of general deterrence was only slightly ameliorated in the circumstances of this case 
       
      
    37 Ms Francis acknowledged that it is for a sentencing judge to assess the extent to which the operation of general deterrence may be moderated in any given case involving a mentally disordered offender. Nonetheless, it was submitted for the applicant that it was “difficult” to appreciate why his Honour, as stated in the sentencing remarks, considered only slight amelioration of the principle of general deterrence was warranted in view of the applicant’s mental state. 
     
      
    38 Ms Francis submitted that in the circumstances of the case, the question of general deterrence had little role to play in the sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    39 Reference was made in support to Regina v Anderson [1981] VR 155; (1980) 2 A Crim R 379,  Regina v Scognamiglio (1991) 56 A Crim R 81, Regina v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 and Regina v Pitt [2005] NSWCCA 304 in relation to the proposition that general deterrence is often accorded little weight when sentencing persons suffering from serious mental illness. 
     
      
    40 The Crown, in its submissions, emphasised the gravity of the offence and that deterrence was important in sentencing for crimes of violence on the street and in public places generally. In the present case, the Crown emphasised the actions of the applicant placed the lives of police officers at risk as well as members of the public. 
     
      
    41 Whilst acknowledging the fact that where an offender suffered from a mental illness or disability at the time of an offence and that this may mitigate the culpability of the offender and result in less weight being attached to the factor of general deterrence, the Crown emphasised the need to examine the particular circumstances in each case. 
     
      
    42 It contended in this respect that the applicant in this case at the time of the offence knew what he was doing and was aware of the gravity of his action. The Crown, however, acknowledged the medical evidence which supported the proposition that the applicant’s paranoia, inter alia, may have had a contributing role to his poor judgment at the time surrounding the offence in Count 1. It contended that it was clear that the sentencing judge had kept well in mind the relevance and the significance of the applicant’s mental state and relevant principles. 
     
      
    43 I am of the opinion that his Honour was in error in stating, in effect, that the operation of general deterrence in this case was to be only marginally reduced. In that respect, whilst acknowledging the principle of general deterrence in cases such as the present, his Honour stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… I recognise that, but again I state that because of the emotional instability of the prisoner at the time of these events, I think the question of general deterrence  
        does assume slightly less importance  
        than might otherwise be the case.” 
         (emphases added) 
        
       
      
    44 I will return later in this judgment to the significance of this aspect of the sentencing judge’s approach to the ultimate sentence imposed in respect of Count 1. 
     
      
      (3) Ground 3: The sentence is manifestly excessive in the circumstances of this case 
       
      
    45 The applicant contended that the sentence imposed upon him was manifestly excessive in the circumstances of the case. Specifically, it was submitted that having regard to the “unusual circumstances” of the case, a starting sentence of eight years (before discount), where the maximum penalty is 14 years, was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    46 Ms Francis acknowledged that in sentencing mentally disordered offenders, the principles of specific deterrence and the protection of the public may take on greater significance (thus counterbalancing any reduced emphasis on general deterrence). It was, however, contended for the applicant that the circumstances of this case were not such as to require any greater importance being ascribed to those two factors. In this respect, it was emphasised that the offences were the applicant’s first acts of criminality committed in circumstances in which he lacked awareness of his mental illness and that his alcohol and drug abuse were symptoms of such illness. 
     
      
    47 The Crown submitted that, in considering this ground, it was necessary to bear in mind that the overall sentences of six years with a non-parole period of three years and six months took into account a matter on a Form 1, namely, possess ammunition contrary to s.65(3), Firearms Act 1996 and sentences of fixed terms of imprisonment of six months for two other firearm offences under s.7A(1) and s.36(1) of the Act to be served concurrently. 
     
      
    48 Apart from the maximum penalty for an offence under s.33A(1) of 14 years, the maximum penalty for each of the firearm offences is five years. 
     
      
    49 The Crown submitted that the sentence imposed was well within the permissible sentencing range given the objective seriousness of the offences and the need for general deterrence (albeit reduced in this case). It contended that no lesser sentence is warranted in law and that the appeal should be dismissed: s.6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    50 I will return to the question of “manifest excess” below. 
     
      
      (4) Ground 4: His Honour’s findings in respect of the applicant’s mental illness 
       
      
    51 It is evident from the remarks on sentence that the sentencing judge found that the applicant was suffering “in some way” from schizophrenia at the time of the offences and that his “emotional instability [at that time] … had some effect upon these events [giving rise to the offences]”.  
     
      
    52 His Honour, as earlier noted, considered that the applicant’s paranoia and depressed mood as well as his disinhibition owing to the alcohol consumed may have contributed to his poor judgment at that time. His Honour found that the immediate explanation for the applicant’s refusal to pull over when directed by police was his state of intoxication and his possession of an unloaded rifle. Nonetheless, he also found that the applicant’s judgment was “clouded” by reason of his paranoia and depression. I find no error in his Honour’s approach or finding in respect of the nature or extent of the applicant’s mental illness. 
     
      
    53 In order to determine whether the sentences imposed were reasonably proportionate to the applicant’s offending, I turn to the principles to be considered in that respect. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    54 It is well accepted principle that, whereas general deterrence is a relevant consideration in every sentencing exercise, it is a consideration to which less weight should be given in the case of an offender suffering from a mental disorder or severe intellectual handicap: Regina v Letteri (per Badgery-Parker J) cited by Gleeson CJ in Engert (supra). 
     
      
    55 The reason for this approach was referred to by Wood CJ at CL in Regina v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [254] in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “The reason for this approach lies in the circumstances that the community will readily understand that the offender who suffers from a mental disorder or abnormality is left in control of his or her cognitive facilities or emotional restraints, and in some instances lacks the ability to make reasoned or ordered judgments. Almost invariably there is a limited appreciation of the wrongfulness of the act, or of its moral culpability, which although falling short of avoiding criminal responsibility does not justify special consideration upon sentencing. Moreover, such condition is inherent and its presence does not depend upon any element of choice.” 
        
       
      
    56 See also Israil (supra) at [21] per Spigelman CJ. In that case, Spigelman CJ observed that mental illness may not only impact on the sentencing exercise by less weight being given to the issue of general deterrence but additionally, to the extent that mental illness explains the offence, then an offender’s inability to understand the wrongfulness of his actions, or to make reasonable judgments, or to control his or her faculties or emotions “… will impact on the level of culpability of the offender, even where the illness does not amount to an excuse at law” (at [23]). 
     
      
    57 The Chief Justice also there expressly agreed with the following observations of Malcolm CJ in Regina v Lauritsen [2000] WASCA 203; (2000) 114 A Crim R 333 at [48]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… mental illness is not only relevant to assessing culpability, in which case it must be shown to have contributed to the offence, but it is also relevant to assessing the level of danger the offender presents and the appropriate way in which the offender is to be rehabilitated. The mental illness should be taken into account in sentencing whether or not it played a part in the commission of the offence, but not with the consequence of the imposition of a sentence which exceeds the seriousness of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    58 Apart from the issue of general deterrence, the effects of mental disorder or abnormality in terms of the ability to control cognitive faculties or emotional restraints or in the exercise of reasonable or ordered judgments are also to be considered in relation to the issue of personal or specific deterrence. This is particularly so where the disability or limited intellectual functioning is such that the offender may not fully appreciate, or understand, the nature of his or her offending, or of the message, which the sentence is expected to convey: Regina v Matthews [2004] NSWCCA 112; (2004) 145 A Crim R 445 per Wood CJ at CL at [23]. See also Regina v Scognamiglio (supra); Anderson (supra) at 160 to 161; (1980) 2 A Crim R 379 at 383 to 384; Regina v Champion (1992) 64 A Crim R 244 and Regina v Kilmartin (1989) 41 A Crim R 22. 
     
      
    59 In Matthews (supra), Wood CJ at CL emphasised at [26] that each case will depend upon the nature and degree of the impairment, the extent of its contribution to the offence, and whether or not the sentence can be seen, in the particular circumstances, of that case to have a deterrent value, either specifically or generally. 
     
      
    60 The Crown referred to the principles as restated by the Victorian Court of Appeal in The Queen v Verdins [2007] VSCA 102 at [32] (Maxwell P, Buchanan and Vincent JJA) in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Impaired mental functioning, whether temporary or permanent (‘the condition’), is relevant to sentencing in at least the following six ways:- 
        
       
       
        
        1. The condition may reduce the moral culpability of the offending conduct, as distinct from the offender’s legal responsibility. Where that is so, the condition affects the punishment that is just in all the circumstances; and denunciation is less likely to be a relevant sentencing objective. 
        
       
       
        
        2. The condition may have a bearing on the kind of sentence that is imposed and the conditions in which it should be served. 
        
       
       
        
        3. Whether general deterrence should be moderated or eliminated as a sentencing consideration depends upon the nature and severity of the symptoms exhibited by the offender, and the effect of the condition on the mental capacity of the offender, whether at the time of the offending or at the date of sentence, or both. 
        
       
       
        
        4. Whether specific deterrence should be moderated or eliminated as a sentencing consideration likewise depends upon the nature and severity of the symptoms of the condition as exhibited by the offender, and the effect of the condition on the mental capacity of the offender, whether at the time of the offending or at the date of sentence, or both. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The existence of the condition as at the date of sentencing (or its foreseeable recurrence) may mean that a given sentence will weigh more heavily on the offender than it would on a person in normal health. 
        
       
       
        
        6. Where there is a serious risk of imprisonment having a significant adverse effect on the offender’s mental health, this will be a factor tending to mitigate punishment.” 
        
       
      
    61 Finally, it is only necessary to add, however, the observation of Howie J in Courtney v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 195; (2007) 172 A Crim R 371 at [83], namely, that, even though mental illness may reduce a person’s culpability, that does not necessarily result in a lesser sentence. 
     
      
    62 In the present case, the Crown acknowledged that the applicant suffered from a mental illness but it contended that it was clear that he, at the time of the offences, knew what he was doing and was aware of the gravity of his action. The applicant stated to police, as recorded in the record of interview, that when he heard the police sirens “I was over the limit and what I had possession of” (the loaded rifle). This was consistent with the note made by Professor Greenberg in his report that the applicant had told him that his reason “… for taking off from the Police was that he knew that he had been drinking alcohol and had a loaded rifle in his motor car” (p.5). 
     
      
    63 The Crown also observed that there is no evidence of a risk of adverse effect of imprisonment on the applicant. He had been in custody for approximately 11 months as at the date of sentence and no adverse impact to his mental health had arisen as indicated by Dr Nielssen’s statement that, at the time of interview, he had largely recovered from the acute phase of mental illness. 
     
      
    64 The facts established by the evidence in this case that are relevant to the nature and degree of the impairment, the extent of its contribution to the offences, and whether or not the sentences imposed can be seen, in the circumstances of the case, to be reasonably proportionate to the criminality involved and to have a deterrent value (either specifically or generally) include the following:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The applicant at the time of the offences was suffering from paranoid schizophrenia. That condition had developed over the course of the preceding 12 months and was associated with the use of illicit substances including, from about April 2006, crystal methamphetamine. 
       
       
      (2) The delusional beliefs from which the applicant suffered arose from the illogical interpretation of events rather than as secondary to auditory hallucinations. 
       
       
      (3) Other aspects of the applicant’s intellectual function were preserved. 
       
       
      (4) The delusional belief persisted despite the withdrawal of drugs known to induce psychotic illness following his arrest (thereby ruling out a purely drug induced psychosis). 
       
       
      (5) The events associated with the applicant’s offending giving rise to the offences in question represented his first episode of psychotic illness and, accordingly, there had been no previous experience of remission from symptoms due to treatment. Additionally, he had not had the benefit of a medical explanation for the symptoms that led him to attend a police station and then at Liverpool Hospital in June 2006. 
       
       
      (6) The medical evidence established that the applicant’s paranoid mood state at the time of the alleged offences played a significant role in his poor judgment. 
       
       
      (7) His paranoia, his disinhibition by having consumed alcohol and his depressed mood were identified as possible contributors to the applicant’s poor judgment at the time surrounding the offences. 
       
       
      (8) He had an awareness of what he was doing was wrong. 
       
      
    65 The medical evidence supports the conclusion that, although he had such an awareness, the paranoid condition nonetheless played a role by impairing the applicant’s capacity for making reasonable judgments and from controlling his behaviour. These last two mentioned matters impact on his level of culpability: Israil (supra) at [23]. 
     
      
    66 As this is a case in which the applicant’s intellectual functioning was not completely impaired by the psychotic episode thereby enabling him to have an appreciation of the wrongful nature of his conduct, it cannot be said that personal or specific deterrence was an unimportant issue on sentence. I consider that specific deterrence as a relevant sentencing issue in this case would serve to reinforce on the applicant that, in order to avoid being drawn into re-offending again in the future, a strict adherence to his medication regime is essential. If he does abide by the regime prescribed for him, the evidence indicates that his risk of re-offending will be low. 
     
      
    67 In summary, it is apparent, in my opinion, that the two matters of significance in determining the sentence in this case were, firstly, the objective gravity of the offence in Count 1 and, secondly, the need for the sentence to adequately give effect to the principles of specific deterrence. The latter is plainly important both in the applicant’s interest in controlling his life and in the interests of the community. 
     
      
    68 I am of the opinion that the sentence imposed was proportionate to the criminality involved in the offences. Although the sentencing judge appears not to have appropriately moderated the sentence for Count 1 in terms of general deterrence in accordance with established principle, I, nonetheless, consider that that one aspect in the sentencing process, on the particular facts of this case, was at least counter-balanced by the matters to which I have referred. The sentences imposed, accordingly, were, in my opinion a proper exercise of the sentencing discretion and no lesser sentence is warranted in law. 
     
      
    69 Accordingly, the orders I would propose are:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Leave to appeal be granted. 
       
       
      (2) The appeal be dismissed.

   Introduction1. These are proceedings for damages commenced by the plaintiff (by way of Statement of Claim filed on 3 August 2007) for injuries she suffered at Pendle Hill Railway Station on 27 October 2006 when she attempted to board a train. 2. The issues in dispute in these proceedings are the following: 
     
     (a) the circumstances in which the plaintiff was injured; 
      
     (b) if liability can be established, whether the plaintiff was contributorily negligent;  
      
     (c) issues of causation; and 
      
     (d) the quantum of damages to be awarded. 
    3. I will first consider the evidence relating to the circumstances of the plaintiff’s accident.The Accident on 27 October 20064. The plaintiff is a 58 year old woman who was born in Lebanon. She has lived in Australia since 1974. She is divorced and lives with her 26 year old son, who suffers from Tourette’s syndrome. The plaintiff is on a disability pension, which she said in her evidence was because she has bilateral carpal tunnel, a condition unrelated to the accident. The plaintiff is able to speak English but clearly had difficulties with the unfamiliarity of the courtroom setting, and gave her evidence through an Arabic interpreter. She was at times nervous and some of her evidence was, to use Mr Reoch’s description in his submissions, dramatic, but I have taken into account the warnings of the Court of Appeal in Goodrich Aerospace Pty Ltd v Arsic [2006] NSWCA 187 concerning the dangers of misreading cultural factors into demeanour findings. 5. The plaintiff described how her accident occurred as follows. On the day in question she notices, as she went down the stairs towards the station, that the train she wanted to catch had just arrived on the platform. She waved to the train guard, who she noticed was talking on the phone, to get his attention. She called out, from her position whilst standing on the last step of the railway staircase: “I’m going to buy a ticket”. She said the guard replied “I’ll wait for you”. 6. The plaintiff then bought her ticket, came back to the train and put her right foot onto the train. Suddenly, she said, the doors closed. The other passengers started shouting for the train doors to be opened, and she felt the train about to move or actually move off. One of her legs had fallen between the train and the platform. She thought she was going to be killed. The doors then opened and the guard came to see her, holding his mobile phone in his hand. 7. The plaintiff said that the guard helped her up. She asked if she could be taken to the toilet, where she checked herself to see if she was all right. She then returned to the train and travelled to Parramatta to report the injury. She said the train guard “apologised for the mistake, about what happened”, and gave her his name on a piece of paper, as well as arranging for her to see the Manager at the Parramatta station.8. In cross-examination, the plaintiff repeated her evidence that she came down the stairs and heard the train coming in, half way down, seeing it stop when she was on the last step. She knew that she had to buy a ticket and she said “I made sure he [the train guard] promised to wait before I bought my ticket”. She thought the guard was about one carriage length away on the train. The plaintiff agreed that she had heard the announcement about the doors closing on her way down the stairway, and said that was why she asked the guard to wait.9. In cross-examination the plaintiff said the train guard told her, while they were in the train later, that he was worried he would lose his job because of his negligence. He said he had been talking on the phone to his wife, who had just had a baby. He gave her a paper with his name on it.10. The plaintiff’s version of events as set out in the evidence above differs significantly from the CCTV film, her description of the accident to doctors and the evidence of the witnesses called by the defendant. I shall consider each of these in turn.The CCTV film11. The plaintiff was shown the CCTV film of her accident. This video recording is helpfully described in the Assessment report of Dr Johnson (23 May 2008, page 5) as follows: 
     
     “I noted a number of people waiting for a train on the platform and when the train arrived, these people got on and a number of other people alighted. The train guard could be easily seen hanging out of the train door waiting until everyone had got on or off. A considerable way off, I saw a woman who could have been Ms Alam, but I could not be sure of this, run out from a door and attempted to get onto the train through a door which was still open. She appeared to fall onto the platform and the guard alighted from the train and ran to assist this woman who immediately regained her feet. The woman and the guard walked along the platform towards the guard’s door while in conversation. The guard got into train [sic] and the woman walked through a door in the station and later returned walking rapidly and got into the train. The guard remained waiting at the door until this woman got into the train before the train doors closed and the train left the station. 
      
      
     If this was a recording of the alleged motor vehicle accident [sic] affecting Ms Alam on 30 October 2006 [this being the date the plaintiff originally gave for the accident], then this would contradict her version of the events.” 
    12. The CCTV shows the following: 
     
     (a) the train arrives on the station 3 seconds after the film starts. 
      
     (b) the train comes to a stop 15 seconds later.  
      
     (c) People alight from the train and get on. The last passenger seen to get on (although not all passengers can be seen) has done so by 30 seconds. 
      
     (d) The plaintiff appears very briefly at 32 seconds and immediately turns around to walk back into the station. 
      
     (e) The platform is empty by 55 seconds. 
      
     (f) The plaintiff reappears on the platform at 60 seconds and is seen entering the train and with the doors shutting on her leg in the following 2 – 3 seconds. 
    These are the times given when I watched the CCTV on my computer. They vary slightly from the times given by the plaintiff’s counsel in his submissions, probably for technical reasons. Counsel for the plaintiff’s assertion that the CCTV is “valuably marked by the defendant itself as to the time sequence of what happened” is, as the plaintiff points out in paragraph 8, not accurate. However, any differences are comparatively small.13. The CCTV footage does not show any discussion or eye contact between the plaintiff and the guard, nor does it show her waving to him. He does not appear to be holding a mobile phone or talking on it. She appears very suddenly and without warning, about 30 seconds after the other passengers had all got onto the train, and the train doors must have been about to close because they close on her as she attempts to enter.14. The plaintiff continued to insist, after being shown the CCTV footage in cross-examination, that her accident occurred the way she described.15. Both the plaintiff and defendant in submissions pointed to problems in how the CCTV footage should be analysed; these are set out in more detail below. However, on any analysis, the plaintiff’s account and the CCTV are inconsistent and I have set out below the reasons why I reject the plaintiff’s counsel’s submissions that the CCTV is corroborative of the plaintiff’s account of the accident.Description of injury to medical practitioners16. The plaintiff told Dr Guirgis, according to his report of 22 February 2008, that the train door had closed on her left shoulder and the train started to move. The plaintiff told Dr Maxwell, according to his report of 5 November 2007, that when she was stepping onto the train the door closed on her foot, the train started and this caused her body to be slightly twisted. She lost her balance and she fell on her back.17. Her description to the Medical Assessment Service was different yet again: 
     
     “On 30 October 2006 Ms Alam was getting onto a train at to [sic] Pendle Hill Railway Station, when the doors of the train closed over her right leg. She fell backwards and her left leg slipped between the train and the platform. The train briefly commenced to move and then stopped when some of the passengers raised the alarm. The driver opened the doors and she fell backwards onto her back. After speaking to the Station Manager, who apologised for the accident, she was sent home by taxi.” (Page 3) 
    18. Dr Johnson notes (page 4) that this version is at variance with other reports, as well as with the CCTV footage.19. Up until the plaintiff was shown the CCTV film, the plaintiff had maintained a version of the accident, involving the doors closing on her leg, the train moving off, people screaming to the train driver and the train then stopping. The most significant difference between the plaintiff’s version before seeing the CCTV and afterwards was that she no longer maintained the train moved off but she continued to maintain that there were people screaming when her leg got caught.20. The defendant, in written submissions (paragraph 21) notes that none of these people can be seen coming forward to help her, but very little turns on this.Other evidenceThe train guard and the ticket seller21. Mr Clift, the train guard, gave evidence of his recollection of the events in question. He gave a careful and precise account of what occurred.22. He denied that he was using a mobile phone to telephone anyone and the mobile telephone records tendered for his State Rail Authority mobile phone confirm this.23. Perhaps more importantly, he informed the Court that he was 48 years old, and that his wife was 47 years of age. Far from being a wife who had recently given birth to a baby, his wife had in fact divorced him in September, the month before the accident, and he had no children from this marriage.24. Mr Clift’s account of the accident is consistent with the CCTV film. He clearly had no conversation with the plaintiff, and was not waved to by her as she claims. Before commencing to close the train doors he looked to see if it was safe to do so, pressed the button to play the warning to show the doors were about to close, returned to look again, blew a whistle and looked again, in particular to the area which he knew was likely to be the source of late passenger activity, namely the stairs down which the plaintiff had come. During all this time the plaintiff was not in sight.25. He described the plaintiff as darting out to try to board the train and he saw her fall. This is confirmed by the CCTV footage. He acted promptly by hitting the re-open button, over which his fingers had been hovering because that was the usual practice. He reached her very quickly and helped her to her feet.26. Mr Clift’s evidence is corroborated by Mr Gregory, who said that the plaintiff hurriedly left the ticket office after receiving her ticket and that he heard the sound which he associated with the doors closing on the train at the time that he was handing the plaintiff her ticket. He saw the doors closing on carriages of the train further along the platform which would confirm that Mr Clift had already hit the door closing button. It is hardly surprising that Mr Gregory was able to recall this event, given that this resulted in an accident on his station involving a passenger to whom he had just sold a ticket.27. The distance the plaintiff traversed was agreed by the parties to be approximately 3 metres (see defendant’s written submissions, paragraph 26).The use to which CCTV footage should be put28. The CCTV footage provides assistance, but the defendant submitted it was of limited evidentiary value. 29. From the CCTV footage, it would appear that the plaintiff got some part of her body onto the train, probably one of her legs, and that this occurred at about the middle of the doorway to the train. The likelihood is that the doors did close on her right leg as the plaintiff said. 30. The plaintiff submits that the CCTV does not support the contention that the plaintiff “darted out”. I do not accept this submission. The plaintiff’s movements are quick. She looks like a person rushing to catch a train. She moves more quickly than the other persons who are shown on the CCTV entering the train carriage. 31. The defendant notes that on the plaintiff’s evidence the train doors had reached the point where she could only insert one leg before the doors closed. This gives an indication of the time lapse between the giving of signals that the doors were to close and the doors closing.32. A challenge was mounted by the defendant to the admissibility of the CCTV, and I shall now deal with the challenge to the adequacy of the CCTV evidence.Objection to the tender of the defendant’s CCTV footage33. Before the trial commenced, the defendant objected to the tender of the CCTV footage, which it had produced in answer to a subpoena. Counsel for the defendant submitted that recent Court of Appeal authority prevented the tender of such material unless its provenance could be established in evidence, and that such evidence, if tendered, could be used as evidence of the truth of events but only as corroboration. (The provenance issue was not pursued after counsel for the plaintiff produced a letter from the defendant concerning this issue.)34. The two decisions relied upon by the defendant were Blacktown City Council v Hocking (2008) Aust Torts Reports ¶81-956; [2008] NSWCA 144 and Angel v Hawkesbury City Council [2008] NSWCA 130.35. In Blacktown City Council v Hocking Spigelman CJ noted: 
     
     “ 
     [6]  
     Accordingly, any errors that might have occurred at the time of construction would have arisen with respect to the defects at the two short ends of the pit as they appeared in 2002. For the reasons given by Tobias JA, those defects could not be found to have existed seven or eight years before on the basis of visual inspection of the 2002 photographs, without expert evidence. 
      
      
     [7]  
     Tobias JA sets out the authorities which consider the use of photographs by a trial judge. It is not entirely clear in what circumstances photographs can be used as direct evidence, as distinct from explicating the evidence otherwise given. 
      
      
     [8]  
     As Young J said in  
     Beaton v McDivitt 
      (1985) 13 NSWLR 134 at 142–143: 
      
      
      
      … it seems to me that the law is a little unclear as to just what use may be made of photographs tendered at a trial. In a criminal trial, photographs of the victim may be tendered to enable the jury to understand the medical evidence: see, eg,  
      R v Lobendahn 
       (1980) 5 Petty Sessions Review 2484. Even if photographs are tendered in a motor car accident case, it may be that without concession the photographs can only be used by the judge as descriptive of what the witness who tendered them saw, and that the judge cannot himself make deductions from them: see, eg,  
      Schmidt v Schmidt 
       [1969] QWN 3. However, in  
      R v Ames 
       [1964-5] NSWR 1489 at 1491, the Court of Criminal Appeal seems to me to have made a greater use of the photograph than merely to use it to understand the evidence because their Honours said: 
      
      
      … the photographs … did have some probative value, as distinct from an oral description of what they depicted … They depict the direction of the flow of blood on to the clothing and establish the presence of blood on the mouth … 
      
      
     Very often in equity, photographs are tendered from the Bar table without a witness in the box to give complementary oral evidence, and in my view, when this happens, consistently with  
     R v Ames 
     , the judge treats the photographs as evidence and not merely as material to understand the evidence. 
      
      
     [9]  
     Schmidt v Schmidt 
      [1969] QWN 3 was an appeal from the Queensland District Court to the Full Court of the Supreme Court of Queensland. Douglas J, with whom Hart and Lucas JJ agreed, made certain obiter observations on the use of photographs for the purpose of making deductions of fact. His Honour said at 6: 
      
      
      
      [The primary judge] based a large part of his judgment on what he saw in [the photographs]. He was not entitled to use them in the way he did. He proceeded to make deductions of fact which on the evidence it was not competent for him to make. The greater part of his deductions made from the photographs can be described as conjectural, and to the extent that he used them as a basis for his findings they must be rejected. 
      
      
     [10]  
     Douglas J (at 5) cites as authority for his findings Wigmore on Evidence (3rd ed, 1940) Vol 3 at 174–175 which states: 
      
      
      
      … whenever such document is offered as proving a thing to be as therein represented, then it is offered testimonially, and it must be associated with a testifier. 
      
      
     Two consequences plainly follow. On the one hand, the mere picture or map itself cannot be received except as a non-verbal expression of the testimony of some witness competent to speak to the facts represented. On the other hand, it is immaterial whose hand prepared the thing, provided it is presented to the tribunal by a competent witness as a representation of his knowledge. 
      
      
     [11]  
     In the Chadbourn revision of this text — which was published in the year following  
     Schmidt 
      — the author appeared to recognise a broader role for photographs. After setting out the passage from the third edition, quoted above, the learned author added at 219–220: 
      
      
      
      This theory which has been aptly dubbed the ‘pictorial testimony theory of photographs’ was advanced in prior editions of this work as the only theoretical basis which could justify the receipt of photographs in evidence. With later advancements in the art of photography, however, and with increasing awareness of the manifold evidentiary uses of the products of the art, it has become clear that an additional theory of admissibility of photographs is entitled to recognition. Thus, even though no human is capable of swearing that he personally perceived what a photograph purports to portray … there may nevertheless be good warrant for receiving the photograph in evidence. Given an adequate foundation assuring the accuracy of the process producing it, the photograph should then be received as a so-called silent witness or as a witness which ‘speaks for itself’. 
      
      
     [12]  
     The author goes on to quote at length an American case in which this issue is discussed. ( 
     People v Bowley

     The use of photographic evidence has been the subject of discussion in this Court. Its admissibility as a visual reproduction is beyond doubt:  
     R v Travers 
      (1958) 58 SR (NSW) 85 at 108. However, in  
     Short v Barrett 
     , Court of Appeal, 5 October 1990 (unreported), Meagher JA, with the concurrence of Clarke and Handley JJA, observed that in relying on his own interpretation of photographic evidence, the trial judge had overlooked the “sage advice” of Lord Reid in  
     C Van der Lely NV v Bamfords Ltd 
      [1963] RPC 61 at 71. His Lordship said: 
      
      
      
      “Lawyers are expected to be experts in the use of the English language, but we are not experts in the reading or interpretation of photographs. The question is what the eye of the man with appropriate engineering skill and experience would see in the photograph, and that appears to me to be a matter for evidence. Where the evidence is contradictory the judge must decide. But the judge ought not, in my opinion, to attempt to read or construe the photograph himself; he looks at the photograph in determining which of the explanations given by the witnesses appears to be most worthy of acceptance.” 
      
      
     [168]  
     In  
     Stillwell Trucks Pty Ltd v McKay & Ors  
     [2002] NSWCA 292, Campbell AJA, with the agreement of Handley and Beazley JJA, also referred (at [71]–[72]) with approval to this passage from Lord Reid’s speech, observing that although his Lordship was concerned with a patent case concerning a hay rake and the issue was anticipation, the passage gave guidance on a wider basis. Campbell AJA then observed (at [73]): 
      
      
      
      In my view the use of other components in the photograph or series of photographs to identify objects in a photograph is an appropriate procedure. Upon occasion it may be a matter of common sense. In a case involving machinery parts, as here, it would normally require an expert to make the identification. 
      
      
     [169]  
     It should be noted that the use by a trial judge of photographs is nothing new. They can, as the authorities to which I have referred confirm, be descriptive of what a witness says he or she saw, being a representation of the witness’ knowledge and observations. But they should not be used by a judge to make findings of fact which are otherwise unsupported by the evidence and are therefore no more than conjectural:  
     Schmidt v Schmidt 
      [1969] QWN 3 at 6;  
     Beaton v McDivitt 
      (1985) 13 NSWLR 134 at 142. 
      
      
     [170]  
     Thus in  
     United States Shipping Board v The Ship St Albans 
      [1931] AC 632 Lord Merrivale, in delivering the advice of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, observed (at 642) that the use of photographic evidence must be the subject of “careful delineation” particularly as a means of proof of matters of fact. This is not to say that photographs can have no probative value of themselves even in the absence of an oral description of what is depicted; only that care must be taken to ensure that they are not used as the sole source from which a primary fact is to be inferred where that fact is not revealed on the face of the photographs such as the condition of a structure at a time significantly removed from that when the photographs were taken. 
      
      
     [171]  
     In my opinion the photographs in the present case obviously depict the condition of the pit at the time they were taken. Whether or not they indicate the presence of a lip at that time may well be a matter of common sense and common observation of the photographs. But her Honour did not merely use the photographs for the purpose of determining the condition of the pit and its lid at the time of the plaintiff’s accident. Such a use would have been perfectly legitimate. Rather, she sought to interpret them as establishing, apart from the collapsed side of the pit adjoining the grass verge, the condition of the lip or the lack of a lip around parts of the perimeter of the lid of the pit at the time the footpath was constructed some seven or eight years previously. She did so without the assistance of any expert evidence except, perhaps, that of Mr Garofali which did not establish the conclusion for which the plaintiff contended and her Honour accepted. This was impermissible. 
      
      
     [172]  
     In my view it required the evidence of an expert to so interpret the relevant photographs. In the absence of any such evidence, it was not open to her Honour to substitute her own view as a lay observer over the evidence of an expert. This being so, the consequence is that there was no evidence capable of supporting her Honour’s finding that the work carried out to the pit at the time the footpath was constructed left the pit without adequate support for its lid.” 
    37. As set out above, in Blacktown City Council v Hocking Tobias JA noted the admissibility of photographic evidence was “beyond doubt”. However, the defendant draws my attention to Tobias JA’s statement in Angel v Hawkesbury City Council at [67] – [72]: 
     
     “ 
     [67]  
     The Council sought to rely upon the photographs in evidence to demonstrate that, despite the shadowing, the differential in height at the join between the two slabs was obvious. However, in our view the photographs themselves are deceptive. Those taken at 12 noon on the day of the accident do not actually depict the location of the shadows as they were an hour and a half earlier, in respect of which there was the evidence of the two independent witnesses. 
      
      
     [68]  
     The thrust of the Council’s submissions based on the photographic evidence was that they made plain that the raised slab was visible at least from where the photographs were taken if not from further back. It was contended that at best the light was dappled so that at any given time the shadow cast by the trees did not cover the whole of the raised lip of the defective slab, notwithstanding that it tapered over its width. 
      
      
     [69]  
     Apart from the fact that this submission was at odds with the clear and unchallenged evidence of Ms Wilmington that the shadow was cast by the main trunk of the adjoining tree directly over the whole length of the joint between the two slabs, no proper basis was advanced as to why the photographs should trump the eyewitness evidence of not only Ms Wilmington but also Ms Coull. The fact is that a person walking along a footpath scanning ahead as the appellant said she did, would not suddenly stop at the point at which a photograph was taken and peer to see what was ahead of her. As was pointed by Beazley JA during the course of argument, the perspective depicted in photographs such as those in the present case, can be quite skewed and distances very difficult to assess. 
      
      
     [70]  
     The deceptive nature of such photographs is that they focus on a particular scene that is static. This is the antithesis of a pedestrian walking along a footpath, a situation that is anything but static and where the person is not required to focus on only one small element in the scene before and around him or her. When it comes to the best and most reliable evidence, that of the independent witnesses Ms Coull and Ms Wilmington must clearly prevail over photographs which were not taken until one and a half hours later. 
      
      
     [71]  
     In  
     Short v Barrett 
      [1990] NSWCA 164; unreported (BC9003193), Meagher JA, with the concurrence of Clarke and Handley JJA, considered that judges should not, when looking at photographs, overlook what his Honour referred to as the sage advice of Lord Reid in  
     C Van der Lely NV v Bamfords Ltd 
      (1963) RPC 61 at 71, namely: 
      
      
      
      “The judge ought not, in my opinion, attempt to read or construe the photograph himself; he looks at the photographs in determining which of the explanations given by the witnesses appears to be the most worthy of acceptance.” 
      
      
     [72]  
     The point made by Lord Reid is that photographs such as those relied on by the Council in the present case cannot on their own be used, as the Council seeks to use them, as a substitute for the evidence of witnesses or as a reason for rejecting the virtually unchallenged and consistent evidence of the appellant, Ms Coull and Ms Wilmington. As we have said above, they cannot be used to trump that evidence which compelled acceptance: see generally as to the use of photographic evidence,  
     Blacktown City Council v Hocking 
      per Spigelman CJ at [7] to [13]; and Tobias JA at [167] to [171].” 
    38. The defendant submitted that the Court of Appeal had failed to arrive at a decisive determination of its position in relation to the principles of law enunciated in Schmidt v Schmidt. However, the Court of Appeal in Blacktown City Council v Hocking considered the trial judge had erred by making considerations of fact about the conditions of a pit without the benefit of expert analysis, where expert evidence was essential to determine whether the pit had adequate support for its lid. The Court in Angel v Hawkesbury City Council did not express any views inconsistent with this. Neither court considered the issue of CCTV footage, which has the advantage of showing two-dimensional motion.39. The defendant further submits (at paragraph 14, written submissions) that the “more conservative view” as to the use to which photographic material should be put is that of Tobias JA in Hocking at [167]-[172] and in particular at [169]. It is submitted that it is noteworthy that Tobias JA, as well as Spigelman CJ, drew no distinction between the forms of photographic material and cited Beaton v McDivitt, a case which concerned videotape evidence, in support of this proposition of law.40. The defendant asserts that while a Court is entitled to use CCTV as an aid in explaining oral testimony, it is arguable whether the Court may well be able to use that evidence on its own, to base findings of an independent nature. 41. In my opinion, the defendant is making too much of what is only a passing reference by Tobias JA to a decision in which videotape evidence was used. Videotape and CCTV evidence occupy a special position because of their ability to capture, in an objective and independent way, evidence in a case. In “Disclosure of Evidentiary Video Tapes in Personal Injury Litigation” (2001) 75(6) ALJ 353, Mr Justice P W Young noted: 
     
     “It is common in litigation involving personal injury for the defendant to retain a camera person to videotape the plaintiff’s daily activities in an endeavour to establish that the plaintiff is exaggerating his or her symptoms.” 
    42. His Honour went on to note that in Boyes v Collins (2000) 23 WAR 123; [2000] WASCA 344 the Full Western Australian Supreme Court had ordered the defendant to produce the tape. Although the tape was protected by legal professional privilege, it was classed as “real evidence”, and because the overriding consideration is fairness, the videotape should be discovered so the witness had time to view it before giving evidence.43. The Court of Appeal has accepted videotape and CCTV evidence in many personal injury proceedings without any suggestion that its accuracy should be viewed with the caution application to photographs. In Presidential Security Services of Australia Pty Ltd v Brilley (2008) 67 ACSR 692; [2008] NSWCA 204 the Court of Appeal viewed and commented upon the CCTV of a shooting incident without the benefit of expert (or indeed any) interpretation. In Balasubramanian v Sara [1997] NSWCA 39 Mason P viewed the surveillance video and discussed his observations. CCTV and surveillance videos are routinely tendered in criminal proceedings.44. The objection to provenance in these proceedings was abandoned, and there has been no attack on the accuracy of the footage. Not only was the CCTV footage shot by the defendant, but the defendant asked the plaintiff to admit the provenance of the tape so that it would not be necessary to call persons involved in the CCTV footage preparation (Exhibit A). Despite this, the defendant challenged the lack of proof of provenance (a challenge later withdrawn) and asked the court to mark for identification the original of the footage in question and asserted the viewable copy was not the same. The footage, when provided to the plaintiff, had not been provided in a form that could be watched. Unfortunately, I am in the same position concerning this original footage and could not comment on any distortions in the original version even if they had been pointed out to me.45. In conclusion, such is the impact of CCTV and videotape evidence that it has resulted in the court making special provisions in the interest of fairness, including its production even when protected by privilege (Boyes v Collins). Where a party relied on surveillance tape at a hearing which had not been produced at an arbitration, that party was penalised as to costs: Morgan v Johnson (1998) 44 NSWLR 578. Production without prior warning may result in adjournment of the hearing (BHP Pty Co Ltd v Mason and Anor (Supreme Court of South Australia, Debelle J, 7 November 1996, unreported)).46. The rationale behind all of these decisions is, to quote the Full Supreme Court of Western Australia, the question of fairness. CCTV or surveillance video is strongly persuasive evidence, much more so than a photograph which may require expert interpretation, or may not adequately or fairly portray its subject.47. The circumstances in which courts should accept a challenge by a party to its own CCTV footage would have to be exceptional. I accordingly admitted it into evidence as Exhibit C.48. The availability of CCTV footage is an increasing feature of modern litigation. Courts need to be flexible in order to deal with modern technology, rather than to adopt pedantic or old-fashioned suspicions of modern inventions such as CCTV. In particular, any attempt for there to be a challenge of a generic nature to CCTV footage simply because it is CCTV footage, as opposed to some specifically identified flaw in the footage, is not only contrary to common sense, but also to the spirit of s 56 Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW).Conclusions concerning the circumstances of the plaintiff’s accident49. The plaintiff submits the train guard’s procedure is: 
     
     (a) the train stops; 
      
     (b) the guard opens to doors; 
      
     (c) the guard announces the next railway station; 
      
     (d) the guard keeps a proper lookout for passengers getting off and on; 
      
     (e) the guard announces the doors are closing, which the plaintiff asserts is a message that can only be heard within the train (although the open doors would, as the defendant pointed out and as the plaintiff conceded in her evidence, mean that persons like the plaintiff could and did hear it); 
      
     (f) the guard looks for passengers getting off and on; 
      
     (g) the guard blows his whistle loudly; 
      
     (h) the guard looks again; 
      
     (i) the guard pushes the door close button; 
      
     (j) the guard must again push the door closed button within 8 seconds, or he has to start the procedure again; and 
      
     (k) he must continuously keep his fingers on the door open button in case of an unexpected arrival or departure of a passenger. 
    50. I accept that the accident occurred the way Mr Clift and the CCTV footage demonstrated that it occurred. He had followed all these steps, including sounding the warning and blowing the whistle. The plaintiff knew, when she was coming down the stairs, that the train was already at the station and she had to both buy her ticket and arrive at the train doors before the train doors closed. The time that a train stands at a railway station platform is very short. The plaintiff knew that the warnings of the doors closing had already been sounded well before she attempted to get on the train. As one of the plaintiff’s legs was between the train and the platform and the other appears to have been trapped in the door, causing her to fall, she must have been attempting to enter the carriage when the doors were in fact closing.51. The description by the plaintiff of the circumstances of the accident is different to the version given to the medical practitioners she saw. The plaintiff’s counsel submits that the plaintiff is a woman who is unsophisticated, has never given evidence in court before and who has lived a substantial part of her life in a foreign culture. I accept that these are all factors which should be taken into account when considering the plaintiff’s evidence.52. However, I do not accept the plaintiff’s criticism of doctors as persons who are not professional statement takers. It is an important part of taking a medical history that the circumstances of the accident should be correctly taken down. In addition, several of the plaintiff’s doctors came from a similar kind of background to the plaintiff, and would be able to take into account, when taking down her history, relevant cultural and emotional factors.53. The inconsistencies in accounts to doctors are, however, of minor importance. The plaintiff’s description of having alerted the train guard to her wish to board, and their subsequent conversation in which he allegedly apologised for his negligence, are events which never occurred. The plaintiff’s written submissions do not refer to this evidence at all.54. I find that the accident occurred because the plaintiff attempted to board a train well after the guard had sounded the warning that the doors were about to close. The sole cause of the accident was that the plaintiff attempted to board the train when it was unsafe to do so. She knew the train was about to leave the station and that the doors were about to close. She had had no conversation with, and gave no warning to, the guard as alleged, and given the gross discrepancies between the plaintiff’s account of her conversations with Mr Clift and Mr Clift’s actual family situation, I discount entirely her assertions of having notified him that she was about to board the train.55. The plaintiff’s submissions assert (paragraph 1) that boarding and alighting a train are “one of the most dangerous acts that a person does in our society.” This is a submission that has been made about other means of ingress and egress, notably stairs (NSW Department of Housing v Hume [2007] NSWCA 69 at [93]). The law on this issue was recently, and exhaustively, analysed by the Court of Appeal in Transfield Services (Australia) v Hall [2008] NSWCA 294 at [58] – [107]. I gratefully borrow the careful analysis of the concept of “inherently dangerous” as set out in these judgments. The fact that mistakes in what the plaintiff calls “the departure process” (which I assume means attempting to board a train which is about to depart) can lead to serious injury or fatality is not sufficient, of itself, to place some non-delegable or higher duty on a defendant in circumstances where a passenger chooses to ignore warning noises and whistles and attempt to board a train which is about to depart.56. Accordingly, I find that there is no negligence and there will be a verdict for the defendant.57. In the even that I have erred in finding for the defendant, I will set out my findings in relation to the issue of contributory negligence and quantum.Contributory negligence and quantumContributory negligence58. The defendant submits (written submissions, paragraph 38) that the contributory negligence of the plaintiff is such that a holding of sole responsibility pursuant to s 5S Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) would not be inappropriate.59. The plaintiff submits that contributory negligence should be assessed at only 10% as “the plaintiff can cause very little damage to the train.” However, this is a subjective approach and the correct approach to take is an objective one: Joslyn v Berryman (2003) 214 CLR 552 at [16]. A plaintiff who hears the train warning of the doors about to close before she has even bought her ticket, and attempts to board after the warning whistle, is acting at great risk to herself on any objective view of the facts. 60. I do not accept the submission of the defendant that the conduct of the plaintiff is not such that she should be deprived of all damages. However, the plaintiff’s submission of a finding of 10% contributory negligence fails to have regard to the objective foolishness of the plaintiff’s conduct. 61. The plaintiff refers to Talbot-Butt v Holloway (1990) 12 MVR 70 as a comparable case on contributory negligence. The facts in that case were very different. The plaintiff, who was found by the court to have deliberately courted danger, ran in front of a car while inebriated. However, as the Court of Appeal explained in Mackenzie v Nominal Defendant [2005] NSWCA 180 at [104] ff, when discussing and distinguishing this case, inebriation may often not be grounds for reducing liability for contributory negligence; it will depend on the facts in the case. In the present case, the plaintiff was sober but extremely foolish, in that she did something at the last minute without warning. 62. A more appropriate proportion, having regard to the circumstances of the accident, would be 70%. This was not a case where the plaintiff had no option other than to catch this train. She could just have easily have waited for the next train to come along.Damages63. The plaintiff, in the Statement of Claim particularises the following injuries: 
     
     “1. Partial articular surface tear of supraspinatus. 
      
     2. Post traumatic rotator cuff arthropathy to left shoulder with impingement. 
      
     3. Post traumatic mechanical derangement of the cervical spine. 
      
     4. Further post traumatic mechanical derangement of the lumbar spine.” 
    64. The plaintiff complains of the following disabilities: 
     
     “1. Pain, discomfort and restriction of movement of left shoulder and arm. 
      
     2. Pain, discomfort and restriction of movement of neck. 
      
     3. Pain, discomfort and restriction of movement of the lower back.  
      
     4. Pain to right lower limb. 
      
     5. Pain to left lower limb. 
      
     6. Restriction in ability to bend, lift or carry. 
      
     7. Restriction in ability to lift the left arm above head height. 
      
     8. Sleep disturbance.” 
    65. However, the Plaintiff has a complex medical history. In addition to health problems unrelated to accidents, such as carpal tunnel, she has suffered from the following accidents: 
     
     (a) In 1982 she had a fall while on a train. She recovered $10,000 compensation. 
      
     (b) The plaintiff fell and injured her lower back in about 1984 (MAS Report). The defendant accepts that this is probably the same accident as the 1982 accident and I have proceeded on this basis. 
      
     (c) The plaintiff told Dr Guirgis she had a fall in a shopping centre in 1987 (see Dr Guirgis’ report in Exhibit F). 
      
     (d) The plaintiff told Dr Ciardi she fell down stairs in a train station on about 16 September 1998 (Plaza MC). 
      
     (e) The plaintiff tells her GP she fell at the Canterbury bus stop in July 2000 and hurt her right knee (Plaza MC). 
      
     (f) In May 2001 she told Dr Ciardi she fell in the train at Bankstown and had left shoulder pain (Plaza MC). 
      
     (g) The plaintiff had an accident in the bathroom of Granville Railway Station in May (or August) 2006 (MAS). 
      
     (h) The plaintiff had the accident the subject of these proceedings on 27 October 2006. 
    66. The plaintiff in examination in chief referred to the incidents in (a), (d), (g) and (h). 67. The defendant raises the following issues in relation to damages: 
     
     (a) The lack of contemporaneous complaint concerning the accident. This is in part because the reports of the plaintiff’s doctor were given to the plaintiff when he retired and she told the Court they were at her home. Although there was an opportunity for her to bring them to Court the next day, she did not do so. Accordingly, there is no documentation available to confirm precisely what was said to the plaintiff’s treating doctor.  
      
     (b) Inadequacy concerning contemporaneous records – those contemporaneous reports that do exist, namely Exhibit 3, the Complaint Report to the defendant concerning the accident, refers only to her right hip and lower leg. 
      
     (c) There is a long and significant medical history, including problems with the same areas of the plaintiff’s body and the plaintiff was in fact on a disability pension in relation to these and other problems. 
      
     (d) An assertion that the plaintiff, in describing her injuries and disabilities was exaggerating. 
    68. As the obligation lies on the defendant to unravel the skein of causation, I shall deal with these issues in some detail.No reports from Dr Chan69. The plaintiff, in her evidence in chief, said she saw Dr Chan the day after the accident. Exhibit D shows that the plaintiff in fact visited him the following Monday. However, as Dr Chan’s medical records are not in evidence, their contents are unknown.70. The plaintiff did tell Dr Lawson that when she saw Dr Chan in relation to the accident he referred her for X-rays and ultrasound of her left shoulder. (It should be noted that the plaintiff’s apparent injury was to her right hip and leg, according to the contemporaneous report she made). Dr Chan did in fact refer her but not until December 2006 (Exhibit F – Dr Robertson) so this cannot have been as a result of any information provided to Dr Chan when she saw him the Monday following the accident.71. A further problem is that Dr Chan was treating the plaintiff at this time for the fall in the bathroom on Granville Railway Station, which occurred in or about either May or August 2006 (the latter date is the most probable, as it is the date that the plaintiff gave to Dr Guirgis – see his report of 5 March 2007). This caused an injury to the plaintiff’s right hand, and is not the subject of any claim in these proceedings, but it also caused a lumbosacral injury.72. The reason for the plaintiff having treatment and investigation of her left shoulder problem in December 2006 cannot be corroborated by regard to Dr Chan’s medical records because they are not available. Dr Chan’s medical records would have shed light on whether this was some fresh injury, a continuation of the injury that the plaintiff had from earlier treatment, such as the Granville fall, or as a result of the accident the plaintiff had at Pendle Hill Railway Station which is the subject of these proceedings.73. Further, both Dr Maxwell and Dr Johnson comment on the difficulty of diagnosis of this condition on ultrasound. The defendant, in written submissions (paragraph 54) draws my attention to this, to the variation in the plaintiff’s complaints as to the causation of the pain (either by way of referral from the neck or by reason of direct injury) and that the complaint of injury to the left shoulder was raised well after the accident.74. The defendant asks me to draw a Jones v Dunkel (1959) 101 CLR 298 inference arising from the failure to produce the records of Dr Chan. 75. The inference for which Jones v Dunkel stands is generally applied to the failure of a party to call a witness. In White v White [2004] NSWSC 208, Macready M (as his Honour then was) considered that a failure to comply with obligations to disclose financial information in de facto property settlement application could be a matter in which it was appropriate to apply Jones v Dunkel to draw inferences against the party who had failed to provide the appropriate information. This decision is referred to in Hayes v Marquis [2008] NSWCA 10 at paragraph 130 but was distinguished on the facts of the case.76. Non–production of documents in a party’s possession is often dealt with in accordance with the principles of Allen v Tobias (1958) 98 CLR 367 at 375. While this relates to the destruction of a document, the highly unusual circumstances of a plaintiff who has medical records in her own possession and does not produce them, despite her solicitors being aware that these documents have been subpoenaed by the defendant, must come very close to a situation falling within the parameters of the principles of Allen v Tobias.77. If that is the case, then the presumption to draw would not be the inference for which Jones v Dunkel stands, but the stronger presumption in Allen v Tobias, namely that “the strongest possible presumption arises that if it had been produced it would have told against him” because the person who fails to produce the document is “in the position that he is without the corroboration which might have been expected in his case”.78. The principles in Allen v Tobias were considered by the Court of Appeal in Dem Compagnie Pty Ltd v Telxon Australia [2004] NSWCA 66 at paragraphs [24]ff. The circumstances in that case were that the relevant document was not produced and since its non-production was not explained, the inference was that it had been deliberately destroyed (at [25]). Although a witness who could have given evidence about this document was not called, and his absence attracted the principles in Jones v Dunkel (at [25]), in other words, the Court of Appeal differentiated between a witness who was not called and a document, which was not produced.79. In Clark v New South Wales [2006] NSWSC 673 at [76]ff, Johnson J gives an exhaustive analysis of the circumstances in which unfavourable inferences will be drawn where destruction of potential evidence has occurred or can be inferred. His Honour noted the need for there to be an element of conscious repression or withholding before such an inference could be drawn (Bridges v Pelley [2001] NSWCA 31 at [52]) and that the fabrication “or suppression” of evidence (Marsden v Amalgamated Television Services Pty Ltd [2001] NSWSC 510 at [40]) could give rise to the inference not only to any specific fact in the cause but to operate, indefinitely though strongly, against the whole mass of alleged facts constituting the relevant parties’ cause of action.80. It is most unusual for a doctor to provide his notes to a patient as opposed to another doctor. It appears that this occurred because Dr Chan was retiring. The evidence of the plaintiff’s treating doctor was most important in this case, not less because Dr Chan, who had retired, was not in any position to give a report concerning the plaintiff’s condition or the treatment he prescribed.81. Accordingly, I consider it is appropriate that I draw the inference in Allen v Tobias in relation to the non-production of the medical records of Dr Chan which the plaintiff said were given to her and were in her home.The causation problem82. The plaintiff, both in her evidence to the Court in chief and in her description of her medical history to medical practitioners, was unwilling to admit to the existence of a long past history of health problems. Not only did she seek to minimise the impact of her prior back complaints, but she asserted that she was awarded a disability pension by reason of her carpal tunnel problem. This is incorrect. The plaintiff’s bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome was diagnosed in May 2000 but by this stage she had been on a disability pension for some years.83. The plaintiff’s medical problems were compounded by her refusal to accept medical advice for treatment. Two of these are of relevance. The plaintiff suffered back pain from abdominal and pelvic adhesions and chronic pelvic inflammatory disease. It was recommended that the plaintiff have surgery for this condition, which she refused (Exhibit 1, Tab 6). The defendant submits that part of her back pain is that she continues to have these problems. In addition, after the plaintiff was diagnosed with bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome, she was advised that her condition was sufficiently severe for surgery to be recommended. Again, the plaintiff refused to have this surgery. The problems caused by the carpal tunnel involved the forearms to the level on both sides, weakness of the right hand and pain sufficient to wake the plaintiff from sleep, a common side effect from carpal tunnel. The plaintiff was suffering pain in the neck and shoulder at about this time, which would have compounded other medical problems.84. Further, in May 2001 the plaintiff’s medical problems were added to when she suffered either tendonitis or tendonosis and an intrasubstance tear in her left shoulder muscles. The plaintiff was still suffering from pain six months later (Exhibit 1, Tab 7). The notes from Dr Ciardi’s practice are very incomplete and it is difficult to know how long this condition went on for.85. In addition, the plaintiff’s significant lower back problems were such that it was recommended that she should be reviewed by an orthopaedic surgeon, according to a treating doctor’s report of 8 May 2003 (Exhibit 1, Tab 13). There is no information as to whether or not this occurred, but it would appear likely that the plaintiff did not have this review.86. I am satisfied that the defendant has established that prior to the accident, the plaintiff’s state of health was significantly a problem for her and also that she was receiving assistance in her home in relation to her carpal tunnel problems. Accordingly to Dr Ciardi’s report of 17 November 1998, the plaintiff at this time, in addition to her pelvic problems, had an arthritic lumbar spine, a bulging L4/5 disc (which prevented her from working even 8 hours a week) and lower back problems manifesting in pain radiating into the legs.87. However, the fact that the plaintiff had pre-existing problems would not, if she suffered a genuine injury, which aggravated them, prevent her from claiming in relation to the impact of the accident upon her injuries. 88. I now turn to a consideration of whether or not the plaintiff has exaggerated the injuries that she suffered from her fall at the railway station.The plaintiff’s credit as a witness89. The plaintiff has the following problems with credibility: 
     
     (a) Her account of the accident is unreliable and inconsistent with both the CCTV footage and the objective facts concerning her claims about her conversation with Mr Clift about his use of the mobile phone to call his wife about a new baby. 
      
      
     (b) The plaintiff has given inconsistent accounts of the accident to doctors and to the Court. The inconsistency in her accounts to the doctors is comparatively minor, but the whole of her evidence about waving to and having conversations with the train guard before she got on the train (including his alleged apology after the accident, his use of the mobile phone and the story that his wife had just had a baby) is a fiction. 
      
      
     (c) The plaintiff has failed to produce treating doctors’ records, including the records of her first visit to him following the accident, and the inferences to be drawn from such failure can be applied, as Levine J noted in  
     Marsden 
     , not only to the facts in question but to other issues in the case. 
      
      
     (d) The plaintiff made some clearly wrong and, I find, untruthful statements to the Court, such as her claim that her disability pension related to her carpal tunnel syndrome. The plaintiff must have been aware that she was already on a disability pension for several years prior her carpal tunnel diagnosis. 
    90. The plaintiff’s evidence on a number of issues was (as the plaintiff’s counsel concedes in his submissions) dramatic and colourful, such as her description of screaming passengers rushing to stop the train, and this included her description of her problems doing housework in the home. While I take into account the plaintiff’s lack of experience with courts and her cultural background, this does not wholly absolve the plaintiff from her obligation to give a careful and accurate account of her injury and subsequent disabilities.91. In addition, the two persons who are asserted to have provided her with assistance since the accident, namely her sister and next-door neighbour, were not available to give evidence to the Court. While I draw no inference from their failure to give evidence, as their absence was explained by reason of health problems, the fact remains that the plaintiff is deprived of the availability of corroborative evidence in circumstances where her credit is such that I would be reluctant to accept her evidence without corroboration.92. The plaintiff did call her brother to give evidence. However, it would appear that this assistance with the housework was of a comparatively minor nature and he himself suffers from ill health. His evidence was of little assistance. In particular, the times given for performance of some household tasks, and the number of times they were performed during the week, were such as to point to either an inordinate degree of fastidiousness, which is unreasonable, or to exaggeration by both the plaintiff and her brother.93. I accept the defendant’s submission that the plaintiff has exaggerated her pain and injury resulting from the fall at the railway station and also that she has attributed pre-existing pain to the accident. As the defendant’s medical expert has set out in the report, the likelihood is that the plaintiff suffered a soft tissue injury which has resolved in a matter of weeks and accordingly, any injury she suffered as a result of her fall at the railway station was of short duration and she has now recovered.94. Having considered these disputed issues in relation to quantum, I now turn to the specifics of the damages claim.95. Damages recoverable by the plaintiff are regulated by Chapter 5, Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (NSW) and s 121 Transport Administration Act 1988 (NSW).96. The plaintiff has been assessed by the MAS Assessor and has been found not to exceed 10% permanent impairment. Thus non-economic loss is not recoverable.Past and future out of pocket expenses97. Past and future out-of-pocket expenses have been particularised. The difficulty is that the plaintiff has claimed for a large number of medical attendances on Dr Chan, Dr Guirgis and others in circumstances where it is not clear that these relate to the injuries. However, these past expenses have been agreed in quantum only at $4,516.50 so I do not need to determine this issue further. If the plaintiff is successful, she should be awarded this sum. 98. The plaintiff claims a modest sum for future out-of-pockets, namely the cost of four visits to the doctor and analgesia at the rate of $7 per week, for 20 years (666.4 at 5%) which is $7,597.99. As to future medical expenses, I am satisfied the plaintiff has entirely recovered and she is not entitled to any future medical expenses. I accept the defendant’s submissions in this regard.100. The past domestic assistance claim is only particularised in the most general fashion. Not only was the plaintiff’s description of what she did very general, but the description given by her brother in his evidence was of little assistance. The comments in the medical reports by doctors such as Dr Maxwell and Dr Johnson suffer from the handicap that the plaintiff did not give them a full report as to the extent of her pre-existing health problems and it is difficult to determine exactly what additional assistance the plaintiff required following the accident as opposed to before the accident.Past and future domestic assistance101. On 12 November 2008 the Civil Liability Legislation Amendment Act 2008 (NSW) commenced operation: Government Gazette No. 145, 12 November 2008. This legislation is retrospective in relation to undecided claims (see Schedule 1) and designed to close the loophole exposed in s 15 Civil Liability Act 2002 exposed in Harrison v Melhem [2008] NSWCA 67. Like amendments are made to the Motor Accidents Act 1988 (NSW) and to the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 by Schedule 2 of the Civil Liability Legislation Amendment Act.102. I am not satisfied, in relation to past domestic assistance, that the plaintiff is able to overcome any of the thresholds in s 128(3) Motor Accidents Compensation Act. 103. As to future domestic assistance, since I accept the contention of the defendant that the plaintiff has entirely recovered from any injury she suffered from her fall, I consider she is not entitled to any future domestic assistance. I note the submissions of the defendant in paragraph 67 of the written submissions, that the threshold under s 128(3) Motor Accidents Compensation Act cannot be met but as I am satisfied the plaintiff has no need for future domestic assistance by reason of any injury she suffered in her fall, I do not need to determine this issue.104. Accordingly, the only head of damage for which the plaintiff could recover is the agreed sum for past out-of-pocket expenses referred to above.Case management issues105. This matter was listed before me as a one day plus hearing. It only finished in two days because two of the plaintiff’s witnesses were unavailable and the defendant elected not to call a witness when it became apparent that would take the case into a third day. The matter had to be adjourned so that written submissions could be provided and when there was non-compliance by the plaintiff a further date had to be set. An additional complicating factor was that the plaintiff did not provide a chronology; I am indebted to counsel for the defendant for giving me a copy of his own chronology.106. While case length may vary according to a number of factors, including the approach taken by the judge hearing the case, any case where there are three or four witnesses for both parties, issues of liability and causation and legal argument about issues such as the admissibility of CCTV is unlikely to be disposed of in a one day plus hearing. 107. The practical result was that not only was the case adjourned twice but the adjourned matter had to be relisted outside usual court hours both times, and it was not possible for an ex tempore judgment to be handed down. In a case where there is no transcript and delay resulting the possibility of error in a reserve judgment is greater.108. Counsel in this matter did their best to finish the case in two days, and I am grateful for their assistance to me, which was necessary to provide “just, cheap and quick” resolution of litigation in accordance with s 56 Civil Procedure Act in this very busy Court. Orders(1) Judgment for the defendant.(2) Plaintiff pay defendant’s costs.(3) Liberty to apply, such liberty to be exercised within three months of the date of judgment.(4) Exhibits retained for 28 days.

      JUDGMENT - Applications to discharge jury 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: There is before the Court a series of applications to discharge the jury.  
     
      
    2 On 31 October 2008 five men were indicted before me on a charge of conspiring to do acts in preparation for a terrorist act or acts. The same men, together with four others, had been indicted before me in mid 2007. Pre-trial proceedings in relation to the original indictment have proceeded before me at Sydney West Trial Courts in the period between the end of February and 31 October 2008. 
     
      
    3 For reasons that are not necessary to explain in this decision, the indictment presented on 31 October, as I have said, related to five only of the original accused. The remaining men are, however, alleged to be co-conspirators with the five accused and their names are set out and identified in the October indictment. 
     
      
    4 The position has now been reached where the trial is, for practical purposes, nearing the end of its fourth week. It is said to be a trial that is likely to last for approximately nine months. 
     
      
    5 The jury empanelment process was a lengthy one, taking a week in all. As might be expected, it was not an easy matter to find a body of jury panel members who were willing, able and prepared to sit on a lengthy criminal trial lasting nine months or more. Five thousand jury panel members were summonsed and the ultimate pool of panel members representing those who were willing and able to serve was approximately 240 persons. A jury of fifteen was selected. It has been the Court's overall impression that these fifteen jury members are diligent, attentive and highly conscious of their duties as members of a criminal jury. 
     
      
       
      A note is received 
       
      
    6 Shortly before 10am on 26 November 2008, I received a note from the jury. It is apparent that it has been written by the foreperson, although the last two sentences indicate that these are the words of one individual juror concerning a particular incident. The note reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “On Thursday 19th November 4 jurors were followed to our car park (Parramatta Stadium). All 4 didn't enter our cars & waited until those people went to their cars (but we didn't see them enter or drive away).  
        
       
      
      
       
        
        On Tuesday 25th November, 1 juror as she was turning out from the car park noticed that the same person from the week before was standing behind her car & pulled out a note pad from her handbag & wrote something down & then pulled out her phone & made a call.  
        
       
       
        
        I am not normal paranoid, but this did cause me to park in a different location & this has caused the other jurors some concern.  
        
       
       
        
        The lady has a head scarf & is located in the public gallery.” 
        
       
      
    7 It appears, plainly enough, that the person identified by the juror as being involved in the second incident, and probably involved in the first, is a young woman who, dressed in traditional Islamic garb, has been present in Court on a number of days during the trial. I have been told by Mr Ozen junior counsel for Mr Elomar, (although this is not known to the jury), that the young woman in question is the niece of Mr Elomar. Mr Ozen has also told me (although this is also apparently unknown to the jury) that on occasions his solicitor has made inquiries of that person in the courtroom while the trial has been underway. Mr Ozen said this has happened on more than one occasion in the last two and a half weeks or so. 
     
      
    8 I would simply observe that, as trial Judge, I do my best to keep an eye on what is happening in the courtroom and around the courtroom. I have noticed the young woman in Court myself, but, for my part, I certainly have not noticed those inquiries taking place. I accept what Mr Ozen says, of course, but I do not think it has been particularly apparent. Certainly, it has not been apparent to me, and there is nothing in the jury’s note that indicates, that it was apparent to them. Indeed, the form of the note really suggests that the identification has simply been of a person observed in the public gallery. 
     
      
    9 Upon receiving the jury note, I arranged for counsel to see me in private Chambers. This was an unusual course to take, but I did it on the basis that the young woman in question might have been present in Court at 10 o'clock yesterday. It seemed preferable that I should draw the attention of counsel to the note in private Chambers before proceeding to Court. Proceedings in chambers were attended by our Court Reporters and the content of the brief meeting was transcribed and forms part of the trial transcript. 
     
      
    10 In open Court I marked the jury note as MFI 61. I recorded the fact of the meeting in private Chambers and I was informed, as was in any event apparent, that the young woman in question was not in Court on that day. I indicated that I had come to the decision that I should ask the events referred to in the note be brought to the attention of the police, so that inquiries could be made about the matter. It was my view that the police were in a better position than I was to investigate the matter that had arisen and that, in all the circumstances, the matter should be followed up in that way. 
     
      
    11 After consulting counsel as to the appropriate procedure to adopt, I determined that I would bring the jury into Court and give them a direction that immediately addressed the issues raised in the note. A number of counsel indicated that they wished to get instructions as to whether to seek a discharge of the jury, although Mr Button of Senior Counsel for Moustafa Cheikho indicated that he had such instructions at the time and was ready to make an application for a discharge whenever it was convenient to the Court. There was no opposition to my suggestion that the jury should receive an immediate direction concerning the incidents in the note, MFI 61. 
     
      
    12 When the jury returned to Court, I gave them a direction in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        HIS HONOUR: 
         Thank you, members of the jury, for the note you have sent me. As you would well appreciate, the subject matter of the note is clearly a matter of concern to the Court. You may be assured the Court takes the issue very seriously.  
        
       
      
      
       
        
        What I want to do is this: I am going to refer the incident to the police for investigation and ask that a report be given to them. It may be that there is an entirely innocent explanation for the incident. I don't know. Just like you, I try to keep an open mind on all these things and that is the important thing to do. That might take a few days to examine.  
        
       
       
        
        But, more importantly, I want to say to you that while it appears that, at least at face value, that the incident had something to do with the person who has been in court in the public gallery, there is not the slightest suggestion that this incident has anything to do with the accused at all. There is not the slightest suggestion that the incident has been prompted by the accused, has been suggested by the accused, has been encouraged by the accused. There is not the slightest suggestion that it has anything to do with the accused at all.  
        
       
       
        
        If I may pick an analogy, you know yourselves if you read in the paper that sometimes supporters of a club will misbehave at a match, and it is a sad thing when that happens, but it often has nothing to do with the club or the players. They have not sought it to be done or encouraged it. So here what I say to you, and I want to stress it as much as I possibly can, it has nothing to do with the accused, and you should not draw any inference against the accused at all because of the occurrence of this incident.  
        
       
       
        
        Your duty is to judge this trial impartially and on the evidence you hear in this court. I have said that to you a number of times, and I cannot stress too highly how important that is. So that when an incident of this kind happens, you have to put it out of your mind and you have to say to yourself: ""I will judge this case on the evidence I hear in court and nothing else.""  
        
       
       
        
        These are not just empty words. They are words that you should deeply reflect upon, and I trust that all of you, having taken an oath or affirmation to decide this case according to the evidence will do just that. You should not allow this to be a distraction to you. It will be investigated, the Court will take care of it, and you should put it out of your mind and simply concentrate on the evidence that is brought before you.  
        
       
       
        
        Of course, if anything of a similar kind were to happen again, you should report it to me immediately. A prompt report would mean that I can take prompt steps. I trust that nothing of this kind will happen again, but if it does, please let me know and please do not hesitate to let me know.  
        
       
       
        
        There are a number of practical steps I want to put in place today, and I think that they may take me a little while. There will be some further matters I have to deal with counsel arising out of the incident, and I think in all those circumstances, rather than keep you hanging around today, I will ask you to disperse for the day and to come back at 10 o'clock tomorrow morning. I am sorry that you lost a day. It was the last thing I wanted to happen, but these things happen, as I say, and we must take them in our stride.  
        
       
       
        
        The important thing I want to stress to you is that this incident has nothing to do with the accused and you should not draw any inference adverse to these men arising from this incident, and you can be assured that I will have a look at the issue, about car parking, or where you park, and how you get here, and see from a practical point of view if I can protect you from any similar sort of incident happening again. I will be attending to that during the course of today and reporting back to you tomorrow. Thank you, see you tomorrow.” 
        
       
      
    13 Following the retirement of the jury for the day, I gave counsel the opportunity to obtain instructions and prepare their applications. The Court resumed at 12.30pm and applications were then made on behalf of all of the accused for a discharge of the jury. 
     
      
    14 The principal submission was made by Mr Button of Senior Counsel. There was support for his submissions from other counsel, but it is fair to say that Mr Button's submissions were adopted by all. Mr Button emphasised a number of factual aspects of the situation. These may be briefly described as follows: 
     
      
       
      (1) The temporal sequence of the ""incidents"" indicated that the ""problem"" had existed for about a week. It was not something that had just happened yesterday. 
       
       
      (2) Mr Button noted that the first incident was expressed in emphatic terms. By this counsel conveyed that the jurors did not merely suspect that they were being followed, but said that they were in fact followed to the car park at Parramatta Stadium. 
       
       
      (3) Mr Button correctly noted that the concern was not merely that of one juror. There were four involved in the first incident. Moreover, the second incident was said to have caused ""the other jurors"" some concern. I took this to mean that Mr Button’s proposition was that really all the jurors were concerned, not just one, and not just four. 
       
       
      (4) Mr Button referred to evidence given yesterday, suggesting that apparently Mr Baladjam had followed a practice of noting down car registration numbers. Senior Counsel suggested that the second incident might be strongly identified with that type of evidence. I would merely comment that this was, however, very bland evidence in its context, that is, the evidence relating to Mr Baladjam. I do not consider that it would have impacted on the jury in the manner suggested. 
       
       
      (5) The person in question had been in Court on a number of occasions and always dressed in Islamic garb. This, of itself, would suggest an association with the accused, who are all devout Muslims. Mr Ozen's information about his instructing solicitor having consulted with that person in the courtroom on more than one occasion would, according to the submission, make an association between that person and the accused ""virtually inevitable"" in the mind of the jury. 
       
       
      (6) Mr Button stressed the contextual aspects of the factual appreciation of the incidents. These were the indictment itself and the evidence in support of the indictment; the possession by some of the accused and a co-conspirator of loaded firearms at the time of arrest, and finally, that the conspiracy is alleged to have involved four other men, not in the dock. This last matter was a reference by Mr Button to the proposition that, for all the jury knows, these four persons may not be in custody. They may be at large. They may be free to threaten or take retribution against members of the jury. 
       
       
      (7) Finally, there was a repeat of the contextual aspect arising from the concept that Mr Button described as Islamic prejudice. The combination of these four contextual matters was the overall proposition that the jury was likely to be experiencing discomfort, prejudice and fear. 
       
      
    15 Mr Button next referred to the legal principles applicable to the present application to discharge the jury. Those principles are well known and there was no dispute at the Bar table as to the extent and application of those principles. 
     
      
    16 I took Mr Button’s proposition to be similar to that advocated by Ms Yehia, Mr Scragg and Mr Waterstreet namely that their clients would be likely to be linked with the woman’s apparent and possible efforts to intimidate or influence jury members. 
     
      
    17 Indeed, as I have said, other counsel adopted Mr Button's submissions and added other considerations. There was a concern expressed that a part of the direction I gave may have inadvertently compounded ""the problem"". This was a reference in the direction I gave where there was a mention by me of sending the matter to the police for investigation, and asking that a report be given to me by the police. 
     
      
    18 Mr Waterstreet suggested that this might lead to an inevitable tension, suggesting the jury had been tainted, not only by their own apprehensions at what might be innocent behaviour, but where such tainting could not be cured. 
     
      
    19 Surprisingly, the Crown indicated, later in the afternoon, that it had received instructions from the Director of Public Prosecutions, that he was prepared to offer no objection to the application for discharge.  
     
      
    20 I do not intend to be critical of the Director of Public Prosecutions, but I regard the Crown's position as somewhat of a surprising one. This was because the Crown eschewed any suggestion that the circumstances of the incidents called for a discharge of the jury. Notably, the Crown did not embrace the defence submission that the directions which I had given were inadequate to address the issue. Indeed, the only basis on which the Director of Public Prosecutions instructed his legal representatives to indicate that he did not oppose the application related to his concern that an appellate court might possibly take an adverse view about a decision not to discharge the jury.  
     
      
    21 In that possible circumstance, the fact that the trial was only in its fourth week persuaded the Director, apparently, that he should not, in such circumstances, oppose the applications. It may be convenient if I set out those parts of the transcript where the Crown made its position clear: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: 
         Your Honour, thank you for the time that your Honour has permitted us. Your Honour, our position is that, having regard to the stage of the trial some four weeks, essentially, into a trial which is scheduled to last for at least six months, we have reluctantly come to the conclusion that we should not oppose this application, having regard to what might be called the appellate risks in the facts that have been presented to the court thus far. If the matter had been further down the track, if I can put it that way, we might have taken a different view, and sought to persuade your Honour that directions were an appropriate way of dealing with the matter.  
        
       
      
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: 
         Your only concern is your position as a possible unsuccessful respondent to an appeal, is it?  
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: 
         Your Honour, that is our concern. There is an appreciable risk that an appellate court might take the view about the matter, if it was to proceed, that would result in the expenditure of a good deal of public money, from both ends of the bar table, inherent in the prospects of a retrial. And as I say, it is the stage of the trial we are at that has persuaded us that we should not in those circumstances oppose the applications.  
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: 
         That is the only basis on which you take that position?  
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: 
         Yes, that is the basis on which we take that position, your Honour.” 
        
       
       
      The principles to be applied 
       
      
    22 I turn now to consider the principles to be applied. As I have said, there is no dispute about the principles to be applied. They derive essentially from the remarks of the High Court in Webb v R (1994) 122 ALR 41. In that case, the appellants Webb and Hay had been charged with murder of one Patrick. On the second day of the Judge's summing-up, and after the evidence had closed, a juror brought some daffodils into Court and gave them to a person to give to the deceased's mother. The trial Judge was asked to discharge the jury and refused to do so. A majority of the High Court upheld the trial Judge's decision. In the course of the judgment of Mason CJ and McHugh J, their Honours stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “The learned trial Judge held that he had a discretion to discharge the jury if he believed that 'there was a real danger that the position of the accused had been, or might have been, prejudiced' by the conduct of the juror in arranging for flowers to be given to the deceased's mother. The learned Judge relied on English authority in formulating the 'real danger' test. However, we are of opinion that this was too stringent a test. In our opinion, the test that his Honour should have applied was whether, despite the warning that he proposed to give to the jury, the circumstances of the incident would still give a fair-minded and informed observer a reasonable apprehension of a lack of impartiality on the part of the juror.” 
        
       
      
    23 A decision to like effect was given by the other majority justice, Toohey J, at 75. 
     
      
    24 In R v Wood (2008) NSWSC 817, Barr J, in determining to discharge a jury, applied the Webb test in the following paragraphs: 
     
      
       
        
        “(31) The exercise of a trial judge's discretion to discharge a jury when some incident occurs during a trial which may adversely affect its fairness depends upon the principle of necessity stated in  
        Winsor v R 
         (1866) LR 1 QB 390. There must be evident 'a high degree of need for such discharge...such as in the wider sense of the word might be denoted by necessity'. Per Earl CJ at 394. This principle was adopted by the Victorian Supreme Court in  
        R v Boland 
         (1974) VR 849 at 866-867; the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        R v George, Harris and Hilton 
         (1987) 9 NSWLR 527 at 533; and the High Court in  
        Crofts v R 
         (1996) 186 CLR 427. 
        
       
       
        
        (32) The test to be applied for determining whether any irregular incidents involving a juror warrants the discharge of the juror or the jury as a whole is whether or not the incident is such that, notwithstanding any proposed direction of the trial Judge, it gives rise to a reasonable apprehension or suspicion on the part of a fair-minded and informed member of the public that a juror or jury will not discharge its tasks impartially ( 
        Webb and Hay v R 
        ). 
        
       
       
        
        (33) One of the overriding factors to keep in mind is that the appearance as well as the facts of impartiality is necessary to retain confidence in the administration of justice. Both the parties to the case and the general public must be satisfied that justice has not only been done but that it has been seen to be done ( 
        Webb and Hay v R 
         at 50). 
        
       
      
      
       
        
        (34) The High Court in  
        Crofts v R 
         held that no rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on application to discharge a jury, however, factors to be considered include the seriousness of the incident in the context of the contested issues; the stage at which the incident occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome any apprehended impact. Much leeway must be allowed to the trial Judge to evaluate these and other considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial.” 
        
       
      
    25 In William Edward Pearson [2000] 114 A Crim R 80, the Court of Criminal Appeal emphasised that the test to be applied is an objective one. 
     
      
       
      Resolution of the issues 
       
      
    26 I have given careful consideration to the submissions made by counsel for the defence. I accept that the trial is only in its fourth week and we have many months to go before the trial concludes. On the other hand, I do not accept that there is the slightest suggestion that either of the incidents referred to in the note has been prompted, initiated, supported or encouraged by the accused. That seems to me to be a highly important matter for consideration in the present applications for discharge. The direction I have given to the jury emphasises that this is the situation and tells them, in plain terms, that the incident, if I may describe both events in that way, had nothing to do with the accused. I have told the jury, in plain terms, that they should not draw any inference adverse to the accused arising from the matters of concern in their note. 
     
      
    27 I have watched this jury carefully since its empanelment. I have particularly observed that they are very heedful and attentive to any direction I have given them. They readily indicate from their body language and response that they are mindful of the need to respect the directions of the Court. In particular, when I gave the direction to the jury yesterday, I watched the members of the jury very carefully and I am satisfied that they understood and intended to comply with that direction. There was not the slightest indication that any jury member felt unable, as a consequence of the incidents, to act impartially in this trial. 
     
      
    28 To confirm my observations and impressions, or to disabuse them, I asked the jury this morning, before finally determining the issue, whether each member of the jury could assure the Court that, notwithstanding the events mentioned in the note, MFI 61, each juror was able to discharge his or her task as a juror in this trial impartially. The response was in the affirmative. 
     
      
    29 Mr Button of Senior Counsel, Ms Yehia, Mr Waterstreet and Mr Scragg have all addressed me about the question and answer given to me this morning. Mr Button has argued that there is no, or limited, value in the answer. Mr Button submitted that it would have been embarrassing for a juror to say “I cannot be impartial”. It would have required him or her, perhaps, to “break ranks”. In those circumstances, Senior Counsel argued that there was little value in the juror’s response. 
     
      
    30 Secondly, Mr Button argued that, even if each juror thought individually that he or she was perfectly able to heed my direction yesterday, able to give impartial consideration to the issues in this trial, and able to put to one side altogether the behaviour of the young woman, there might be lurking beneath the surface some form of unrecognised prejudice or bias. This would be so, senior counsel argued, even if the jury were able to act on the basis that, what ever the true nature of her actions, there was no culpable connection between the woman and the accused. 
     
      
    31 I consider that the question that was asked of the jurors this morning was quite clear. I think it required each of them to focus on the question as an individual and to answer, through the foreman, as an individual. If there were any individual among them who felt he or she could not act impartially in the trial, I would have expected that the note would have been expressed in terms to indicate that situation. Moreover, I think that one is entitled to take the response contained in the note at its face value and, in my view, it has considerable value. 
     
      
    32 As I have said, I have endeavoured to take into account all of the matters placed before me by counsel in their careful arguments. I accept that there is an association between the young Muslim woman in Court and Mr Elomar. The extent of that association arising from her blood relationship to him is not known to the jury. I doubt very much whether the jury will have noticed at all that on more than one occasion Mr Elomar's solicitor has spoken to this woman.  
     
      
    33 But I accept that it would be clear to the jury that she is here as a supporter, in some way or other, of the accused men, or at least one of them. This is a matter to be taken into account, but the important point is that there is no suggestion that she has been ""put up"" to the incidents by Mr Elomar or any of the other accused. My direction to the jury reinforces that that is so.  
     
      
    34 I have also taken into account Mr Waterstreet's submission. But, for my part, I do not consider that there is any problem in informing the jury that the police are required to examine the matter. That is all they have been told and that is all they need to know at this stage. Indeed, I took the view that the jury needs to be reassured that the incident would be examined, particularly to ensure that it, or some other incident of that kind, does not happen again. 
     
      
    35 I will, however, take an additional step, not indicated yesterday, in that I will ask the Crown to provide the material, that is the note and a copy of that transcript, to the Registrar of the Court, with a request that the Registrar contact the police to look into the matter. I think that that is more appropriate than to involve the Crown directly in any police examination, inquiry or investigation. 
     
      
    36 As I see it, there is no need for such an inquiry to involve individual members of the jury at this stage. It may require such a situation at a later stage, perhaps after the trial has concluded. But I have no doubt that the issue will be handled sensitively and discreetly, both by the Registrar and the police. 
     
      
    37 As I have said, I have taken into account all the matters put to me by the defence. I have come to the conclusion, after assessing those matters, that, in the light of the direction I have given the jury and the jury's reaction to it, I cannot, and do not, conclude that the parties, or the public, might entertain any reasonable apprehension that the jury might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the issues involved in the trial. 
     
      
    38 I have addressed this jury on a number of occasions on the need to bring an impartial and unbiased mind to the resolution of the issues involved in the proceedings. I am satisfied that the particular incidents, and the concerns expressed by the jury, in the light of the direction I have given, will not lead to the presence of bias or a lack of partiality in the proceedings. I accept, however, that the ultimate test is an objective one and goes beyond this consideration. In that regard, in the light of the direction I have given and my overall evaluation of the circumstances, I have concluded, as an objective matter, that a fair-minded and informed observer would not reasonably apprehend a lack of impartiality on the part of any of the members of the present jury. 
     
      
    39 That leaves me only to comment on the position of the Crown. I realise that it is unusual for the Court, in the face of the Director’s apparent willingness not to oppose an application for discharge, to stand firm and refuse the application. Even though the situation is unusual, I have come to the clear view that the position of the Crown should not, in the present matter, lead me to a different conclusion. Where the Court has arrived at a firm state of satisfaction that the circumstances, in the light of the direction given, would not, or might not, result in a fair-minded and informed observer entertaining a reasonable apprehension of lack of impartiality, the Court should not abrogate its responsibilities, and should not abandon a trial, because of mere convenience and the possibility of a saving of costs, even where the prospect of an appeal may be in the air. 
     
      
    40 The ultimate concern of the Court is to ensure a fair trial for the accused. Where the Court is convinced a fair trial can be had, and that no miscarriage of justice is likely, it would be quite wrong for the Court to discharge a jury simply because, for reasons not of substance but arising out of mere forensic or other expediency, the Crown has, effectively, been instructed to succumb to a defence application of this kind. The Court must respect the integrity of the institution of trial by jury, just as it must respect the jurors themselves. 
     
      
    41 The Court should not too readily underestimate and devalue the diligence and attentive work already done and being done by the jury in the trial process. A discharge that is not truly warranted would undermine these important considerations and weaken the value and importance of jury service. 
     
      
    42 For those reasons, I decline to order the discharge of the jury.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: After a period of investigation and authorised interception of telephone calls, on 20 December 2006 police executed a search warrant at the applicant’s home at Canley Vale. When the police arrived the applicant and another man were standing at the front door, which the applicant was opening with his keys. The other man was holding a box containing plastic bags of a sugar based cutting agent used with crystalline methylamphetamine (ice). The search found quantities of heroin and crystalline methylamphetamine in different bags and packaging, a considerable number of mobile phones and SIM cards, $10,550 in cash, two pistols and accompanying ammunition, and a round of non-matching calibre ammunition.  
     
      
    2 On 22 December 2006 the police executed a further warrant at the applicant’s home. A New South Wales driver’s licence was found displaying the applicant’s photograph but with a false name and date of birth. The licence had not been issued by the Roads and Traffic Authority, and was a fabrication. 
     
      
    3 The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to four charges brought by Court Attendance Notices, and was committed for sentence to the District Court. Because of technical error in the Court Attendance Notices an indictment was presented in the District Court containing the same four charges, to which the applicant pleaded guilty. He asked that seven offences on a Form One be taken into account in sentencing on the first count in the indictment.  
     
      
    4 The charges in the indictment were as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 1 
      : 
       
       
      Unauthorised possession of a prohibited pistol contrary to s 7(1) of the  
      Firearms Act 
       1996, being a .22 calibre self-loading Jennings pistol found on the search. The offence carried a maximum penalty of 14 years imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 3 years.  
       
       
      Count 2 
      : 
       
       
      Possession of an unregistered pistol contrary to s 36(1) of the  
      Firearms Ac 
      t, being a 9 mm Luger self-loading pistol found on the search. The offence carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. 
       
       
      Count 3 
      : 
       
       
      Supply of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
       1985, being 19.72 grams of crystalline methylamphetamine found on the search. The offence carried a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. 
       
       
      Count 4:  
       
       
      Supply of a prohibited drug contrary to s 25(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and 
        
      Trafficking Act 
      , being 7.29 grams of heroin found on the search. The offence carried the same maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. 
       
      
    5 The seven offences on the Form One were possession of a firearm with defaced identification (the Luger pistol); possession of ammunition without a licence or permit (the various items of ammunition found on the search); two offences of not keeping a firearm safely (the two pistols); possession of an unregistered firearm (the Jennings pistol); dealing with suspected proceeds of crime (the $10,550); and having a false instrument with intent to use (the driver’s licence). 
     
      
    6 The applicant was sentenced as follows - 
     
      
       
      Count 4 
      :  
       
       
      Imprisonment for 2 years commencing on 20 December 2006 with a non-parole period of 1 year 4 months. 
       
       
      Count 3 
      : 
       
       
      Imprisonment for 3 years commencing on 20 June 2007 with a non-parole period of 2 years.  
       
       
      Count 2 
      : 
       
       
      Imprisonment for 3 years commencing on 20 June 2008 with a non-parole period of 2 years. 
       
       
      Count 1 
      : 
       
       
      Imprisonment for 4 years commencing on 20 June 2009 with a non-parole period of 1 year 10 months. 
       
      
    7 The effective total sentence was imprisonment for 6 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 4 months. 
     
      
    8 The offences the subject of counts 3 and 4 were “deemed supply” offences. The learned sentencing judge was satisfied that the applicant was operating as a drug dealer. His Honour recorded his understanding that the applicant had advanced in the pre-sentence report that his possession of the pistols was from concern for the safety of himself and his daughter following two home invasions, at least one of which involved threats being made to kidnap his daughter. However, his Honour was satisfied that the pistols were kept at the applicant’s home “as part of the tools of trade of a drug dealer”. The applicant accepted that it was open for his Honour to make these findings. 
     
      
    9 There were three grounds of appeal against sentence.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1:  
      His Honour erred by failing to find that the applicant’s psychiatric diagnosis mitigated the offences 
      . 
       
      
    10 The applicant had left Vietnam at the age of 18 to seek a better life. He was rescued from a sinking boat and taken to Japan, where he lived for about two years before coming to Australia. At the time of the offences he was aged 39. He had been in a de facto relationship for about 4 years and had an 11 year old daughter from this relationship. His partner had died and the sentencing judge accepted that her death “has had considerable repercussions on the offender”. Following her death the applicant turned to use of alcohol, then use of drugs, at first heroin and then ice and occasionally cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy. He became addicted to heroin, then switched to ice, and when sentenced had not overcome his addiction. 
     
      
    11 According to the applicant via the reports next mentioned, in 1999 he was the victim of a home invasion robbery, which he did not report to the police, and in May 2006 he was the victim of a further home invasion where he was blind-folded and tortured and was threatened that his daughter would be kidnapped if he reported the robbery to the police. As we have said, the sentencing judge did not accept that this explained his possession of the pistols. 
     
      
    12 There were tendered before the sentencing judge a pre-sentence report and a report of Dr Tran, psychiatrist. The applicant relied for this ground on the latter report.  
     
      
    13 Dr Tran recorded a “Provisional Psychiatric Diagnosis (DSM-IV)” of post-traumatic stress syndrome, together with polysubstance abuse in remission, and said - 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Opinion and recommendations 
         
         
        Mr Luu had experienced multiple adverse life-events with lasting psychiatric sequelae. 
         
         
        His relatively late onset of substance use disorder could be understood in the context of unresolved grief, which was subsequently compounded by the traumatic experiences as a victim of a violent crime. 
         
         
        Mr Luu’s lack of effective (non-substance oriented) coping strategies could be attributed to his disadvantaged background and resulting inadequate development of internal (psychological and intellectual) resources. Mr Luu’s lack of English skills would have impacted on his acculturation. The resulting lack of familiarity with the legal and social system could form the basis for misinformed and consequential decisions. 
         
         
        In addition Mr Luu’s psychoactive substance use would have impaired his judgment as to all the legal ramifications of his action. 
         
         
        Mr Luu gave the impression of being a reliable and consistent historian. He did not evidence any personality dysfunctional traits of the antisocial type. He displayed a fair level of insight into the issues underlying his criminal conduct. He appeared motivated for changes. He would have good prospects for rehabilitation. 
         
         
        Prolonged incarceration would be detrimental to Mr Luu’s fragile mental health. The resulting lack of parental care and support would compromise his young daughter’s psychosocial development.” 
        
       
      
    14 The multiple adverse life-events to which Dr Tran was referring appear to have been the applicant’s troubled departure from Vietnam and journey to Australia, the death of his partner, and the home invasions. Relevantly to the psychiatric sequelae, the history recorded by Dr Tran included details of the 2006 home invasion going beyond those in the pre-sentence report and that the applicant had recurrent nightmares of the incident, would often wake at night covered in sweat, and had since become jumpy, irritable and withdrawn. It also included that the applicant said that although he was aware it was illegal to possess firearms, he did not realise the seriousness of his actions. It did not include anything of the same kind about drug dealing. 
     
      
    15 The applicant submitted that Dr Tran’s opinion was a sound basis for a conclusion that, at the time of the offences, he had impaired judgment as to the social impact and the legal and moral seriousness of his criminal conduct, and that the interaction of his post-traumatic stress syndrome with his substance abuse must have combined so as to impair his moral culpability for his offending conduct. He submitted that the sentencing judge was in error in saying only that the death of the applicant’s partner explained his subsequent use of alcohol and then subsequent drug use and that these together provided the background for the offending and explained how the offences came to be committed, and that he was not satisfied there was any nexus between the diagnosis of post-traumatic stress syndrome and the applicant’s conduct in respect of the commission of the offences or that the applicant’s drug addiction at the time amounted to mitigating circumstances. In the applicant’s submission, the post-traumatic stress syndrome and the drug abuse meant that he was not able properly to judge the seriousness of his misconduct and there should have been some measure of reduction in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offending.  
     
      
    16 The report of Dr Tran did not support the applicant’s submissions. The provisional psychiatric diagnosis was really not explained in the opinion and recommendations, and the opinions so far as expressing consequences of the diagnosis were mostly in very general terms and less than definite (“could be understood”, “could be attributed”, “could form the basis”). The sentencing judge noted that it included that the applicant “displayed a fair level of insight into the issues underlying his criminal conduct”. As to a nexus between the applicant’s psychiatric condition and his offending, the possibly misinformed and consequential decisions were attributed not to a psychiatric condition but to lack of familiarity with the legal and social system, and the “impaired … judgment as to all the legal ramifications of his action” was attributed only to the substance abuse and was far less than impaired judgment as to the legal and moral seriousness of the applicant’s offending.  
     
      
    17 The applicant relied in particular on the last-mentioned opinion, which used the more definite phrase “would have”, but it was scarcely a link between the appellant’s psychiatric condition and his offending. Further, the applicant’s recorded lack of realisation that possession of firearms was a serious matter could hardly be accepted when their possession was not for the asserted protection of the applicant and his daughter following a home invasion but as part of the tools of trade in the applicant’s drug dealership, and the absence of any like expression of lack of realisation of the import of the drug dealing was marked. 
     
      
    18 The applicant did not give evidence to support the history as recorded by Dr Tran (see R v Qutami [2001] NSWCCA 353; (2001) 127 A Crim R 369), and consequent on objection taken at the sentencing hearing he did did not rely on the history in the psychiatric report concerning the home invasions beyond what was contained on that subject in the pre-sentence report. There was more in the psychiatric report, including the account of nightmares et cetera, which must have underlain Dr Tran’s provisional psychiatric diagnosis and his opinion and recommendations. Partial taking away of the basis for Dr Tran’s diagnosis and opinion severely compromised reliance upon it.  
     
      
    19 The applicant submitted that even if there was no nexus between his psychiatric condition and his offending, the explanation and background for the offending as accepted by the sentencing judge brought less need for denunciation and general deterrence and for that reason alone the sentences should have been moderated. His Honour took account of those matters to the extent to which they were relevant to the sentencing, and we are not persuaded that he failed adequately to do so. 
     
      
    20 In our opinion, it was well open to the sentencing judge to decline to find that the applicant’s psychiatric condition moderated his culpability or the regard to be had to denunciation or general deterrence as a sentencing consideration. We would not uphold this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2:  
      His Honour erred by finding that the offences were “objectively most serious”. 
       
      
    21 The sentencing judge said - 
     
      
       
        
        “The present offences are objectively most serious. In relation to both the offences of supply prohibited drugs and the firearms offences, general deterrence and punishment are of particular importance. Personal deterrence is also of some significance.  
        
       
       
        
        I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in respect of each of the supply prohibited drug offences that the offender’s conduct in committing each of those offences involves trafficking in a substantial degree. 
        
       
       
        
        In all the circumstances, having regard to the objective seriousness of each of the four present offences, there is no option but to impose upon the offender substantial custodial sentences”. 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    22 His Honour went on to refer to the standard non-parole period of 3 years for the offence of unauthorised possession of a prohibited pistol, noting that it provided “a reference point for sentencing purposes” (R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168) and saying that he was “satisfied that the present offence falls within the middle range of objective seriousness for offences of this type”. In the result, however, the sentencing judge gave reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    23 The applicant said that the quantities of drugs were relatively small, well below the commercial quantities of 250 grams, and that the quantity of heroin was only just above the indictable quantity. He said that the drug offences were “deemed supplies” rather than actual supplies. It was pointed out that the applicant had himself previously been addicted to heroin and was addicted to ice. The ultimate submission was that “this was not an example of the more serious, criminally significant profile of an exploitative, non-using drug dealer”. 
     
      
    24 We do not find useful this comparison with a hypothetical drug dealer. The applicant’s position was to be assessed for itself. The applicant was a drug dealer. Both heroin and ice were found in his possession, in different forms of packaging indicative of a number of future actual supplies. The sentencing judge was entitled to find, as he did, that the applicant’s conduct involved “trafficking in a substantial degree”, the character of the possession of the drugs being informed by the two kinds of drugs, the different forms of packaging, the possession of the pistols, and the possession of the $10,550.  
     
      
    25 In his description “objectively most serious” the sentencing judge was referring globally to all offences. We do not accept the applicant’s further submission that there was inconsistency with his later placing the offence of unauthorised possession of a prohibited pistol in the middle range of objective seriousness. Understood as a whole, in his Honour’s description “most” did not mean at the height of seriousness, but was an expression of emphatic seriousness. This was, in our opinion, an assessment well open to his Honour.  
     
      
    26 The applicant submitted, with reference to sentencing statistics, that the sentence for supplying the crystalline methylamphetamine was demonstrably excessive. He said that the sentence for supplying the heroin was “even more severe” given the small quantity, which he said took it outside the sentencing statistics. The Crown responded that the measure of an appropriate sentence was primarily found in the maximum penalty set by the legislature and the facts of the particular case, rather than such limited guidance as might be obtained from statistics (see Ma and Pham v R [2007] NSWCCA 240 at [91]; R v Allen [2008] NSWCCA 11 at [24]), but also with other statistics from which it was submitted that the sentence for firstmentioned offence was within the range of sentences imposed in other cases. The debate was outside the ground of appeal, save so far as the sentence imposed might be thought to have reflected an excessive view of the objective seriousness of the offences, and did not greatly contribute to whether there was error in that respect. In our opinion there was not; nor in our opinion were the particular sentences outside the range available to the sentencing judge. We would not uphold this ground. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3:  
      His Honour failed to properly apply the principle of totality. 
       
      
    27 The sentencing judge said that each of the sentences had been determined in accordance with the principles enunciated in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610, and that “[i]n order to reflect totality of criminality there will need to be partial accumulation in the sentences to be imposed.” 
     
      
    28 His Honour acted accordingly. The sentences were made partially concurrent and partially cumulative, by staggering their starting dates. The period of each sentence overlapped with the period of the preceding sentence, but the staggering was such that the sentence on count 1 commenced shortly after the expiry of the sentence on count 4. 
     
      
    29 The applicant submitted that the aggregate total sentence and the aggregate non-parole period were both excessive. He submitted that the four offences were substantially connected, the two drug offences being in relation to the applicant’s stock as a drug dealer and brought separately only because there were two different types of drugs, and his possession of the pistols being connected with his activities as a drug dealer. In the applicant‘s submission, it was wrong to stagger the starting dates of the two drug offences and it was wrong to stagger the starting dates of the two firearms offences, because each pair of offences bore substantial connections, and greater concurrency should have been given to the two sets of offences. In his submission, there was the risk of double punishment insofar as the drug offences may have been regarded as more serious because the pistols were held as part of the drug dealing enterprise or the firearms offences may have been regarded as more serious for the same reason, and that on looking at the totality of the criminal behaviour the aggregate sentence was not “just and appropriate” (Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59 at 62-3).  
     
      
    30 We do not agree that there was such connection that greater concurrency was called for.  
     
      
    31 In Cahyadi v R [2007] NSWCCA 1 at [27] Howie J said that - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … there is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively. The issue is determined by the application of the principle of totality of criminality: can the sentence for one offence comprehend and reflect the criminality for the other offence? If it can, the sentences ought to be concurrent otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. If not, the sentences should be at least partly cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality.”  
        
       
      
    32 Possession of the two different kinds of drugs giving rise to the “deemed supply” offences is not properly regarded as one episode of criminality. There were two deemed supplies, as there would be two (or more) actual supplies were the different drugs to be sold to two (or more) purchasers in the course of the applicant’s drug dealing. Nor is the criminality in the possession of the pistols, and two pistols one of which was a prohibited pistol involves greater criminality than one, to any substantial degree reflected in the sentences for the drug offences. The drug dealing could be carried on without firearms; that the applicant had them in his possession in connection with his drug dealing was significant additional criminality, and there was no double counting. The Firearms Act gives effect to the significant legislative policy of strict control upon the possession of firearms, and offences against it inimical to that policy called for substantial recognition in their own right: see R v Cromarty [2004] NSWCCA 54; R v Tolley [2004] NSWCCA 165. 
     
      
    33 The applicant’s submission also left out of account the Form One offences. In deciding the concurrency and accumulation the sentencing judge was exercising a discretion, see R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66. In our opinion, no error has been shown in the exercise of the discretion, and we would not uphold this ground. 
     
      
       
      The result 
       
      
    34 In our opinion, leave to appeal should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed.

   JUDGMENT1. I have to make a decision about whether or not I give a direction to this jury. The direction is known by reference to the case that it is based on, Narendra Prasad (1979) 2 A Crim R 45. It is commonly referred to as the Prasad direction.2. Mr Taylor, counsel for the accused, has applied for such a direction. He advanced his argument just before the Crown Prosecutor closed his case in the absence of the jury but knowing, as has just now occurred, that the Crown Prosecutor would close his case.3. This is a case concerning a sexual assault. The complainant has given evidence and has been cross-examined by Mr Taylor. Mr Taylor’s argument for a Prasad direction is that the cross-examination has exposed significant inconsistencies between the complainant’s evidence and the statement or statements which she gave to the police. There may also be inconsistencies between her account and some evidence of other witnesses. He argues that the Crown case, because of those inconsistencies, lacks cogency.4. Whether or not I give a Prasad direction is a matter entirely within my discretion. In R v Pahuja (1987) 30 A Crim R 118, Cox J with whom Johnston J agreed, referred to the circumstances in which such a direction is given as “usually some serious weakness in the Crown case that has emerged during its presentation” (at 145). His Honour pointed out that the “typical occasion for it in a sexual case will be the discrediting of the complainant in the witness box - admitted lies or plain contradictions or vacillations - or important contradictions with other Crown witnesses.”5. In R v Reardon [2002] NSWCCA 203 Simpson J, sitting in the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal, dealt with an argument that the trial judge had wrongly rejected a Prasad direction. Hodgson JA and Barr J agreed with her Honour. Her Honour pointed out that the power to give the direction was entirely discretionary and depended, amongst other matters, “upon the assessment of the trial judge of the weight of the evidence against the particular accused” (at 157). Her Honour observed that, as was pointed out in Prasad, “a direction by the judge to the jury as to the weight it should attribute to admissible evidence intrudes upon the jury function.” Her Honour noted that an appropriate Prasad direction carefully avoids trespassing upon that function. But, as her Honour proceeded, nevertheless “to give such a direction can carry with it a suggestion to the jury that admissible evidence should be given little or no weight.” Her Honour said that a trial judge giving a Prasad direction has to tread a very fine line to avoid trespassing upon the jury function.6. I have decided not to give a Prasad direction. I appreciate the argument of Mr Taylor about the inconsistencies. These are matters, in my opinion, which the jury needs to take into account in weighing up whether or not they accept the complainant’s evidence beyond reasonable doubt. Whilst Mr Taylor will no doubt argue in his address that the inconsistencies to which he has referred must result in the jury not accepting her evidence, it may be that the jury would regard such inconsistencies as being the result of the comparison between giving a statement at a time recently close to what the complainant claims are traumatic events and giving evidence in court some ten months later. There are, in my opinion, appropriate arguments both ways on the question of the acceptability of the complainant’s evidence. 7. I regard this question in this case as really a matter for the jury and I regard it as inappropriate for me to, by giving a Prasad direction, as Simpson J says, indirectly suggest to the jury that the evidence should be given little or no weight. For that reason I do not propose to give the direction.

      JUDGMENT ON SENTENCE 
       
       
      
    1 KIRBY J: On 16 June 2007 Gerard Fleming was stabbed whilst in a toilet block at Narrabeen. Two wounds were inflicted, one to the heart. Somehow, he managed to walk from the toilet block to a bus seat on the other side of Pittwater Road, where he collapsed. An ambulance was called. However, within the hour he was dead. 
     
      
    2 On 25 July 2007, CR was charged with his murder. On 29 August 2008, after a short trial, the Jury returned a verdict of not guilty of murder, but guilty of manslaughter. 
     
      
    3 It remains for me to pass sentence. The sentence must be consistent with the Jury verdict. It is therefore necessary that I first determine the facts relevant to the sentencing discretion. Where the facts are adverse, they must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Where they favour CR, it is enough that they should be established on the balance of probabilities. 
     
      
       
      Background. 
       
      
    4 Mr Gerard Fleming was a man in his mid thirties. He suffered from Asperger’s Syndrome, which is a form of autism. He lived alone in a flat at Narrabeen. He did not work and was in receipt of a disability pension.  
     
      
    5 Mr Fleming was homosexual. There are, on the Warringah peninsular, as there are throughout Sydney, locations known to some where homosexual men meet at night and engage in consensual sexual intercourse. The toilet block on Berry Reserve at Narrabeen was one such location. Mr Fleming occasionally attended that toilet block at night in order to meet other men and thereafter engage in consensual intercourse. 
     
      
    6 CR was born in August 1990. At the time of the incident he was 16 years old. He was two months short of his 17th birthday. He was still at school, in Year 11. 
     
      
       
      The incident. 
       
      
    7 Some time after 10.00 pm on Saturday 16 June 2007, Mr Fleming went to the toilet block on Berry Reserve at Narrabeen. The block is set back from the road. It remained open after dark. In June 2007, there was no lighting within the block. There were, however, ventilation openings at the top of each side wall which permitted the penetration of some light from the surrounding area. It was a dark and stormy night. It may be assumed that inside the toilet block was very dark, even after one’s eyes became used to the dark. 
     
      
    8 CR went to the toilet block at about 10.30 pm. He said, and I accept as probable, that he did not know that it was a meeting place for homosexual men. His purpose was to go to the toilet. He had attended a number of parties that evening. Although under age, he had, over a number of hours, consumed a significant quantity of beer as well as a bourbon and coke. The quantity of alcohol consumed was not unusual. He, like many of his contemporaries, had been drinking each weekend since the age of about 14 years. On this evening he was not drunk, but he was not sober. The alcohol he consumed was, I believe, a factor in the misjudgement he ultimately made later that evening. 
     
      
    9 CR was carrying a knife. It was a folding fishing knife that he first acquired about a year before. It had a reasonably lengthy blade and was obviously dangerous. He had, some months before, been attacked by a number of youths and injured, although not seriously. He said that occasionally thereafter he carried a knife for his own protection. Unfortunately, he had the knife with him on this evening. His foolishness in having such a weapon at his disposal was demonstrated by what later occurred. 
     
      
    10 Having gone to the toilet block to urinate, CR went outside to an area which was a carpark. He had with him a plastic bag. Inside the bag were several cans and several small bottles of beer, the remnants of the beer that he had taken to the various parties. One gathers that, to some extent, he was filling in time. He had made arrangements to spend the night at a friend’s house, who lived nearby. In the course of the evening he had become separated from his friend. Each, however, had a mobile phone and planned to make contact by that means.  
     
      
    11 Before that occurred and whilst CR was outside the toilet block, Mr Gerard Fleming came out of the block. One infers that he had been inside the block when CR first entered. The two began talking. CR said that he did most of the talking. He did not notice that Mr Fleming was disabled, although it registered with him that he spoke a little more slowly. CR said that he offered Mr Fleming a beer, which he accepted. Together they drank and talked. It then began to rain. In order to continue their conversation they went inside the toilet block, sheltering from the rain. 
     
      
    12 After a time, CR said that he needed to go to the toilet again, this time to move his bowels. He entered a cubicle and closed the door. The door had been cut down so that it did not offer complete privacy. Mr Fleming continued to talk to him from outside the cubicle. At one point he came over and lent on the door, looking directly at CR, who was then seated on the toilet. CR said that this made him feel uncomfortable. He asked Mr Fleming to move away from the door, which he did. 
     
      
    13 However, Mr Fleming later returned to the same position. Again CR, according to his account, which I accept as probable, asked him to move back. Again he did so. 
     
      
    14 Ultimately, CR left the cubicle and washed his hands. They continued to talk. He offered Mr Fleming a second beer, which was accepted. Together they drank. Mr Fleming then went to the end cubicle to go to the toilet. CR asserted, and I accept, that when he emerged a short time later he had his trousers around his knees. His underpants were still on. 
     
      
    15 CR said that again this made him feel uncomfortable. He told Mr Fleming to pull his pants up. Mr Fleming, however, asked whether “he had ever tried to wedgie someone”. As he said this, Mr Fleming approached CR and touched his hips with both hands, one hand on either hip. CR pushed him back. He again felt uncomfortable and nervous. He claimed he had no interest in a homosexual encounter. 
     
      
    16 Mr Fleming, however, appeared to regard CR’s reaction as a joke. Again he approached him, chuckling and continuing to talk about “wedgies”. On this occasion, however, he placed his arms around CR and locked his hands behind CR’s back in a bear hug. According to the account of CR, which I accept, he held him very tightly. The result was that his arms were pinned to his sides. 
     
      
    17 CR had his hands in the pockets of his jeans. They were baggy jeans with large pockets. In the right hand pocket he had the knife. He asked Mr Fleming to let go of him. He also struggled to free his arms. He repeated his request to let him go. The struggle continued for five or ten seconds, whilst Mr Fleming continued to talk about “wedgies”. 
     
      
    18 Ultimately, CR opened the blade of the knife and managed to free his right hand sufficiently to stab Mr Fleming twice. The first wound was to the abdomen. It was delivered with some force. The second followed a split second later. CR said that he thought that he had missed with the second blow. In fact he had not missed. The second wound, one infers, was the wound to the heart that proved fatal. 
     
      
    19 CR, in his evidence, described his state of mind at the time he used the knife. He said that he was in a “shocked mood”. He did not know what to do. He was panicking. It all happened very fast. He just wanted to get the other man off him. Mr Fleming appeared to CR to be a much bigger man. At the time this all happened CR was much shorter than at the time of the trial, a year later. He was also much lighter. The deceased was 170 cms tall (5 foot 7 inches). He weighed 85.5 kilograms (13 and a half stone). CR, at the time, was about the same height or perhaps a little shorter. He weighed about 65 kilograms. He said that as Mr Fleming held him in a bear hug, he feared that he may be raped or sexually assaulted. His perception was no doubt affected by the alcohol he had consumed. He said, and I accept, that he is not homophobic.  
     
      
    20 I accept as probable CR’s account of his state of mind even though, with the wisdom of hindsight, I also accept that the deceased had no such purpose in mind. He was, by all accounts, a gentle and childlike man who was utterly benign. His only interest was in consensual sex. This was, in every sense, a tragedy arising from a failure to communicate and a misunderstanding. Counsel for CR described what happened as the collision of two different worlds, with catastrophic consequences. The tragedy was made possible because CR happened to have at his disposal, in his pocket, a lethal weapon which, in the agony of that moment, he chose to use. His action was a reaction to the conduct of the deceased. I accept that, in the state of mind I have described, and in the circumstances as he perceived them, he felt it necessary to defend himself by stabbing the victim. However, the use of a knife and the infliction of two wounds was plainly not reasonable and was excessive. CR at no stage lost control. Unquestionably he appreciated that the knife would inflict very serious injuries. However, there was no intention to kill the deceased. 
     
      
       
      Subjective case. 
       
      
    21 Let me pass from the offence to the offender. CR was, as mentioned, 16 years old at the time of the offence. The offence was in June. He turned 17 in August. He is now 18 years old and still a young man. 
     
      
    22 CR did have a conviction arising out of an incident in February 2006, when he was 15 years old. He and an older friend were charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The victim was punched with a closed fist to the right eye, causing fractures to the surrounding bones. In October 2006, the Children’s Court, by way of penalty, imposed a six month bond without supervision. The victim was alleged to have thrown fire crackers at a dog, who ran onto the road and was injured. The dog died two weeks later. 
     
      
    23 A report of Mr Greg Robertson, an experienced social worker with the Department of Juvenile Justice, was tendered. Mr Robertson interviewed CR a number of times. He spoke to his parents at their home. He also made contact with CR’s Principal and others. CR did not seek to minimise his offence. He appreciated the enormity of what he had done. He accepted responsibility. CR said, and Mr Robertson accepted, that he felt deep remorse for his actions. Indeed, the effect upon him has been profound. He has found living in custody emotionally difficult. He is now somewhat withdrawn and emotionally guarded.  
     
      
    24 The report dealt with CR’s prospects of rehabilitation. There is much to be said that is positive. He comes from a close and loving family, who continue to support him. He is the middle child of three. He gets on well with both his brothers. 
     
      
    25 It will be remembered that CR was in Year 11 when the offence was committed. He attended a private school at Warriewood. He was well liked by students and staff. He had no history of violence or aggressive behaviour. He was described as an average student, who completed his work as required. 
     
      
    26 CR was arrested on 25 July 2007. He has been in custody since that date. He has used his time well. He enrolled in a correspondence school and has completed three courses for his Higher School Certificate. He hopes to become a carpenter. He excelled in the subject of Construction when at school. 
     
      
    27 The report deals with the risk factors of reoffending. CR’s crime was impulsive. There was no significant pattern of violent or aggressive behaviour. The only worrisome feature, according to Mr Robertson, was his abuse of alcohol from an early age and, to a lesser extent, his use of cannabis. 
     
      
    28 I accept that CR is remorseful. A great many people wrote letters on his behalf which spoke of their regard for CR and his family. I accept that he has very good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      Sentence. 
       
      
    29 The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years. The starting point in sentencing is the fact that a human life has been taken. Human life is sacred. There is a community expectation that it will be protected and those responsible for taking it will be punished. But, manslaughter, perhaps more than any other offence, varies in the criminality which it comprehends. Each case of manslaughter very much depends upon the circumstances. In Queen v Hill (1981) 3 A Crim R 397, Street CJ said this at: (402) 
     
      
       
        
        “It has been said that manslaughter, perhaps, beyond any other crime is protean. The circumstances leading to the felonious taking of human life being regarded as manslaughter rather than murder can vary infinitely, and it is not always easy to determine in any given case what should be done in the matter of sentence. At the start it should be recognised that the felonious taking of a human life is recognised both in the  
        Crimes Act, 
          
        1900 
         and in the community at large as one of the most dreadful crimes in the criminal calendar. The courts have, however, over the decades gradually manifested the willingness to recognise factual contexts which provide some basis for understanding the human tragedies that can lead to the taking of a life. The manifestation of this humanitarian tendency is necessarily attended by the utmost caution. It can be seen to be constantly written in the decisions of the courts and in the enactments of the legislature that the taking of a human life is a grave action calling for a correspondingly grave measure of criminal justice being meted out to the guilty party. 
        
       
       
        
        In such a case as the present, whether there is material justifying a degree of understanding and of sympathy towards the appellant, the task of sentencing is particularly difficult. It is necessary to evaluate the demands of the criminal justice system, the expectations of the community at large, the subjective circumstances of the person coming forward for criminal judgment and the interests of society in protecting itself and its members from criminal activity amounting, as in the present case, to the taking of a life.” 
        
       
      
    30 Here, CR’s impulsive act arose out of panic. But for the fact that he had a knife in his possession, both parties would have walked away, each recognising that there had been a misunderstanding. The catastrophic consequences which followed for each can be directly traced to the knife which CR chose to take that evening, so that it was available as a weapon when he felt that he was under attack. As Hidden J has recently said, when passing sentence on another young offender, “the prevalence of young people carrying knives, and the community’s abhorrence of it, hardly need to be emphasised” (R v SSA & Siose [2007] NSWSC 1202 at [28]). 
     
      
    31 Nonetheless, contrary to the submission of the Crown, I do not believe that this was a juvenile committing an adult crime, where the fact of his youth was largely immaterial. CR’s decision to take the knife that evening, supposedly for his own protection, was the product of immaturity, as was his decision to use the knife in the unusual situation in which he found himself (cf TM v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 158, per Hall J, para [33]). 
     
      
    32 Nonetheless, CR’s conduct which led to the death of Gerard Fleming remains a significant offence, where the sentence imposed must reflect this Court’s denunciation of such conduct and must be such as will deter others from like behaviour. 
     
      
    33 The suffering that has been induced by CR’s crime has been enormous. Gerard Fleming was a much loved and gifted man who was well known in the community in which he lived. His mother read a poignant victim’s impact statement to the Court where she described the devastation to her and to her family through his senseless death. She stated that Gerard was precious to her and the family and, in reality, was no threat to anyone. I must, of course, deal with such material in accordance with the principles set out in R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. 
     
      
    34 Counsel for the Crown and for CR have provided me with a number of cases in which the offender has been sentenced for manslaughter arising in circumstances of excessive self defence (R v SSA & Siose (supra): R v Ward [2005] NSWSC 266: Ward v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 321; (2006) 166 A Crim R 273: Vuni v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 171). I have also been provided with statistics from the Judicial Commission. The statistics are of limited value, since they only involve eleven offenders and give no insight into the circumstances of each offence. Each case very much depends upon its own facts. I am, however, assisted by the recommendations of Mr Robertson in the report from Juvenile Justice, where he said this: (p 10) 
     
      
       
        
        “The writer notes the seriousness of the matters before the Court and the limitations in sentencing options available given the severity of the offence. It is therefore recommended that in this case a shorter period of incarceration followed by a longer period of parole supervision as provided under the  
        Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 
         1999 would be appropriate given the circumstances outlined in the writer’s assessment. This would support community re-integration and community based therapeutic treatment. In this circumstance, the Court may wish to impose specific conditions in a parole order. 
        
       
       
        
        The writer strongly recommends that [CR] be given the opportunity to engage in immediate therapeutic intervention that is offence focus given his current level of empathy and remorse and acceptance of responsibility for the matters before the Court.” 
        
       
      
    35 I adopt each of these recommendations. I find special circumstances, for the reasons given by Mr Robertson. I recommend that CR be given the opportunity to engage in immediate therapeutic intervention whilst in custody. 
     
      
    36 CR you are sentenced to a non parole period of 3 years and 6 months, commencing on 25 July 2007 and expiring on 24 January 2011; with an additional term of 3 years and 6 months expiring on 24 July 2014. The total term, therefore, is a period of 7 years imprisonment in which there is a non parole period of 3½ years. 
     
      
    37 I make an order, under s 19(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987, directing that CR’s sentence be served as a juvenile offender.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: These proceedings were originally commenced by summons filed in this court on 31 October 2008. On that day the proceedings came before me in my capacity as duty judge with the plaintiff seeking certain orders pursuant to s 10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990. The plaintiff is the New South Wales Crime Commission. Todd Anthony O'Connor is the sole defendant. The terms of the orders Sought were that no person is to dispose of or attempt to dispose of or otherwise deal with or attempt to otherwise deal with the interest in property of the defendant, which property is described in a schedule with which I was provided. A further order was sought pursuant to section 10.4 of the Act that the Public Trustee take control of the defendant's interest in the whole of the property so described. The property in question referred to in the schedule to the order is described as $635,100 seized by police during the execution of a warrant at certain premises in St John Crescent, Woolloomooloo on 6 October 2008. 
     
      
    2 In support of the application in the summons for those and other orders, the plaintiff relied upon an affidavit of Jonathon Lee Spark sworn on 30 October 2008. Mr Spark is a certified practising accountant employed by the plaintiff as Assistant Director of Financial Investigation and was appropriately, on the face of the affidavit, said to be authorised by the plaintiff generally to act as such for the purposes of section 10 or Part 4 of the Act. Mr Spark deposed to a suspicion that Eamad Sada had engaged in a serious crime related activity or activities, namely a conspiracy to supply prohibited drugs contrary to a provision of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The suspicion held by Mr Spark was based on a number of matters to which he then deposed in his affidavit. Those matters include reference by him to the contents of a 28 page fact sheet prepared by a member of the Australian Federal Police and forwarded to the plaintiff, a search of the records of the New South Wales Police COPS system and to other information described in some short detail provided to the plaintiff by a registered informant. Part of that information included an allegation that Mr Sada and the defendant were involved in the manufacture and supply of prohibited drugs and that the property that was the subject of the application may have been the product of that activity or some of it. Mr Spark specifically deposed to a belief that the defendant had an interest in that property. He set out in his affidavit the basis for that belief in terms to which it is presently unnecessary in detail to refer.  
     
      
    3 I have read the whole of Mr Spark's affidavit and the documents that are annexed to it. In my opinion in all of the circumstances of the case Mr Spark had reasonable grounds for the suspicion that he formed and to which he deposed in the affidavit to which I have referred. It was upon the basis of Mr Spark's affidavit and my view that he had reasonable grounds for having formed the suspicion to which he deposed that I made the orders sought by the plaintiff on 31 October 2008.

      2007/5907 R v MICHAEL KUTSCHERA 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 10 September 2008 the Crown presented an indictment charging the offender, Michael Kutschera, with the murder of Lukas Gleeson. The Crown alleged that he murdered the deceased by deliberately driving over him as he lay prone on a footpath in Sydney Street, Muswellbrook in the early morning of 21 July 2007. The offender entered a plea of not guilty. On 24 September 2008 the jury convicted him of murder.  
     
      
    2 The forensic and scientific evidence established that it was the offender’s Nissan Patrol that killed the deceased. The defence did not challenge that evidence. The single issue in dispute at the trial was whether the offender was the driver of the Nissan Patrol.  
     
      
    3 The defence case was that a man, bearing an uncanny likeness to the offender, took the Nissan Patrol from where it was parked at the rear of the offender’s home in Sydney Street at around 2.50am on 21 July 2007, drove it a short distance towards where the same man had earlier been involved in a fight with one of the deceased’s friends and then, after killing the deceased, drove back to the offender’s house, washed the front wheels of the car with a view to removing any evidence that may have associated the car with the murder, and left.  
     
      
    4 The offender gave evidence that he was not that person and not the person who was involved in the fight in Sydney Street. He said that when his car was taken and used to kill the deceased he was not at home but out walking.  
     
      
    5 By its verdict the jury must be taken to have rejected the offender’s evidence as untrue. 
     
      
    The pre-trial proceedings6 On 25 August 2008 the Crown presented an indictment jointly charging this offender and Adam Newbold with the deceased’s murder. Both men entered pleas of not guilty. This offender then applied for a separate trial on the basis that were he to be tried jointly with Mr Newbold, highly prejudicial and inadmissible evidence would be introduced and that an unfair trial would result. That evidence consisted of a lengthy record of interview in which Mr Newbold nominated the offender as the driver of the Nissan Patrol and recounted, in detail, the events that culminated in the deceased’s death. He gave a graphic account of seeing the deceased killed and what the offender said both at the time that he drove over the deceased and afterwards. I directed that the two men be tried separately and, since it was the Crown’s intention to try this offender first, I directed that there be no publication of the pre-trial proceedings or their outcome.  
     
      
        
      
    7 On 9 September 2008 Mr Newbold was re-arraigned before me and entered a plea of not guilty to murder and not guilty to a charge of affray laid pursuant to s 93C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. He entered pleas of guilty to failing without reasonable excuse to provide information to police to secure the apprehension and prosecution of this offender in relation to the death of the deceased contrary to s 316(1) of the Crimes Act, and an assault occasioning actual bodily harm of the deceased contrary to s 59(1) of the Crimes Act. The Crown accepted his pleas of guilty in full discharge of the indictment. In passing sentence in accordance with the provisions of s 10 and s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I took into account the fact that Mr Newbold agreed to give evidence against this offender at his trial, consistent with his account to police on his arrest.  
     
      
    The facts 
     
      
    8 On the evening of 20 July 2007 the deceased met with a number of his friends at the Railway Hotel in Muswellbrook to celebrate the 18th birthday of a young woman. The deceased arrived with Tony Matthews. The offender and Mr Newbold also went to the Railway Hotel that night. They had known one another in a work-related capacity over the previous twelve months but did not share anything other than a casual friendship. This evening was the first occasion that they had socialised together. Although the offender, Mr Newbold, and the deceased and his party of friends were together in the hotel over an extended number of hours they did not intermingle as a group. 9 At some point in the evening the deceased confronted Mr Newbold over some unwanted attention he was showing the young woman whose birthday was being celebrated. She was also Michael Matthews’ girlfriend. Michael Matthews is Tony Matthews’ younger brother. One of the deceased’s friends intervened and the matter was apparently settled without the argument descending into any violence. I am satisfied that the offender was not involved in the incident. I am also satisfied that he did not know the deceased or his friends.10 The hotel closed at around 2am. The offender gave evidence that he left well before closing time and walked home alone, where he remained for a short time before leaving to visit his girlfriend. The jury must also have rejected this evidence as untrue. I am satisfied that he left the hotel at or around closing time and that once outside he was involved in a minor incident with another patron in the course of which he was punched to the face by Tony Matthews. Mr Newbold intervened on his behalf and they walked away together in the direction of Sydney Street. 11 As the offender and Mr Newbold were making their way along Sydney Street in the direction of the offender’s home, they were verbally and then physically accosted by the deceased, Tony Matthews and two other men who approached them from behind. Although it is not clear whether the deceased was the aggressor in a physical sense, it would appear that the source of the renewed conflict was Mr Newbold’s behaviour earlier in the evening and that either the deceased called on the others to support him in confronting Mr Newbold, or the other men took it upon themselves to assault Mr Newbold in defence of the deceased. At this point, the offender became embroiled in the fight either defending himself against a renewed attack by Tony Matthews, or defending Mr Newbold, or both. I am satisfied that Tony Matthews, the deceased and the two other men were both well affected by alcohol at this time. I am also satisfied that Mr Newbold, on his own admission, was well affected by alcohol. I am not in a position to make any positive finding as to whether, or to what extent, the offender was affected by alcohol. 12 In the course of the fight the offender was again punched to the face by Tony Matthews. This time he had his head forced into an electricity box. Mr Newbold managed to wrest himself free of his attackers and ran off along Sydney Street. The other two men pursued him. He hid in a house in a side street. His attackers did not find him and they left the area. It would appear that soon thereafter the offender managed to escape from Tony Matthews and ran off along Sydney Street directly to his house, at number 98 Sydney Street, about 300 metres away. Once there he got the Nissan Patrol and headed back along Sydney Street at high speed. 13 Meanwhile Tony Matthews and the deceased continued to walk down Sydney Street. They left the footpath a short distance from where the fight had taken place to urinate in a side alley.  
     
      
    14 The deceased emerged from the alley before Tony Matthews at which time, and it would seem quite coincidentally, Mr Newbold also emerged from the nearby side street where he had been hiding. The two men confronted one another outside the Sydney Tyre Centre. The yard was not lit but there was a streetlight close by. Despite what I am satisfied were Mr Newbold’s attempts to bring the dispute to an end by the offer of a handshake, the deceased swung at him. Both men fell or wrestled each other to the ground in the process of which the deceased’s head struck the footpath. Mr Newbold succeeded in gaining the advantage over the deceased by pinning his shoulders to the ground. The two men were in this position as the offender drove up Sydney Street in the Nissan Patrol.  
     
      
    Did the offender intend to kill the deceased?15 Whatever the offender’s intentions might have been in getting his car and driving back along Sydney Street, there is nothing to suggest that he had any particular animus towards the deceased. At worst he may have intended a retaliatory attack on Tony Matthews as the person who had assaulted him twice within the space of less than an hour. Importantly, when he ran off and when he returned with the car he could not have known there was any resumption of the conflict between the deceased and Mr Newbold. I am further satisfied that it was only when he saw the two men fighting on the footpath (and likely identified Mr Newbold as one of them) that he made the decision to involve himself, and to use the car as a weapon of intervention. Were his intentions otherwise I fail to see how, in one continuous driving sequence, he would have crossed to the incorrect side of Sydney Street, mounted the footpath at the point where the driveway to the tyre yard crossed the footpath, ordered Mr Newbold to get out of the way and, by extending his head from the driver’s window, deliberately manoeuvre the front driver’s wheel at and over the person on the ground. When he saw Mr Newbold jump clear of the car he must have been aware that the deceased could not, or did not, move out of the way and, since he did not pause at this point, but instead accelerated at and across the deceased’s upper body as he lay prone on the footpath, I am satisfied that he did so with the intention of killing him. I am also satisfied that Mr Newbold gave truthful and reliable evidence when he described that driving manoeuvre. He also described seeing the deceased being effectively shunted under the front wheel along the footpath such as to end on his stomach with his left cheek against the footpath and his neck at an acute angle. It is not clear, from his evidence, whether the rear wheels also came into contact with the deceased at that time. 16 Mr Newbold’s eyewitness account is supported by the injuries revealed on autopsy. The forensic pathologist, Dr Lyons, described ground impact abrasions with an overall dimension of 210 by 150 millimetres on the left cheek of the deceased. There was also significant subcutaneous haemorrhaging into the outer aspect of the left shoulder and the left upper arm. Dr Lyons also observed abrasions and deep scratches measuring 300 by 110 millimetres in the region of the deceased’s lower abdomen and hip.  
     
      
    17 Over the front of the upper trunk of the deceased, above the neckline and below the collarbone, Dr Lyons observed an area of faint stippled imprint bruising and abrasion consistent with pressure marks from clothing with the same general pattern of injury across the back and directly beneath the deceased’s shoulder blades. This was associated with tyre imprints consistent with the tyres from the Nissan Patrol which were revealed on the deceased’s outer clothing under ultra violet light. So far as the bruising was concerned, Dr Lyons was of the view that it was associated with the application of moderate to severe force.  
     
      
    18 There were no bony injuries below the abrasions in the deceased’s hip region. Dr Lyons was of the view that were a vehicle to have driven over the upper or lower limbs of the deceased he would have expected fracturing or, at the very least, significant soft tissue injury. He saw neither. 19 The most significant injury was a complex pattern of injuries in the deceased’s head and neck region. Dr Lyons identified very substantial injuries to his facial bones and the base of his skull. He described a complex fracture of all the facial bones, associated with a vertical fracture of the mandible in the midline and on the left hand side. There was also a complex hinge type skull fracture through the middle and anterior cranial fossa associated with the transection of the upper pons - the area where the spinal cord enters into the main cerebral hemispheres of the brain. Dr Lyons was of the view that the pattern of the injuries to the head and neck would have caused immediate death. 20 Dr Lyons also identified internal injuries to the deceased’s lungs and heart and some tears to the spleen and organs under the rib cage without associated fracturing of the ribs. These were features of a major crush injury. Dr Lyons could not discern any mark from a tyre of a vehicle on the upper head and neck of the deceased associated with the complex of injuries to that region. He was nevertheless of the view that the injuries may very likely have been caused by a motor vehicle being driven in the way the Crown contended in that a vehicle passing over the upper body of a person lying prone on the ground would very likely force the head against the ground and, dependent upon the degree of pressure and the position of the deceased at that time, the injury to the lower part of the skull would also likely have been sustained in that way.21 After driving over the deceased the offender drove off the gutter, stopping momentarily to order Mr Newbold into the car, before he executed a sweeping u-turn and drove back to his house. I am satisfied that at this time the offender was intent on ensuring that Mr Newbold did not contact the police or the ambulance and disclose what he had witnessed. The offender could not have known at this time that Tony Matthews was hiding in the alley and was also a witness to the killing.22 What occurred from the time he drove away, until the offender was arrested at 9.10am that morning, is relevant to sentence as much for what it reveals about the offender’s intentions at the time he killed the deceased as it does about his determination to avoid the consequences of his actions. 23 After killing the deceased he drove into his front yard and went into the house with Mr Newbold. Mr Newbold was extremely agitated and upset. The offender, on the other hand, left not long after in the Nissan Patrol telling Mr Newbold he was going back “to find the other guy”. After the offender drove away Mr Newbold made his way home on foot. 
     
      
    Did the offender drive over the deceased a second time?24 Although I am satisfied that the offender drove back to where he had killed the deceased, and that consistent with the police scientific evidence, he mounted the gutter and passed along the footpath a second time, I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he ran over the body a second time. I do not regard the forensic evidence as compelling that finding. Tony Matthews was the only witness to what occurred when the offender returned and, while he claimed the Nissan Patrol, driven by the offender, struck the deceased a second time, I am unable to rely upon his evidence for sentencing purposes. Not only was his view of the footpath and the deceased obscured by having taken up a fresh hiding place at the rear of the front yard of the Sydney Tyre Centre, but his state of inebriation or shock, or both, renders his account unreliable. I accept that he was an honest witness but that in critical respects he was mistaken as to what he saw.  25 Assuming that the offender returned to the scene with the intention of finding Tony Matthews (as he announced to Mr Newbold) I am satisfied that when he found the scene apparently deserted he took the opportunity to see whether the person he had run over was dead or injured. Since I am satisfied that Mr Gleeson was deceased at that time (and that this would have been obvious to the offender given that his head was lying in pooled blood and that he was motionless) it is unnecessary for me to consider what the offender would have done were he to have found Tony Matthews, or were he to have found Mr Gleeson alive. Suffice to say that quite apart from his chilling lack of empathy for the deceased, who he not only killed but who he had left lying on the footpath a second time, to be found, so far as he knew or cared, by a casual passer-by, his motives from this time and in the events that followed displayed nothing short of a calculated self interest. 26 When he arrived back at his home a second time he washed the front wheels of the car and left it parked at the rear of his house. I am satisfied that he then drove to Mr Newbold’s home in a different car, with renewed concern that Mr Newbold would either volunteer information to police or that he would be unable to withstand any police questioning were he spoken to by police as a result of someone informing them that he had been seen fighting earlier in the evening with the person who the offender knew then to be dead. I am satisfied that despite telling Mr Newbold that he “struck him again” the offender was telling a lie. Whether he did so out of bravado or to convince Mr Newbold that Mr Gleeson was in fact dead, I cannot say. I am satisfied however that he then persuaded Mr Newbold to accompany him to where he had left the deceased with a view to pretending to be a curious observer of a hit and run accident and to thereby deflect any unwanted attention in the event that the police were in attendance. Again, I emphasise the offender could not have known Tony Matthews had witnessed the killing.27 Between the time when the offender drove back to the scene in the Nissan Patrol a second time, and when he walked into the scene with Mr Newbold, Tony Matthews had called 000. The police and ambulance were in attendance as the offender and Mr Newbold walked into the area. Tony Matthews had apparently already nominated Mr Newbold, by name, as a person of interest and he was arrested. The offender walked away and went home. He was arrested later that morning after Mr Newbold was interviewed.  
     
      
    Relevant principles  
     
      
    28 In sentencing the offender for murder it is necessary for me to have regard to s 19A of the Crimes Act and s 21 and s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (“the Sentencing Act”). 
     
      
    29 Section 19A of the Crimes Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person who commits the crime of murder is liable to imprisonment for life.  
         
        (2) A person sentenced to imprisonment for life for the crime of murder is to serve that sentence for the term of the person’s natural life.  
         
        (3) Nothing in this section affects the operation of section 21 (1) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999  
        (which authorises the passing of a lesser sentence than imprisonment for life).”  
        
       
      
    30 Section 21 of the Sentencing Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If by any provision of an Act an offender is made liable to imprisonment for life, a court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a specified term.  
         
        (2) If by any provision of an Act or statutory rule an offender is made liable to imprisonment for a specified term, a court may nevertheless impose a sentence of imprisonment for a lesser term.” 
        
       
      
    31 Section 61 of that Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A court is to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life on a person who is convicted of murder if the court is satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence.” 
        
       
      
    32 The Crown did not submit that a sentence of life imprisonment should be imposed in this case conceding (appropriately in my view) that the offence did not fall within the worst category of case of murder for which the maximum penalty is prescribed (see Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292; 164 A Crim R 126).  
     
      
    33 The offence of murder is however an offence to which a standard non-parole period of 20 years is prescribed pursuant to the provisions of Div 1A of Part 4 of the Sentencing Act.  
     
      
    34 As interpreted by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of its type after trial. In Way the Court also held that the assessment of objective seriousness is to be made by reference to the circumstances in which the offence was committed and not the circumstances of the offender, other than those causally connected to the commission of the offence. In Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290 at [50] Simpson J quoted the following extract from Way’s case to make clear the distinction: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""86 Some of the relevant circumstances which can be said 'objectively' to affect the 'seriousness' of the offence will be personal to the offender at the time of the offence but become relevant because of their causal connection with its commission. This would extend to matters of motivation (for example duress, provocation, robbery to feed a drug addiction),  
        mental state (for example, intention is more serious than recklessness 
        ), and  
        mental illness 
        , or intellectual disability,  
        where that is causally related to the commission of the offence 
        , in so far as the offender's capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise appropriate powers of control has been affected ..."" (italics added) 
        
       
      
    35 On the offender’s behalf it was conceded that of the three alternate states of mind that constitute the offence of murder, an intention to kill is a consideration tending to greater objective seriousness. It was then submitted that even were I to find that the offender intended to kill the deceased I should nevertheless be satisfied that the offence was less than mid range because I could not be satisfied that the killing was premeditated. The case of R v Nguyen [2007] NSWCCA 363; 180 A Crim R 267 was cited in support of that proposition. In that case Smart AJ was satisfied that the primary sentencing judge had erred in holding that the murder for which the appellant was sentenced was substantially above the mid range in objective seriousness. The deceased was killed when four men entered a billiard hall in Cabramatta armed with pistols and a samurai sword. The first man pointed at or in the direction of one of the patrons and then fired the pistol at close range. Another of the patrons was shot fatally in the chest and another wounded in the upper body. The primary judge was satisfied that the actions of the gunman left no room for doubt that his intention was to kill and that his actions were premeditated, irrespective of who was the intended victim. Although Smart JA was of the view that an intention to kill and premeditation are usual elements in a murder of mid range objective seriousness, and that there was nothing in the surrounding circumstances of that case that placed the offending above the mid range despite the grave nature of the killing, I do not understand his Honour to have intended to specify an intention to kill and premeditation as requisite elements of mid range offending generally. 
     
      
    Is the offence within the mid range? 
     
      
    36 Despite the fact that I am satisfied that the offender only formed the intention to kill the deceased when he decided to manoeuvre the car at and over the upper body of the deceased, the fact that he used the vehicle at that time with deliberation and determination, coupled with the fact that he must be taken to have known that the deceased was vulnerable and unable to defend himself, is sufficient, in my view, to characterise the offending as within the mid range. I am conscious in so finding that I am required to hypothesise as to what an abstract offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for an offence of this kind would be. Although I am satisfied that there was no premeditation or planning involved, and that the probabilities favour a finding that the offender’s decision to drive over the deceased was impulsive and reactive to the circumstances in which he came upon the deceased and Mr Newbold, I am satisfied that this offence nevertheless falls within the mid range. His conduct and behaviour after the deceased was killed confirm my view that having formed the intention to kill he did so with a cold and calculated detachment and not as a result of loss of self control.  
     
      
    37 Furthermore, I am not satisfied that there is anything personal to this offender that would, in any relevant sense, reduce the offending to less than mid range. In particular, to the extent that the offender ran and got his car in a state of fury because he had been attacked by Tony Matthews (which in the absence of any evidence from the offender I can only surmise as a possibility) I am not satisfied that this is connected in any causal sense to killing the deceased. Furthermore, in the absence of any evidence from the offender it would be a matter of mere speculation on my part that he may have thought the man on the ground was Tony Matthews. Of course, were this the case, it does nothing at all to change the objective seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    38 As this Court has emphasised on many occasions the use of a vehicle as a weapon is an offence of the gravest kind.39 In that connection, the following observation of Street CJ in Murnin v R (Court of Criminal Appeal, 16 August 1985, unreported) remains pertinent:  
     
      
       
        
        “A motor vehicle is a potentially dangerous - indeed lethal - machine. Those who drive motor vehicles on public highways, as do the overwhelming majority of members of our community, must inevitably accept that if they drive those potentially lethal machines dangerously and occasion death or grievous bodily harm, then the criminal law will exact from them a penalty appropriate to the degree of criminality which the whole of the circumstances disclose. The Legislature has always placed a premium upon human life and the taking of a human life by driving a vehicle dangerously is by virtue of this particular section to be regarded as a crime of some seriousness.” 
        
       
      
    40 These observations have been reaffirmed in this Court many times. As Sully J observed in R v Hall [2001] NSWCCA 202 at [66]: 
     
      
       
        
        “When…the crime to be punished is not the crime of dangerous driving causing death, but the crime of murder where the murder weapon is a motor vehicle, then the foregoing statements of principle are strengthened even further, and must be applied accordingly by a primary sentencing Judge.” 
        
       
      
    41 His Honour also observed that the use of a motor vehicle as a weapon is all too frequently committed by young offenders with previously good character, and, accordingly, that general deterrence is a paramount consideration in framing an appropriate sentence.  
     
      
    42 Since I am satisfied that the offence is within the mid range of offending of its type, I am required by s 54B(2) of the Sentencing Act to impose the standard non-parole period of 20 years unless I am satisfied, by reference to s 21A of the Sentencing Act, that there are reasons for departing from it.  
     
      
    Are there reasons for departing from the imposition of the standard non-parole period? 
     
      
    43 It was submitted on the offender’s behalf that various mitigating features, in combination, justified a departure from the standard non-parole period. It is said that he has good prospects of rehabilitation given his age, that he was of prior good character and that the nature of the offence and the circumstances in which it was committed make it unlikely that he will reoffend. I am not satisfied on the evidence before me that these matters, either individually or in combination, operate to mitigate the objective seriousness of the offending.  
     
      
    44 The material tendered on the offender’s behalf consisted of a report from Dr Andrew Walker, a senior staff specialist in forensic psychiatry with the Hunter Mental Health Service, a Probation and Parole Service pre-sentence report and testimonials from the offender’s friends and family. 45 The pre-sentence report and Dr Walker’s report were not, however, prepared for the purpose of this sentence proceeding but for proceedings in the Local Court on 17 May 2007. On that day the offender was placed on a bond to be of good behaviour for 2 years, and ordered to pay a fine of $200, after pleading guilty to assault police, resist arrest, entering a vehicle without permission and possessing/making an explosive without lawful purpose. Those offences were committed in Muswellbrook on 1 January 2007. I have been provided with the facts relied upon by the prosecution in the Local Court sentence proceedings. I accept that the offender’s conduct on that occasion was marked by irrationality. I also note that the charge of possessing/making an explosive related to a device the offender had constructed apparently as some protection against his car being stolen. 46 The offender informed the Probation and Parole officer that he had a chronic drug addiction and that he had taken many different drugs on the day he was arrested in January 2007. Dr Walker diagnosed a behavioural disorder associated with the use of a range of psychoactive substances. The offender informed him that that he been using drugs of various kinds on a daily basis since he was a teenager and regularly consumed large quantities of alcohol. He informed Dr Walker that he was a regular user of amphetamines and LSD. There is, however, no evidence before me that points to the offender being under the influence of either drugs or alcohol when he killed the deceased, or that his behavioural disorder is relevant to his offending in any causative sense. His counsel did not invite me to make such a finding. The pre-sentence report and the report from Dr Walker were tendered in order that I might have some appreciation of the circumstances of the prior offending and some biographical information. A pre-sentence report was not sought for the purposes of the current proceedings. 47 The letters from his family and friends were specific to these sentence proceedings. Quite apart from the fact that they do not mention his drug problem, there is considerable conflict across the body of the material as to the extent to which the offender has a family relationship of any depth. This raises questions as to the reliability of their assessment and insights into his character. 48 The offender’s parents separated when he was an infant. He initially resided with his mother in New South Wales but his father eventually gained custody of the offender and his siblings when he was seven years of age. He lived with his father until aged 14 when he was expelled from school. He told the Probation and Parole officer that he lived with his father for a short period of time after leaving school and that since that time, and despite his father’s offers of support, he remained detached both from him and other family members. By the age of 16 he was living alone. He said that over the last three years he had little contact with his family members. He informed Dr Walker that he was in a relationship of ten months duration as at February 2007 - a relationship that appeared from the evidence at the trial to be current at the time of the offending. There is no evidence before me that the relationship is a continuing one. 49 By contrast with the offender’s account to the authors of the reports, his older brother claims to have had a close relationship with him until he was taken into custody in July 2007 and that after the offender moved to Muswellbrook twelve months before the offence, he reported enjoying his life and making new friends. His brother also reported that everyone in the family, inclusive of his father and his older sister, are having difficulty accepting that the offender has been found guilty of murder and that this has been felt most extremely by his father whose health has rapidly declined over the last twelve months such that he has been unable to travel to Sydney either by aeroplane or car. He is fearful he may never see his son again. The offender’s stepsister also speaks of a shared and happy childhood with the offender, inclusive of a period in recent years when they lived together, and that the offender expressed continuing love and concern for her and her young daughter.  
     
      
    50 Whether the offender’s motives in understating his family connections to the Probation and Parole officer and Dr Walker were to protect them from learning of his drug use or his offending at that time, or for some other reason, on balance, and for the purposes of these proceedings, I accept that the views of his family members are genuinely held and that he has the love and support of his friends and family.  
     
      
    51 Each of the people who have provided a testimonial speak of the offender’s conduct as being entirely out of character. His brother observes that whilst the offender may have what he described as a “rough exterior” he is nevertheless a quiet, peaceful and compassionate person often defending people who are experiencing difficulties in their lives. On any view this is in stark contrast to the offender’s behaviour on 21 July 2007 both before, at the time of, and after he killed the deceased. Rehabilitation52 Because the offender has not acknowledged his guilt and has not given any explanation for his conduct or his motivations, or made known his attitude to his offending and the loss of life that resulted, I have only a very limited basis upon which to make any assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation. I have been invited by his counsel to find his prospects are good by reason of his youth, his relatively minor criminal history, his history of employment and his family support. The fact that he is currently 26 years of age, and that he has been gainfully employed in the motor vehicle trade in various capacities since leaving high school, does not, in my view, advance his case on sentence any material distance having regard to the objective gravity of the offending and his determination to take no public responsibility for his actions. While I accept he has family support and that he came to adverse notice for the first time six months prior to the murder, I am unable, in the absence of any insight into the attitude of the offender, to make any meaningful assessment of his prospects of rehabilitation. Likelihood of reoffending 
     
      
    53 While the particular circumstances that culminated in the death of the deceased are unlikely to present again, and while it is to be hoped that the offender would not resort to the means he chose in this case to settle a score or exact a revenge (if that was in fact his motivation in acting as he did) again, on the evidence available to me, I am unable to be satisfied on the probabilities that he is unlikely to reoffend against the criminal law.  
     
      
    Good character 
     
      
    54 Finally, whilst I accept that his friends and family members speak well of him, and while I am prepared to accept that there are aspects of this offender’s personality that may well endear him to others, his admitted polydrug use over many years and his very recent prior offending run counter to a finding that he is a person of prior unblemished character. That said, I do not regard his criminal antecedents or his drug use as features of aggravation. Although he committed this offence whilst he was subject to a bond to be of good behaviour, I am not persuaded that it aggravates the offending. None of the other aggravating factors under s 21A(2) are present since they are accounted for in the assessment I have made of objective seriousness. 55 I have been referred to a number of decisions where sentences of varying lengths have been imposed on offenders who have used a vehicle as a weapon where a death was occasioned. While there is some similarity in the objective circumstances, in each case the sentence was passed prior to the introduction of Div 1A of Part 4 of the Sentencing Act providing for the imposition of the standard non-parole period of 20 years for the offence of murder. In the case of R v Hall [2001] NSCWCCA 202 the Court of Criminal Appeal confirmed a sentence of 19 years and 6 months, with a non-parole period of 14 years and 6 months, in circumstances where, following a violent exchange with some people in the vicinity of an inner city hotel, the offender drove away before returning and intentionally driving at two people, knocking them to the ground and seriously injuring them. He then drove off a second time and returned striking several other people and killing one of them. The Court was satisfied that the offender drove with a deliberate and cold-blooded determination to exact revenge upon those who had, in his perception, grievously offended him. Despite the fact that the offender was only 22 years of age and that he was seriously intoxicated, angry and in all likelihood humiliated by having been beaten in a fight which he had himself in large part instigated, overall the offender’s behaviour was described as a dreadful criminal enterprise and the sentence imposed was not regarded as excessive. 
     
      
    56 In R v Holton [2004] NSWCCA 214, a sentence of 16 years with a non-parole period of 12 years was imposed when the offender, after being involved in a police chase driving a stolen motor vehicle, deliberately ran at and over a police officer who was attempting to stop the vehicle by use of spikes on a roadway. In that case the element of reckless indifference to human life was relied upon at trial by the Crown as justifying the charge of murder. The Crown’s appeal against the leniency of the sentence was dismissed with the Court observing that whilst the sentence was lenient it was not so low as to warrant the Court’s intervention. That offender was 25 years of age with a minor criminal record. 
     
      
    57 As I have emphasised, in neither case was the sentencing judge constrained by the fact that the offence was subject to a standard non-parole period. Accordingly, and despite the similarities in the cases to which I have been referred, similarities which in other circumstances might be productive of a sentence of similar length, this offender must be sentenced strictly in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Sentencing Act. I am not persuaded that there are factors that mitigate the offending and, accordingly, the standard non-parole period of 20 years will be imposed.58 Before I impose sentence it is important that I acknowledge that I have received in evidence a victim impact statement from the deceased’s grandfather, Mr Leslie Gleeson, which was read onto the record by Ms Denise Day on his behalf. As Mr Gleeson senior is aware, I have not received that statement for the purpose of increasing the sentence to be imposed on this offender but to allow him, and through him, his family, the opportunity to participate in the sentence proceedings by publicly expressing their grief and making me aware of its impact on them. I well appreciate the difficulty that Mr Gleeson has experienced in coming to terms with the death of a very close and young family member in circumstances where his death was both pointless, unexpected and attendant with such a callous disregard for his life. Mr Gleeson speaks of his grandson in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Lukas was a typical young bloke, a real character. He loved his family and his mates. He loved having a laugh, sharing a beer and playing his guitar. He talked about setting out on his own – saving for a flat and owning his car. He was looking forward to his 23rd birthday. Everything was coming together for him. He had so many hopes and dreams – now shattered in such a senseless and violent way…” 
        
       
      
    59 I take pause and acknowledge the central part the deceased played in the life of his grandfather and how he feels the loss of his grandson on a daily basis, with no lessening of sadness over the passing of time. I take this opportunity to extend my personal sympathies to Mr Gleeson, his extended family members and friends.  
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    60 I sentence the offender to a non-parole period of 20 years to commence on 21 July 2007 and to expire on 20 July 2027. I impose a balance of term of 6 years and 8 months. In light of the length of the non-parole period it is not necessary to make an adjustment for special circumstances.

     JUDGMENT 
    1 Mrs Yvonne Marie Elliot fell as she left the Cardiff Panthers Club at about 6:30 pm on 4 September 2004. She fractured both of her wrists. She claimed that her fall was the result of negligence on the part of Penrith Rugby League Club Limited, the operator of the club premises.2 The negligence complained of was that the car parking area in which she fell was inadequately lit and that the defendant’s system of cleaning and maintenance was inadequate to remove accumulations of twigs or sticks that caused her to fall.The circumstances of the plaintiff's fall3 The plaintiff attended the club on Saturday, 4 September 2004 with her son Benjamin and her daughter Kristie. They had lunch and stayed at the club until about 6:30 pm. The plaintiff did not drink alcohol. Ms Elliot left five minutes earlier than the plaintiff and Mr Elliot.4 They left through what appeared to be a rear entrance to the club adjoining its car park. The car park was covered in asphalt. The plaintiff said that this was the first occasion on which she had left the club through this entrance after dark. There were at the time no lane markings to guide pedestrians through the car park.5 The plaintiff said she felt her feet move on something as if they were on a roller and she fell forwards onto her hands and knees. The plaintiff estimated that she was about 4.6 metres from the door through which she exited the club when she fell.LIABILITYLighting6 The plaintiff said there was no lighting in the car park and she could not see the ground ahead of her. Mr Elliot was walking in front of her and she was able to see the silhouettes of persons who were walking towards her. She concentrated on staying out of their way. 7 After her fall Mr Elliot assisted her to a brick wall where she sat while she was treated by a club employee, Mrs Sharon McDonald, trained in first aid. According to the plaintiff, Mrs McDonald, while filling out an incident report form said she could barely see. Benjamin bought his car to a spot in the car park so that his headlights could provide some illumination.8 Mr Elliot supported the plaintiff's evidence that it was dark in the car park at the time of her fall. He said visibility was very poor. He said after the fall he looked back and noticed there were two flood lights on the club building that were not turned on. He said he had used that entrance to the club on previous occasions and it was normally well lit.9 He said the Mrs McDonald used a pad that she moved around and tilted towards the light. She leaned towards his headlights when he drove up his car so that it was parked directly in front of the plaintiff.10 Mr Elliot rejected the proposition that, even without the floodlights, there was sufficient illumination of the car park provided by interior lighting of the club and lights on bollards situated just outside the entrance.11 Mr Rodney Edwards was one of the persons seen by the plaintiff to be walking towards her just before her fall. He passed her before she fell but, hearing the noise of her fall, he turned to assist her afterwards.12 Mr Edwards said that apart from light in the glazed foyer of the club it was very dark. He said he knew Mr Elliot from school but did not recognise him initially because it was too dark. He remembered that there was a light above the sliding doors at the entrance but said there was otherwise very little illumination.13 Ms Elliot said that when she left the car park five minutes earlier than plaintiff it was very dark. She had used the car park on previous occasions and said that on those occasions the car park was clearly lit with good visibility.14 Mrs McDonald said she provided first aid to the plaintiff and completed the incident report form. When she left the club to provide assistance to the plaintiff the lighting was fine. Had there been a problem with the lighting, she would have noted it in the incident report.15 Mrs McDonald acknowledged that Mr Elliot told her that the lighting was not good. She did not recall whether she used the headlights from Mr Elliot's car to assist in completing the incident report form. She agreed that the level of lighting in the car park was not the same as it would have been inside the club.16 Mrs McDonald agreed that work had been carried out on the car park since the time of the plaintiff's fall. The work included the provision of line markings in the car park to direct pedestrians to the areas in which they should walk, the installation of bollards with lights and the provision of additional lights on the top of the building.17 Mr Robert Henry was the team leader of maintenance staff at the club at the time of the plaintiff's fall. He described lighting in the foyer of the club that extended one to two metres from the entrance. There were also two floodlights on the side of the building. They operated on a photo electric cell so that they switched on at sunset. The sensor was placed on the roof of the club.18 Mr Henry said that at most one light would be inoperative at night either because a globe failed or because of vandalism. When he received a report that a globe was not operating he called in an electrical contractor to attend to the necessary repair.19 A certificate issued by Geoscience Australia stated that on 4 September 2004 the sun set at 17.38 pm, civil twilight occurred at 18.03 pm and nautical twilight occurrent at 18.31 pm. The certificate described nautical twilight as the point at which, in the absence of moonlight, artificial lighting or adverse atmospheric conditions, it is dark for normal practical purposes. 20 A report prepared by Dr Watson at the defendant’s request was unhelpful because it dealt with a lighting system that was upgraded after the plaintiff’s accident and with lighting levels when all the lights were operating. It was agreed by Mr Adams who prepared a report at the plaintiff’s request that, when operating fully, the lights at the club provided adequate illumination.The condition of the car park21 The plaintiff said that she looked back at the point where she fell when she was sitting on the wall and noticed that there were some branches on the ground in that area. She described the branches as 2 feet in length with a thickness of the size of a 20 cent piece. It was her case that these branches were the cause of her fall. In cross-examination she agreed that these objects could be described as twigs although they were probably bigger.22 Mr Elliot said that after the plaintiff fell he knelt on the ground to assist her and whilst there he noticed material at her feet that looked like small twigs and sticks, 8 to 10 inches long.23 Mr Edwards said that, with Mr Elliot, he looked around the surface of the car park after the plaintiff fell in a search of the cause of her fall. He said he saw an indentation in the ground in the area where she fell.24 Mrs McDonald said she walked with Mr Elliot to the point where he said the plaintiff fell. She saw one or two small sticks, twig sized, on the ground. She said she saw nothing else. 25 In the incident report Mrs McDonald wrote, referring to the plaintiff: 
     
      
      She stated the lighting was fairly poor and also there was a couple of sticks (small) lying where she fell. 
      
    In a subsequent typewritten report Mrs McDonald wrote, referring to Mr Elliot: 
     
      
      Her son mentioned that he thought the lighting was bad and also there was a couple of sticks on the ground that she may have tripped on but when I asked Mrs Elliott about the sticks she said she just did not know. 
      
    26 Mrs McDonald maintained in the course of her evidence to the court that the plaintiff told her that she did not know what caused her to fall. This was denied by the plaintiff.27 Mr Henry stated that the car park was cleaned by services staff of the club first thing every morning. The staff picked up rubbish and swept the car park. Any rubbish that accumulated during the course of the day remained until the car park was cleaned the following morning.28 Mr Adams reported that he took into account obstacles in the car park that included: a pothole of significant size; a drain and some associated unevenness of the surface; loose gravel; and, sticks and twigs of types and sizes that could either catch the toe of a shoe, or roll beneath the sole of a shoe. 29 In the absence of evidence from the plaintiff to suggest that the fall was the result of unevenness in the surface of the car park, I have disregarded Mr Adams’ comments on this aspect. Similarly there was no evidence that there was loose gravel in the area where she fell.30 Mr Adams dealt with the presence of twigs as follows: 
     
      
      Considering the fact that Mrs Elliott fell forwards it is most likely that she stumbled forwards after experiencing … a slip at the phase of walking referred to as “ toe off” (ie. With the foot from which she was stepping off slipping backwards when only the sole of the foot, as opposed to her heel, was in contact with the surface). The presence of an unobserved round twig or branch beneath the front section of her foot could certainly have resulted in a backwards slip of that foot. 
      
    31 Mr Adams concluded that without adequate lighting the plaintiff was unable to perceive potential obstacles to safe movement within the car park. He suggested that the defendant failed to implement a hazard identification and risk assessment process and the need to address risks identified by the provision of adequate lighting and regular sweeping to remove temporary hazards such as sticks, twigs and branches.Findings32 The Geoscience Australia certificate established that at 6:30 pm on 4 September 2004 it was dark at Cardiff. 33 It was agreed that the lighting was adequate when such illumination as was provided was operational.34 The lighting system operated automatically. There was no evidence that the system provided a warning when it failed to operate or that any system was in place to check that the lights in fact operated at the programmed times. Mr Henry reacted to reports of malfunction.35 All witnesses, except Mrs McDonald, described the lighting as poor. An immediate complaint of poor lighting by the plaintiff and Mr Elliot was recorded by Mrs McDonald.36 The witnesses included Mr Edwards who was apparently independent although he acknowledged a casual acquaintanceship with Mr Elliot. I found no reason to reject his evidence.37 I find that the lighting was inadequate for the dark conditions prevailing at the time of the plaintiff's fall. I find that the reason for this inadequacy was that the external lighting for the car park was not operating at the time of the plaintiff's fall.38 Mr Edwards said nothing about the presence of twigs, sticks, branches or any other accumulations of material likely to cause the temporary hazards referred to by Mr Adams.39 Mr Elliott and Mrs McDonald described the material they noticed on the ground as small twigs or sticks. Their evidence indicated that the plaintiff's description of branches of considerable size was overstated.40 It was not disputed by the defendant that the absence of lighting created a foreseeable risk of harm. The defendant argued that the system of providing two floodlights which operated automatically on a photo electric cell, maintained when malfunction was reported, was reasonable. It was suggested that this was a one off incident and that it remained undetected for only about 45 minutes between sunset when the floodlights were set to operate and the time of the plaintiff's fall.41 I do not accept that a system that depended upon the casual reporting of a malfunction was reasonable in the circumstances of pedestrian use of a large car park servicing in a major social club. There was no evidence that the system itself automatically alerted club staff to a malfunction or that any staff member was given responsibility to check the operation of external lights that functioned automatically.42 I have concluded that a reasonable response to the foreseeable risk of harm would have been to provide a system of ensuring that the external lights that operated by means of an automatic system were in fact functioning by the time it was dark.43 Had I been satisfied that the lights were functioning I would not have regarded the presence of small twigs or sticks on the surface of the car park as a significant hazard against which a more reasonable response from the defendant was required. The car park was cleaned daily. I do not accept that a more frequent system of sweeping or inspection would necessarily guarantee the absence of such materials within the car park.44 In ordinary circumstances, however, when the car park was properly lit those materials would have been visible and avoidable by club patrons.45 I find the defendant in breach of its duty of care to the plaintiff in failing to provide adequate lighting for the car parking area over which she was walking at the time of her fall.DAMAGESNon economic loss46 After her fall the plaintiff was taken home and then to Belmont Hospital where x-rays revealed the fractures to her wrists. She was referred to Dr Kemp who admitted to her to Lingard Private Hospital on 10 September 2004 for bilateral open reduction, fixation and reconstruction of the wrists involving the use of plates and locking screws. The nature of the surgery involved indicated that the fractures were of considerable severity.47 The plaintiff was discharged five days later with casts and fibreglass splints that remained in place until January 2005. Physiotherapy was provided for six months after surgery.48 By the end of 2005 Dr Kemp reported that he was optimistic that the plaintiff's long-term result would be excellent. He reported to her general practitioner that she had full range of movement and good strength in her wrists with some burning discomfort in both wrists and irritability in the joints of the right wrist. Dr Kemp suggested that consideration be given to removing the plates at some future date.49 The plaintiff complained that she has not achieved the long-term excellent result anticipated by Dr Kemp. She has not consulted him on the question of whether removal of the plates is by now warranted and whether this might relieve her ongoing discomfort.50 The plaintiff complained of constant aching pain in both thumbs and wrists, aggravated by activity, and lack of strength in her wrists. She stated that these problems affected her activities significantly.51 Prior to the accident she engaged in crafts such as beading, arts, crochet, knitting and card making. She now does little of this work although she is attempting to crochet in order to increase the range of movement in her hands. The plaintiff complained of problems with her handwriting. At times she uses splints on her wrists to relieve discomfort when driving. 52 The plaintiff had a pre-accident history of psychiatric illness involving depression, anxiety attacks and agoraphobia. She claimed that the symptoms of her illness were aggravated by the accident and the consequences of her continuing wrist discomfort. She said she was frustrated by the limits placed on her activities so that the level of depression increased, she lost confidence and her symptoms and agoraphobia are now more severe.Attendant and Domestic Care53 The plaintiff stated that she needed considerable attendant and domestic care after surgery and the defendant did not dispute the validity of this part of the plaintiff's claim up to March 2005.54 The plaintiff claimed however that her condition generated a continuing need for considerable assistance on a voluntary basis in the past and for which she will obtain assistance on a commercial basis in the future if funds are available.55 The plaintiff said that between 2005 and 2007 she continued to obtain help in preparing food because she could not, for instance, cut vegetables or lift pots. She could not lift heavy shopping. She could not use a standard can opener or hang out heavy items of washing. She could not do heavy housework.56 The plaintiff also claimed she continued to need assistance with matters of personal hygiene such as shaving her legs, pedicures and closing her bra.57 In January 2007 the plaintiff was diagnosed with bowel cancer. After surgery in March 2007 and until August 2007 she was fitted with a colostomy bag that required regular cleaning and changing. The plaintiff said she had a number of accidents attending to this task because of the lack of dexterity in her hands. She was embarrassed by the need to involve Ms Elliott in this task.58 The plaintiff acknowledged that prior to the accident she had been limited in the extent to which she was able to do heavy housework. This was because of a back injury that, after many years, resulted in surgery for excision of the L5/S1 disc in 1988. The plaintiff suffered injury to her neck in a motor vehicle accident in 1981. Medical evidence indicated that the plaintiff continued to have symptoms of some severity as a result of these injuries up to September 2004 and that by that date she had also developed thoracic pain.59 Ms Elliott gave evidence that she provided considerable assistance to the plaintiff in the period of three months after her surgery. She said she continued to assist her for between two to five hours daily up until the time of the diagnosis of her cancer. She confirmed that she had assisted the plaintiff with the colostomy bag. She stated that she was currently providing help for between four and five hours a week.60 In addition it was claimed that assistance was provided by the plaintiff's estranged husband.61 Ms Elliott said that the work of that she undertook included vacuum cleaning, mopping and sweeping and cleaning the bathroom. Tested, she agreed that she had done some of this work prior to the accident but said that she was now doing more. She also agreed that she had assisted the plaintiff with pedicures prior to her fall. The tasks that she rarely or never carried out prior to the fall included cooking, lifting heavy pots and pans, laundry and mopping or sweeping the kitchen floor.Assessment62 The defendant took issue with the plaintiff's complaints of significant ongoing pain and disability. It alleged that the plaintiff had overstated both the extent of her injuries and their consequences to her ability to undertake activity. Further it was claimed that her limitations predated her fall to a considerable extent.63 Dr Beiers, examining the plaintiff in March 2007, recorded findings of decreased range of motion and weakness in both wrists which limited the plaintiff's capacity to do fine motor tasks and those involving grip strength. She said the prognosis for improvement was limited.64 Dr Beiers provided an assessment of the plaintiff's needs for domestic assistance totalling six hours a week. She made no reference in her report to the plaintiff's pre-accident needs for assistance because she had not been provided with a history of prior back injury. Dr Beiers in a subsequent report made it clear that her estimate was based upon her understanding that the plaintiff coped with her house work prior to the fall.65 Similarly Ms Walker assessed the plaintiff's needs on the basis that she had been fully capable and solely responsible for maintaining her home. She was informed of back and neck injuries as a result of which the plaintiff paced herself with her housework including vacuum cleaning and other heavy tasks. Ms Walker on that basis provided an opinion supporting a claim for a significant degree of assistance past and future.66 Dr Wallace examined the plaintiff in March 2008. He noted some limited restrictions in the range of movement of the plaintiff's wrists and the plaintiff's complaints of ongoing pain. In his opinion the plaintiff required an ongoing home exercise program and intermittent use of simple analgesic medication. Dr Wallace similarly was not informed of the plaintiff's pre-accident requirement for domestic assistance and his assessment of her care was similarly affected.67 The plaintiff received some counselling and the report of Dr Kennedy, psychologist, did establish that there was a period during which she suffered an aggravation of her pre-existing psychiatric conditions as a result of the wrist injuries. Dr Vickery who examined the plaintiff more recently was of the opinion that the plaintiff's psychiatric health was no longer affected by her wrist injuries.68 The defendant tendered in evidence a DVD that recorded episodes of surveillance of the plaintiff in September 2008. The defendant claimed that this recording supported its contention that she overstated her condition. The content of the DVD did not, in my view, advance this contention. It showed the plaintiff undertaking a number of activities. 69 One episode, recorded through the net curtains of her kitchen window, showed the plaintiff moving around in her kitchen. The plaintiff agreed that at the time she was preparing food for herself and her husband. She said she was putting food on a bun. It was not possible to see from the recording precisely what the plaintiff did with her hands throughout this period of surveillance.70 In another episode the plaintiff was seen using a light weight broom with her right hand for a matter of a few seconds. The third episode recorded the plaintiff at a supermarket carrying a plastic basket with the handle over her right arm. A package of toilet rolls or paper towels was tucked under her right arm and she carried a package in her left arm. The plaintiff denied absolutely that this package contained 12 x 600 ml bottles of soft drink and it was obvious from the way in which she was carrying the package that it was not of significant weight.71 I have therefore attached little significance to the evidence on the DVD. I was satisfied however that the plaintiff attempted to overstate her condition and the needs for assistance that it generated.72 The evidence of Dr Beiers and Dr Wallace did establish that the plaintiff continued to suffer some restriction in the range of movement of her wrists although they recorded different levels of restriction. Having regard to my finding of over statement by the plaintiff and noting that Dr Wallace's examination of her was at a more recent date, I prefer his opinions to those of Dr Beiers.73 The result is that I find that the plaintiff suffered serious bilateral wrist fractures with ongoing moderate levels of pain and discomfort and restriction in the range of movement.74 I find that this affected her capacity for much of her leisure activity and that during her recovery period it caused an aggravation of her pre-existing psychiatric condition. In the absence of any psychiatric opinion to the contrary, I accept the opinion of Dr Vickery that the plaintiff's injuries were no longer having an aggravating effect.75 In assessing the plaintiff's claims for compensation it is also necessary to take into account the effect on her life expectancy by reason of the bowel cancer for which she was treated in 2007. There was no evidence that the cancer has recurred to date. The plaintiff's treating surgeon and Dr Page, oncologist, agreed that there is a prospect that the cancer will recur and that the plaintiff's life expectancy has therefore been affected. Dr Page quantified the loss by stating that the plaintiff's normal life expectancy has been reduced by 12 years.76 Taking this into account and having regard to the plaintiff's pain and suffering following injury with gradual recovery both physically and psychiatrically to her present condition as already described I have assessed her non economic loss at 26% of the maximum sum. I have allowed her the sum of $36,000.77 I accept that the plaintiff required considerable assistance in the period when both of her arms were splinted and plastered and to a diminishing extent thereafter. Having regard to Dr Wallace's opinion I have accepted that it would be appropriate to award the plaintiff compensation for voluntary care provided at significant levels for a period of seven months.78 I find that Ms Walker's estimate was overstated but, having regard to evidence supporting the plaintiff's claim of total dependency for a considerable part of that period, I consider it reasonable to allow an average of 35 hours for 30 weeks at a rate of $20 per hour. I have awarded the plaintiff $21,000 for this period.79 Thereafter, the evidence indicated that there was a pre-existing need for domestic assistance that was not generated by the injuries suffered in this accident. As a result I have not been satisfied that the requirement for assistance related solely to these injuries amounted to the minimum six hours per week and no allowance has been made.80 The claim for future care is allowed to provide paid assistance for three hours per week to permit the plaintiff to secure some personal care and assistance with food preparation, cooking and grocery shopping.81 At the rate quoted by Ms Walker of $24.67 per hour and reducing the plaintiff's life expectancy by 12 years I have allowed the plaintiff the sum of $47,825.Out of Pocket Expenses82 Past out of pocket expenses are agreed in the sum of $2,335.50.83 For the future the plaintiff claimed sums to provide for anti-depressant and pain relieving medication. It was apparent from the evidence that the plaintiff's future need for anti-depressant medication was not related to this injury. In addition the plaintiff agreed that she relied on pain killing medication to deal with her pre-accident back and neck pain and that her requirement for medication has been increased by the wrist injuries.84 Her claim for future medical expenses is therefore allowed at one third of the cost of pain relieving medication allowing $5.50 per week, again with the appropriate reduction of her life expectancy. The sum allowed is $3,554.85 The plaintiff claimed a significant number of items of equipment on the recommendation of Ms Walker. Her total claim was $7,773. It was readily apparent that some of these items would assist the plaintiff. It was also apparent that some of the items provided for by Ms Walker were based upon overstatement by the plaintiff of her condition and others related to the need to assist the plaintiff with household tasks that she did not undertake prior to the accident. 86 Taking these features into account together with the plaintiff's reduced life expectancy I have awarded one half of the amount claimed in the sum of $3886.50.Summary87 Compensation is awarded on the following heads of damage as follows: 
     
      
      Non economic loss $36,000 
       
      Past care $21,000 
       
      Future care $47,825 
       
      Past Out of Pocket Expenses $2,335.50 
       
      Future out of pocket expenses $3,554 
       
      Equipment needs $3,886.50 
      
     
     
      
      TOTAL 
       $114,601.00 
      
    ORDERS88 Verdict and judgment for the plaintiff in the sum of $114,601.00.89 The defendant is to pay the plaintiff’s costs of the proceedings. This order is suspended for seven days to allow the parties to list the matter for further argument, if required.90 The exhibits will be retained for 28 days.91 My reasons are published.

    3 PRICE J: This is an appeal by Lam Quach against his conviction on 28 August 2007 after a jury trial in the District Court of a charge that on 14 May 2005 he did maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm on Richard Mills with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900. He had been further charged in the alternative that on 14 May 2005 he did maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm upon Richard Mills contrary to s 35 of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    4 The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 8 February 2008 and expiring on 7 February 2010 with a balance of term of 1 year commencing on the expiration of the non-parole period and expiring on 7 February 2011. The Judge directed that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention and that the appellant be released at the expiration of the non-parole period.  
     
      
       
       
       
       
      
    5 There are two grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The trial Judge erred in law by failing to adequately direct and distinguish for the jury the mental elements applicable to the offences of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent and maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm.  
        
       
      
      
     
      
       
        
        2.  
        The trial Judge erred by failing to direct the jury that merely finding beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who kicked the victim did not automatically mandate that the appellant was guilty of one or other of the offences charged.  
        
       
      
      A summary of the facts 6 On 14 May 2005 a soccer match was being played between the Dobroyd Lions and the Cabra-Vale Diggers at Algie Park Haberfield which was part of the Sydney Amateur Football League competition. The alleged victim Richard Mills volunteered to be one of the linesmen for the match. Mr Mills was a member of the Dobroyd Lions but was not playing that day. The appellant played for the Cabra-Vale team and was wearing a number 10 Jersey. 
     
      
    7 The match commenced at 3pm and was played without incident until about the 80th minute when a member of the Dobroyd team was fouled by a Cabra-Vale player. Both players fell to the ground. As both players got off the ground, the Dobroyd player pushed the Cabra-Vale player to the chest. Mr Mills said that he waved his flag for the foul and the referee blew his whistle simultaneously. There was some shouting and then the Cabra-Vale player pushed back at the Dobroyd player and a few other players joined in the argument.  
     
      
    8 It was the Crown case that Mr Mills stepped onto the soccer pitch to intervene. He dropped his flag before doing so. Mr Mills testified that he stepped onto the pitch because the situation may have been made worse by the additional players running over and he thought it needed to be defused. He put himself between the players with his arms outstretched pushing them both away from each other. The referee was still standing where he had blown the whistle. At this stage a player grabbed hold of Mr Mills’ shirt. It wasn’t, Mr Mills said, either of the men that he had his hands on. It was one of the men who had come over as the disagreement had broken out. He was standing directly in front of Mr Mills. At that point, the Cabra-Vale player who Mr Mills had his hands on was also pushing him and holding onto his shirt. Mr Mills gave evidence that the third person was of Asian appearance, about thirty years old, five foot ten tall, had shortish black hair and was of medium build. He did not see the number on the man’s shirt. He could recall more shouting and arguing and then a few other players were trying to break things up. That was his last memory. The next thing he remembered was one of the Dobroyd players putting a bag of ice over his nose. 
     
      
       
      Mr Mills was driven to Concord Hospital where he remained in the emergency ward until the early hours of the morning and was then discharged. On 15 May 2005 he saw a dentist for treatment in relation to the damage to his teeth. He returned to Concord Hospital on 16 May 2005 for further treatment. Mr Mills sustained a broken nose, a broken left cheek bone, a severed nerve to the area of his left cheek, a fractured left eye socket, a damaged right retina and a neck injury similar to whiplash. He also had two broken teeth and one bent backwards at a 90 degree angle. Root canal surgery was performed on the broken teeth and the third was crowned.  
       
      
    9 A large number of witnesses were called by the Crown. For the purposes of the appeal, it is unnecessary to refer to them all.  
     
      
    10 Sherif Desoukey, the match referee, testified that after the linesman ran onto the field, he saw the number 10 Cabra-Vale player throwing a motion of a kick. Mr Desoukey was about two or three yards away from him. There was no one around player number 10 when he did the kick. It wasn’t a violent kick. After that, player number 10 joined the commotion. He did not notice where the linesman was at that stage. Mr Desoukey said when the commotion stopped, he sent off the number 10 player from Cabra-Vale because in the rules of soccer a kick or attempted kick whether it connects or not is not allowed. In cross-examination he said that he saw only one kick by the number 10 Cabra-Vale player and that kick did not connect with anyone.  
     
      
    11 Naomi Golding, the linesperson, told the jury that she saw the club linesman enter the field of play and into the melee. She then lost sight of him and soon afterwards she heard someone say “look at his face”. She did see a foot in the air but could not say whether it connected with anything. The foot had a red soccer boot on it. She saw the red soccer boot in the same proximity as the linesman. The boot was at head height and went from left to right. In cross-examination Ms Golding agreed that she did not observe the precise event that caused the injury to the linesman nor could she identify the person who caused the injury.  
     
      
    12 Viet Tran Pham, one of the Cabra-Vale players, testified that he did not kick the linesman in the head and did not see anyone else kick him in the head. He had not told anyone that he did it. Mr Pham said that he was not wearing red football boots during the match. In cross-examination Mr Pham said he could not remember whether he went to soccer practice on the Thursday after the game. He denied that he admitted to the appellant that he was the person who kicked the linesman. He was shown an email sent to him by the appellant (exhibit 3). He agreed that he had taken the view that he had been falsely accused by the appellant of inflicting this injury. He said he was shocked and upset by this but he still considered the appellant to be a friend. He denied that he kicked the linesman.  
     
      
    13 Darren Roberts, a Dobroyd player, gave evidence that the linesman came onto the pitch and tried to break up the players by standing in between them with his arms outstretched and palms outwards. Mr Roberts then saw the linesman on the ground on all fours. A Cabra-Vale player ran in towards the linesman and kicked him flush in the face. The kick carried through until the Cabra-Vale player’s leg was horizontal. It was, Mr Roberts said about four feet off the ground. The number on the jersey of the Cabra-Vale player, Mr Roberts testified, who kicked the linesman was number 10. He said the player was about five foot five inches to five foot six inches tall with black hair and Asian appearance. The number 10 player from Cabra-Vale was sent off. Mr Roberts described the kick as being very powerful. 
     
      
    14 Jonathan Curry, who had been watching the game, testified that after Mr Mills walked onto the pitch, he pushed one of the Cabra-Vale players in the chest with both hands knocking him backwards. The player fell to the ground. Some of the Cabra-Vale players started wrestling with Mr Mills who ended up on the ground on his hands and knees. Mr Curry said that Mr Mills was kicked in the face by a Cabra-Vale player. The player ran towards Mr Mills and kicked him with his right foot. He described the person who kicked Mr Mills as five foot six or five foot eight tall and of Asian background. He had short black hair and had the number 10 on the back of his top. Richard Walters gave evidence of the linesman coming onto the field, trying to separate the players and defuse the situation. Mr Mills fell to the ground and appeared to be on all fours. Someone then kicked him in the face. This person was the number 10 player from the Cabra-Vale side.  
     
      
    15 Geoffrey Millar, a Dobroyd player, testified that Mr Mills was on his hands and knees when the number 10 player for the Cabra-Vale team ran towards him and kicked him in the face. It was a kick that followed through. Mr Millar said the boot of the kicker was a red Adidas boot. He recalled that the same player had scored a goal during the game. Daniel Fuller, a Dobroyd player, described Mr Mills being pushed to the ground. He then saw a guy running straight behind the person he was speaking to and he then heard a loud cracking noise. He saw one of the Cabra-Vale players stepping away but did not see the number on his top. The man had orangey-coloured hair and bright red football boots. This man was immediately surrounded by a lot of Cabra-Vale players. Mr Mills stumbled off the pitch with a Dobroyd player. In cross-examination, Mr Fuller said that he did not see any kick connect with Mr Mills.  
     
      
    16 Liam McDaid, a Dobroyd player, described Mr Mills being down on all fours facing the ground when the number 10 player from the Cabra-Vale team ran in and kicked him square in the face. The number 10 player was wearing red and white boots. Keith Quinn testified that Mr Mills had been pushed by an opposing player and was on all fours. The player that Mr Quinn had been marking then ran towards Mr Mills and kicked him with his right foot in the face. Stephen Taylor, secretary of the Dobroyd Point Soccer Club, gave evidence that the number 10 Cabra-Vale player came out of the pack and kicked Mr Mills in the face. He kicked him like he was kicking the soccer ball towards a shot at goal. He used his right foot and it was, he said, a very strong kick. 
     
      
    17 A dental surgeon, Dr Kenneth Wong, gave evidence of the dental injuries sustained by Mr Mills which included a tooth displaced lingually, that is, towards the back of the mouth, 1.5cm from its original position. He also had three fractured teeth. Dr Wong opined that the injuries suffered by Mr Mills would have been caused by heavy force from the front of the patient and the speed of the trauma would have had to have been great.  
     
      
    18 A set of Agreed Facts pursuant to s 191 of the Evidence Act 1995 became an exhibit. It was agreed that Mr Mills was treated by a plastic surgeon on 19 May 2005 and gave a history of being kicked in the face. He sustained a fracture of the left eye socket with a depressed left cheek bone, a fracture of the bones above the left upper teeth, a fracture of the bones the left eye sits on, associated teeth and retinal injuries, bruising on the right side of his face and a fracture of the nose. Mr Mills underwent surgery on 19 May 2005. The bones of his left face were repositioned and three metal plates were used to hold them in position. The injuries were consistent with and a typical consequence of a direct forceful blow to the mid-face and cheek. 
     
      
    19 The appellant gave evidence during which he said he did not kick any person while he was on the field nor did he intentionally kick at any person whether or not it connected. He accepted that he was the number 10 player for Cabra-Vale and had scored one goal that day. He said that he was wearing red soccer boots and to his recollection no one else had red boots. He said that he was called over by the referee, given a red card and sent off the field. He did not ask why he was being sent off as he never questioned referees or officials in a game. The appellant thought that he may have been sent off for blowing a kiss at the number 10 Dobroyd player as that was bad sportsmanship. The appellant then left the field, got changed and went home. The next day he received a phone call from the team captain who told him that someone had been hurt on the field. He asked “What does that have to do with me?” He was told “Dobroyd is blaming it on you.” After a conversation with the club secretary, he went to the Glebe Police Station as she had advised him to do. He was told that there was no incident regarding a soccer match according to their records. The appellant said that he attended training on the Thursday immediately after the match. During training Viet Pham approached him and said “I kicked the bloke”. The appellant did not respond. He identified the email sent by him to the club secretary and her response (Exhibit 1). He also identified an email sent by him to Viet Pham (exhibit 3) and his response.  
     
      
    20 Lyle Walsh, a spectator, gave evidence that the linesman was kicked in the face by one of the players from the Cabra-Vale side. He did not see the number of the player that did the kicking. That player was wearing black boots.  
     
      
    21 Two witnesses testified as to the appellant’s good character. The appellant did not have a prior criminal history.  
     
      
       
      Dealing with the appeal  
       
      
    Ground 1: The trial Judge erred in law by failing to adequately direct  
     
      
       
        
         
          
          and distinguish for the jury the mental elements applicable to the offences of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm with intent and maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm.  
           
          
         
        
       
      
    22 The appellant was charged on the indictment with a single count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm upon Mr Mills with intent to do grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act and in the alternative with a single count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to s 35(1)(b) of the Crimes Act. It was the appellant’s submission that the Judge’s directions to the jury were inadequate as they failed to distinguish between the mental elements of the count contrary to s 33 and the alternative count contrary to s 35.  
     
      
    23 In order to establish that the appellant was guilty of the more serious crime of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm with intent (the s 33 offence with a maximum penalty of 25 years), the Crown had to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant inflicted the injuries upon the victim with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm. For the alternative and lesser crime of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm (the s 35 offence with a maximum penalty of 7 years), the Crown had to establish that the appellant maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm. The meaning of the word ‘maliciously’ includes an intention to cause some physical injury: R v Stokes & Difford (1990) 51 A Crim R 25 per Hunt J at 40.  
     
      
    24 In his directions to the jury, the Judge said (SU 4): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Now, you have heard about the elements for an offence and I take it you have still got the copy of the indictment with you there, and I will come to that in a moment. But for a crime to have been committed, certain things will have to be done, and the law calls these the ingredients or the elements of the offence. So for you to find the accused guilty, the Crown has to prove each and every one of these ingredients or elements, and prove each and every one of them to your satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt.”  
        
       
      
    25 The Judge drew the jury’s attention to the two counts on the indictment and went on to say (SU 6): 
     
      
       
        
        “…The second charge does not say ‘with intent to do grievous bodily harm’. That is in the first charge.” 
        
       
      
    26 His Honour asked “what are the elements of these charges?” The jury was then instructed (SU 6): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        First of all, the word ‘maliciously’ certainly comes into play here. What is meant by the reference to ‘maliciously’? Well ‘maliciously’ includes every act done of malice, whether against an individual or others, or, if not malice, with indifference to human life or suffering, or with an intent to injure somebody. And it is without lawful excuse. If it is done recklessly or wantonly, that shall also be taken to have been done maliciously.”  
        
       
      
    27 The jury was told that “grievous bodily harm really means any bodily injury of a really serious kind…It does not have to be permanent, but it may be.” 
     
      
    28 The jury was further directed (SU 6-7): 
     
      
       
        
        “When it comes to intent, and there is a reference here to intent to do grievous bodily harm, intent can be inferred from the conduct of a perpetrator. And you can look at all of that when you consider the evidence. For example, the Crown has said that this is a circumstantial evidence case, and I will be giving you some directions about that in a moment, but there is a series of circumstances upon which the Crown relies when it comes to these events which occurred.  
        
       
       
        
        So they are basically the elements of the first charge. In particular, you will see that there is, in the second charge, no reference to ‘intent to do grievous bodily harm’. That is not the second charge. So there is a difference between the two charges, but only to that extent. 
        
       
       
        
        As far as the second charge is concerned, I give you the same directions when it comes to the issue of maliciously and the reference to grievous bodily harm, and it ends there in the second charge.” 
        
       
      
    29 By these directions, the Judge had made it plain to the members of the jury that for the appellant to be found guilty of the s 33 offence they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of each of three elements which included the element of intent to do grievous bodily harm, whereas the alternative count did not require proof of such an intent.  
     
      
    30 At the conclusion of the summing up, the Crown trial advocate asked for a further direction in the terms of the Criminal Trial Courts Bench Book in relation to intention, the third element of the s 33 offence as the Judge had given “a very brief direction in relation to that” with which request the appellant’s trial counsel agreed.  
     
      
    31 When the members of the jury returned, the Judge directed them in the following terms (SU 36-7): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        You will recall the directions I have given you in relation to what is meant by maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm and the question of intention. Intent and intention, members of the jury, are very familiar words, and in the legal context they carry their ordinary, natural meaning. Intention may be inferred or deduced from the circumstances in which an act occurs, or from the conduct of the accused before, at, or after a specific act occurs.  
        
       
       
        
        Now, here, you know the Crown’s case is that the accused kicked the head of Mr Mills, with the injuries which followed. In some cases, a person’s acts may themselves provide the most convincing evidence of his or her intention. So, where a specific result is the obvious and inevitable consequence of a person’s act, and where he or she deliberately does that act, you may readily conclude that he or she did that act with the intention of achieving that specific result.” 
        
       
      
    32 What was said by the Judge substantially followed the Bench Book direction. No further directions were requested by the Crown trial advocate or counsel for the appellant. 33 The additional directions were said by the appellant, in written submissions to this Court, to be confusing in the sense they did not distinguish between the mental element for the offence of specific intent and the mental element applicable to the alternative charge. Furthermore, it was contended that the Judge did not preface the additional directions by instructing the jury it must first be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who kicked Mr Mills before proceeding to consider the question of intention. The additional directions were criticised as being in a vacuum.  
     
      
    34 The additional directions were not confusing nor were they delivered in a vacuum. The Judge had instructed the jury as to the elements of the s 33 offence and the alternative offence and the additional directions on intent could only have been understood to relate to the third element of the s 33 offence. Much of the Judge’s charge to the jury had been devoted to the question of identification to which topic he returned in the additional directions. It is evident that the jury had been instructed that it must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who kicked Mr Mills before he could be found guilty of either charge.  
     
      
    35 During oral argument in this Court, the appellant contended that as the Crown case alleged one kick, it was vitally important that the Judge remind the jury what the evidence was in relation to what occurred at the time the kick took place. The appellant submitted that the Judge’s instructions conveyed to the jury that if it was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the kicker that was the end of the inquiry when it was not. The jury had to take the next step to decide inferentially from the evidence what his level of criminal responsibility was because it was one kick and the kick would not by itself show a specific premeditated intent to inflict grievous bodily harm. Reliance was placed by the appellant on the decision in The Queen v Wheeler (1844) 1 Cox CC 106 where Alderson B directed the jury that striking a single blow, even though grievous bodily harm be done, is not of itself sufficient to show an intent to do grievous bodily harm, which must be proved by other circumstances. That case involved a single blow with a fist.  
     
      
    36 The infliction of grievous bodily harm by a single blow does not preclude a conclusion being reached that the blow was struck with the intention to cause grievous bodily harm. Such an intention may be inferred from the nature of the single blow. It may be difficult to infer an intention to cause grievous bodily harm from a single blow with a fist whereas if the blow was struck with a baseball bat little difficulty might be experienced. Each case depends on its own facts. Hunt J in R v Stokes & Difford at 30 said: 
     
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “…it is usual to direct the jury in the appropriate case that a person’s acts may themselves provide the most convincing evidence of his intention. If, for example, a person deliberately hits another hard on the head with a hammer, it is easy to conclude from that act that he thereby intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon that other person. Such harm (or injury) was the result he sought to achieve by his act.” 
        
       
      
    37 In the present case, the nature of the blow which struck Mr Mills was not controversial. Whilst the appellant in argument in this Court referred to Mr Desoukey’s evidence that he saw a “motion of a kick” which was not a violent kick, Mr Desoukey testified that the kick did not connect with anyone.  
     
      
    38 The jury was told by counsel for the appellant in his closing address that “the only issue which [was] being ventilated by [him] on behalf of the accused” was “has the Crown proven beyond reasonable doubt that the person who kicked Mr Mills was this accused?” Nothing was said about the nature of the blow or the question of intention as the address concentrated on the issue of identification. It is not surprising that trial counsel adopted this approach. Upon the jury being satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who had kicked Mr Mills, it would have been easy for the jury to conclude from that act that he intended to inflict grievous bodily harm upon him. Various witnesses had testified that the Cabra-Vale player had run towards Mr Mills who was then on the ground and kicked him in the face. The Cabra-Vale player was wearing soccer boots at the time. Mr Roberts, in particular, described the kick as being very powerful, the kick carrying through until the Cabra-Vale player’s leg was horizontal and about four feet off the ground. Mr Taylor’s evidence was that the Cabra-Vale player kicked Mr Mills like he was kicking a shot at goal. The right foot was used and it was a very strong kick.  
     
      
    39 Whilst it is true that the Judge in summing up did not provide a summary of the evidence of each witness as to what had occurred at the time the kick took place, the Crown trial advocate in her closing address did so. She also told the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The third element [of the s 33 offence] that must be proved, beyond reasonable doubt by the Crown, is that there must have been intent by the accused to do the grievous bodily harm and my submission to you is that intent, as a matter of common sense, if you run at a person who is on the ground on all fours and kick them in the face with a great deal of force, as described by the witnesses which I’ve just gone through with you, then you intend to do them a really serious injury, that is grievous bodily harm.” 
        
       
       
      The Judge summarised in some detail for the members of the jury the closing addresses of both counsel. The circumstances of the trial did not require anything more.  
      
    40 In my opinion, the first ground of appeal has not been established.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The trial Judge erred in failing to direct the jury that merely finding beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who kicked the victim did not automatically mandate that the appellant was guilty of one or other of the offences charged.  
       
      
    41 Leave is required for this ground as it was not taken by the appellant’s counsel at trial: Rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules.  
     
      
    42 The appellant complains that the Judge did not instruct the jury that a finding beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was the kicker did not automatically mean they could return a verdict of guilty on the first or second counts. The appellant in support of this contention points to the Judge’s direction (SU 5): 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The real issue in this trial, which was been identified from the bar table, is the question of the identity of the perpetrator who kicked the linesman, Mr Mills.”  
         
        
       
      
     And later on (SU 11)  
     
      
       
        
        “In this case, the issue is whether the Crown has satisfied you beyond reasonable doubt that the perpetrator was the accused…” 
        
       
      
    43 The appellant submitted that although this was certainly a fundamental issue joined in the trial, it was not the only issue because the task of the jury was to determine beyond reasonable doubt the legal nature of the perpetrator’s criminal responsibility.  
     
      
    44 The Judge’s identification of the “real issue” in the trial was an adoption of what had been said by the appellant’s counsel in his final address. Although the summing up did not provide a specific direction that a finding that the appellant was the kicker did not automatically mean that he was guilty of either offence, his Honour said to the jury (SU 6):  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        And even though the question of identity is the real issue in this case, you, as Judges of the facts, still have to examine all of the elements of the charge.” 
        
       
      
    45 The jury was instructed in the passage quoted at [24] that the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt “each and every” one of the elements of an offence before he could be found guilty and the elements of the s 33 offence and the alternative charge were identified. The Judge reminded the jury on two further occasions that the Crown must establish all of the essential elements beyond reasonable doubt before guilt could be found. The jury could not have understood that a finding that the appellant was the kicker meant that he was guilty of either offence.  
     
      
    46 Although this ground of appeal was not taken at trial, I would grant leave to raise this ground. Ground 2 of the appeal, however, fails.  
     
      
    47 I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

   JUDGMENT 1. Gregory Glass is a forty-year-old father of an eleven-year-old daughter. In September of 2007 he was in what he believed were the early days of a new relationship with Angela Sponza. Both shared an interest in physical fitness. Glass had been running triathlons for fourteen years. He knew Ms Sponza had been receiving harassing calls on both her house land- line and mobile phones from an ex-boyfriend, Taris. There was an AVO in existence requiring Taris Meehan not to harass Ms Sponza, not to go within 100 yards of her premises and not to assault, molest or otherwise interfere with Ms Sponza or any other person with whom she had a domestic relationship.2. On 8 September, Glass and his daughter were sleeping over at Ms Sponza’s. Also in the house that night and following morning were one of her two daughters, her son and his friend Daniel and of course Ms Sponza herself. At 7am on 9 September in circumstances that I will come to in more detail shortly, Taris Meehan broke and entered into the dwelling of Ms Sponza knowing she and Glass were present, armed with two metal pipes and two kitchen knives, created mayhem for something like thirty or forty minutes, targeting in particular Glass, maliciously wounding him with one of the knives then left the premises but targeted Greg Glass’s Mazda sedan, smashing every window and panel of that vehicle repeatedly striking that vehicle with a rock. 3. Today Taris Meehan is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct on the morning of 9 September. An unusual feature of this case is that he told Dr Olav Nielsen that one of the reasons he had committed these offences was in order to be taken into custody for treatment. Indeed he had also told police the same. While I doubt it was the major driving factor of his criminal conduct, it does point to a highly disturbed man at the time of his offending conduct. 4. As sentencing Judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for these offences before this court committed by this offender harming this victim in this community, that is the community he was at Newcastle in the circumstances in which he did it. (See R v Gladue (1999) 1SCR 688 [80]).5. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender, which are called subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires me to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court and ultimately from them the objective criminality can be assessed. Some of those facts have already been set out in my introductory remarks.6. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, Form 1 matters, any backup charges brought from the Local Court to be finalised in this Court and finally of course the ultimate term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. What weight needs to be given to these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined, See (R v Cuthbert (1967) 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby (1977) NSWLR 597, R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740).Facts7. About 7am on 9 September, Ms Sponza’s boy and Danny were asleep in the master bedroom in a king size bed. Both I think were either very early teenagers or just about entering into their teenage years. Daniel gives this account: 
     
      
      “I was woken by loud banging noises at the bedroom window. I heard Angela screaming. The bedroom window was closed and locked and there were window coverings across the window. (I think the coverings were blinds made of a thin light coloured fabric). I put my head up and looked towards the window. The blind fabric was so thin that I could see through it. I saw Angela’s ex-boyfriend who I only know as Taris trying to smash the window with what appeared to be a crowbar. He hit the window about four times before it smashed. Once he had smashed through the glass, Taris used the crowbar to run around the edge of the hole to knock out more glass and make the hole bigger. I was so frightened by what I saw I fell of the edge of the bed and onto the floor. I became wedged between the bed and chest of drawers. I stayed on the floor as I was scared of what Taris might do to me. I was face down with my head cradled in my arms, I was then struck twice on the left side of my body near my ribs. I felt as if I had been kicked. It caused me a lot of pain and I was winded for a minute or two. While on the floor I heard the boy’s bedroom door open. I heard Angela scream and then I heard run off through the house as Taris chased her. I heard Angela scream frantically at Taris “Get out. Get out”. She then yelled “Greg please come and help”. 
       
      
    8. I pick up the story now from Gregory Glass’s statement: 
     
      
      “I got up from the lounge room and turned left around into the hallway. I saw a man coming towards me swinging an iron bar he had in his right hand. He was also carrying an iron bar in his left. As he got closer to me I realised it was Angela’s ex-boyfriend Taris. He swung the iron bar and the first blow hit me to the right side of my head above the right eyebrow. After the first blow I reached out, took hold of Taris’s right wrist. He then struck me to the back of the head with the other bar he was carrying. I recall seeing Angela tackling Taris around his legs. Taris and I started falling to the floor. As we were falling I felt a blow to the inside of the left knee with the bar. Taris and I hit the floor. I was disoriented for a few seconds from the blows to the head. As Taris and I were getting down from the floor I saw him produce a knife from somewhere on the right side of his body. I yelled “He’s got a knife”. That was to let everyone know because kids were in the house. Taris and I who were both standing up probably about arm’s distance apart. Taris lunged at me with the knife in an attempt to stab me. He tried to stab me with an overhand motion. I lifted my left arm instinctively and at the same time tried to grab his hand holding the knife with my right. The knife stabbed me on the point of the left elbow cutting me. Taris was then slashing at my left stomach and chest area with the knife. I had him held at arms length but the knife still hit my stomach and I could feel the blood running. Somehow I dislodged the knife from his hand and it fell to the floor. I then fell to the floor. Taris then left and I heard his footsteps on the broken glass at the front of the house. I could feel blood running down the left side of my head. I got up, saw blood everywhere on my clothes and could feel it running down my side and head. I made my way to the back of the house to get away from the view of the kids. When I got out of there I went into a state of shock. I don't know how badly I was injured. I felt cold”. 
       
      
    9. I come back to Daniel’s statement: 
     
      
      “I looked out of the bedroom door and saw Taris run back into Sonny’s room. He climbed back out through the smashed window. I did not see if he was still carrying the knife. Angela came to the room and told us to lock ourselves in the bathroom, which we did. While in the bathroom I heard Angela call police. As she was on the phone I could hear smashing sounds out the front of the house. Angela yelled out to Taris “Can you please leave?”. She said this several times. I’m not sure if she was still on the phone at that stage. A few minutes later I heard Angela yell out “Help” repeatedly. A few minutes later Angela came to the bathroom door and told us we could unlock the door as police had arrived. Angela told us to go and wait in the girl’s bedroom, which we did. While we were walking down the hallway to the girl’s bedroom I looked through Sonny’s bedroom window and saw Greg standing outside near the ambulance with a bandage around his head. I also saw that Greg’s car, a blue Mazda 3 had been smashed up. There were dents all over the car and most of the windows were smashed”. 
       
      
    10. I now review the offender’s version of his dealing with the motor vehicle: 
     
      
      “I then ran back into the bedroom, jumped out of the window onto the porch, ran back out to the front. I jumped over the fence and ran back out the front on the street. I then had lost one shoe. I took the other shoe off and I noticed blood all over me. I gave myself a quick check to see what was wrong with me. I noticed that I had a whole lot of cuts on my hands. I then started to bandage my hands. I took my jumper off and started bandaging my hands. I then grabbed a rock that was in the gutter and started smashing his car up. At that time I smashed the window, opened the door to his car, took a five-kilo bag of dog food out, threw it over the fence, opened the passenger side door up and then noticed his wallet there. I then ID him from his driver’s licence that was in his wallet. But I had been previously introduced to him but I did not know his name or exactly who he was previously and then I ID him. I went back down the side of the house and he [Greg Glass] was in the foetal position on a rocker bench with a blanket wrapped around him. I then asked him if he was alright, how he was, he looked up at me and he grunted and then I asked him how was the massage that he got a few weeks ago while he was having sex with Angela whilst I was minding Angela’s children”. 
       
      
    11. Finally on that score I come back to Greg Glass’s statement: 
     
      
      “When Taris climbed onto the railing, Angela said to him “Please leave”. He said “Don’t worry, I am not going to do anymore, I’ve done what I came to do”. He then said “I bet you wished you didn’t know her now [to Greg Glass]”. I feared for my safety so I got up and went into the office of the house”. 
       
      
    12. On 21 February 2008, Meehan wrote an account to Ms Sponza. It is clear from this account he had been watching her premises from about 8.30am on 8 September until some time after 11.30pm when he returned home. He took four sleeping pills but woke at 5.45am. He drove past the house early, returned to his home, kissed his sister goodbye, grabbed two knives and two pieces of car jack. He continues: 
     
      
      “When I jumped through the window I seen Daniel roll over off the bed. I was unsure who it was but I knew his bike was beside your car and Sonny was with him the day before. I thought it was Greg. I stomped on Daniel and pulled his hair. Sonny was screaming out to Daniel. Before I swung the pole I realised who it was. I then heard you and Greg move off the couch or you run from the kitchen moving the loose floorboard in the lounge/kitchen entrance. I saw your face. I jumped over Sonny saying as I seen Greg “You’re first”. I then confronted him. I wanted to stab him so I waited for him to come close to me. He did. After pulling the knife out I was scared and unable to hurt you or anyone else. I was so frightened that I ran back out the window. I smashed Greg’s car then went back, not assist in his injury but to do more harm. You made me think twice when you came out the back door. I remember your face as you stared at me through the laundry window. I thought to myself I’m never going to see you again but I love you so much. I then ran out to the police”. 
       
      
    13. Meehan had disconnected the handle of an hydraulic car jack at his home. The handle had split into two metal pipes, not heavy like a crowbar or an iron bar but nonetheless capable of injuring. The two knives were kitchen knives, each identical to the other, having a cutting blade of about twenty centimetres in length. They had been secreted in his underwear, one on each hip. Only one was used. The other was deliberately dropped by him at the scene.14. Gregory Glass was taken to hospital and on arrival at the Emergency Department a doctor’s examination showed that he was alert and orientated. His observations were stable. He was tender about the knee with some swellings and abrasions there but had a full range of movement. He had what the doctors described as two superficial lacerations to the left side of his torso, one measuring seven centimetres and the other measuring approximately four centimetres. There was a further three centimetre laceration on the left side of his back, again superficial. There was a slightly deeper laceration to the medial margin of his left elbow, which did not appear to involve the joint, which measured approximately four centimetres. He had abrasions on both his hands. There was a deeper laceration to the left occiput. This only involved again the superficial layers and there was no fracture. The left occiput is the left side of his head. There were two times three centimetre swellings above the right eyebrow, each very tender. There was a minor right frontal sinus fracture but there was no evidence of intracranial bleeding. The injuries were serious but it would be debatable as to whether in their totality they amount to grievous bodily harm.15. When asked what his intention was in the interview in regard to stabbing Greg Glass with the knife, Meehan answered “To give him some memories in his life. He’d given me one a couple of months previous. I was giving him one back. My intention wasn’t to kill him. Why kill him when he can suffer for the rest of his life?”. (See also questions 320 and 321 in the interview).16. Doing the best I can when Meehan makes reference to a memory he had been given by Glass, I understand that to be a reference to an occasion when he claims Greg Glass came to the house for a massage. Ms Sponza does remedial massages. While the massage was ongoing, Meehan continued with domestic duties cooking for the children. It is Meehan’s case that during this encounter between Glass and Sponza there was sexual intercourse. (See questions 198 and questions 268 and one that I have earlier referred to) in the course of reciting the facts.17. The worrying aspect of all this is that question 185 in his record of interview with police, Meehan claims to be unsure whether the man that he had seen accompanying Ms Sponza on 6 or 7 September was the same person or a new person to the person who had received the massage.18. Meehan had seen Ms Sponza with a man on 6 or 7 September. That man was most likely Greg Glass. It is Meehan’s case the male is said to have remarked to Ms Sponza “I am bigger than him [apparently referring to Meehan] do you want me to rough him up?” but the offender does not put this incident as one motivating his offending conduct nor is there any other evidence to support the account that he gives of that conversation.19. When asked by Dr Neilsen why he attacked Mr Glass, Mr Meehan replied that although he had only met Mr Glass on one occasion he felt “he had no right to be in the house”.20. On the occasion of the interview the accused denied any intent to hurt Ms Sponza or the children. That of course is contrary to the written comments made by him on 21 February and is a matter that will need to be resolved. It can be seen that there are three or four possible explanations for the offender attacking Mr Glass but even if all of the factors were taken together, they could not possibly justify an attack of this ferocity.21. While it would seem the separation of Meehan and Ms Sponza was not necessarily unwelcomed by Ms Sponza, it was Meehan who had initiated the separation. She had every right thereafter to move on with her life. She had every right to form any new attachment. There was nothing in the acts of Ms Sponza or Greg Glass that constituted any provocation for an attack of this order. Proof of provocative conduct falls to the defence. It has not been established in this case. In fairness it should be said counsel representing Meehan has not sought argue mitigation on such a ground. I have only dealt with it because of issues raised by the offender in his interview and elsewhere.Objective Criminality 22. From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing Judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing its seriousness. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in this case with the criminality of offences of similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of this offence can be evaluated. Not surprisingly the objective criminality has a very important impact on the overall sentencing outcome.23. The law has long put store on the sanctity of a person’s home. For example, police or Government authorities must in the normal course of events seek a court’s permission to enter even the most humble person’s abode. When such an order is sought the court must be satisfied that the purpose of entry is a lawful one. In this case, the purpose for seeking entry was a seriously illegal purpose. Entry was gained for the purpose of maliciously wounding Greg Glass. Meehan had written that his secret purpose was to kill everyone and then himself. That contradicts what he told police on the day of the offence namely that he was targeting Mr Glass. He did not want to kill him but wanted his memory to linger upon the attack and injury. It also contradicts what he told Dr Neilsen which was that he had told the truth to the police when interviewed. While I recognise his further confession to Ms Sponza constitutes a deliberate admission against interests, I am not prepared to accept it as accurately stating what was in his mind as he entered the Sponza premises. 24. Drawing inferences is very risky. The line between a well drawn inference and speculation can be a narrow one. For my part though, I am satisfied his first act was to attack the young boy in the first room he entered, that was the master bedroom. He thought as he began that attack that the person was or at least could have been Ms Sponza’s lover. Yet his first reaction was to kick the hapless figure and pull his hair. His first reaction was not to pull either of the knives from his possession and attack with them or it. My finding is that he was furiously angry but not murderously so.25. Meehan has always been conscious of the great moral wrong he was engaged in as he entered these premises. He was surrendering to anger arising from his depression, frustration and sense of impotence with his situation and perhaps even blaming himself for having created it. He may well have contemplated serial murder/suicide but that was not what drove his acts that morning. As he sat in his gaol cell no doubt reflecting on every minute detail of thoughts and actions some of which may well have contemplated serial murder/suicide that he entertained on the day or days leading up top the incident. Those contemplations had whilst he was in custody assumed an importance no doubt driven by feelings of guilt that resulted in an over statement of his intent on 21 February 2008.26. The criminality I am dealing with then involves the damaging of property for the purposes of unlawful entry, for a further purpose of unlawful assault on another with an offensive weapon intending to use it to cause a wound or wounds.27. The offending conduct was driven by desire to cause a lasting hurt to an innocent person because of the hurt and sense of humiliation being experienced by him, Meehan. His entry caused, and I find was designed to cause alarm among all other members of the household. The rationale behind him wanting to cause this alarm particularly among the children, I fail to fathom unless it was a means of vicariously causing stress and anguish to Ms Sponza. Of course any injury to her present lover would also have caused stress and anguish to her. That he succeeded in causing alarm and fear and possible longer lasting psychological injury to the children and Ms Sponza cannot be doubted. His intent and success in causing this alarm, fear and distress adds to his criminality.28. His coming armed and his use of weapons, two metal pipes and two knives aggravates the criminality of course. He only used two against Glass, one the metal pipe to strike his head and the knife to cause at least one and probably more of the injuries. Another was discarded in the house. My view is that it was discarded there for all to see and forever to remember. He had the means of doing great physical harm. 29. The evidence discloses that Meehan was paying close attention to Ms Sponza for at least two days prior to the break in. No doubt his frustration, resentment, brooding, anger and sense of impotence were percolating through his psyche. He had chosen to leave but could not do so. At some point before his entry he had taken sleeping pills some time after 11.30pm on 8 September. I cannot be satisfied in those circumstances he had already decided to break and enter the premises at the time or by the time he had taken the sleeping pills. 30. Unable to sleep he had woken early on 9 September. He had visited the Sponza premises, seen the blue Mazda and determined Ms Sponza’s lover had stayed the night. At a point in time shortly between this discovery and his return home, he had determined to enter the house and attack the lover. 31. This offence is not a spontaneous offence. It may be an impulsive decision was made but he returned home to arm himself. While the planning was by no means sophisticated, painstaking or thoughtful, there was at some level planning whereby he was able to take time to organise himself and better prepare himself to the extent that that was done prior to the offending conduct his criminality is aggravated. 32. The offence of breaking and entering Ms Sponza’s residence was done in contravention of a court order prohibiting him from so entering the premises, harassing them or assaulting anyone she had a domestic relationship with. There is a s 166 Criminal Procedure Act matter relating to that. I have been asked to deal with the s 166 matters and I intend to do so by dealing with that matter initially and to then accumulate the subsequent sentence onto it.33. The parties submitted the break enter and malicious wound offence fell within the mid-range of objective seriousness. I am interested in whether it does fall within the mid-range of objective seriousness because there is a standard non-parole period for this offence of seven years. There is nothing in my analysis of the objective criminality that suggests I should find otherwise. That is to say my assessment is that it does fall within the mid-range of seriousness.34. I now turn to assess the gravity of the contravene apprehended domestic violence order that I am dealing with pursuant to s 166. I intend as I say to set a separate sentence for that and I want it understood why I am doing so. The contravention was knowingly, indeed defiantly, done. It was done for the purpose of committing a serious crime of personal violence against a person who was in a domestic relationship with Ms Sponza. The breach was not an isolated incident. There had been forty text messages sent in contravention to the order. I am satisfied the tone of some if not all of those messages was, to use an euphemism, unpleasant so far as the recipient was concerned. I am satisfied on numerous occasions since his return from Queensland he had been within 100 metres of Ms Sponza’s residence. I am satisfied he was interested in her movements and the movements of others who may have had some connection with her. The breach was culminated in malicious damage to her property, a personal attack upon two occupants of Ms Sponza’s residence thereby creating a high sense of mayhem, fear, alarm and distress among at least six persons. I am satisfied this conduct constitutes a worse case of contravention of domestic violence and I intend to give a fixed term of the maximum sentence for it.Form 1 Offence35. In respect of the Form 1 offence which is the malicious damage to the motor vehicle, it is sufficient to say the offence was driven by malice at least towards Greg Glass, as I say it may also have been malice towards Ms Sponza hoping to cause her grief by the grief occasioned to Glass as a result of damage to an item that he clearly would have cherished. The damage done was thorough in the sense that every panel and every window was attacked. I think almost all but one of the windows was broken and each panel was damaged. The offending conduct will be taken into account when I set the sentence for the major offence that I am dealing with.Victim Impact Statement36. I have received substantial material taking the form of a victim impact statement or the supporting of a victim impact statement. None of that material has been sworn although Mr Glass did read the statement in court. It has not been subject to cross-examination. To the extent that opinions were expressed in the statement I recognise they are not the opinions of a qualified expert. But the victim impact statement coming as it does from the primary victim, if I accept it as reliable provides unsworn evidence as to the facts of the offence and their effect upon him. 37. The function of statements such as this one is, firstly to give to victims an opportunity of being heard in the sentencing proceedings by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma visited upon them by the actions of an offender. Secondly, they enable, hopefully, the sentencing proceedings to assist victims as they move towards some closure of grief, resentment and brooding arising from the serious criminal conduct of an offender. Thirdly, they hopefully contribute to an offender at least hearing at first hand and perhaps gaining some insight into the impact his offending conduct has had upon his victim. And finally of course they remain as a constant reminder to the Court of the impact crime can have upon the ordinary men and women who are its victims.38. I have sought to give some flavour of the material that has been exhibited before me in these remarks. I do not record them entirely. So far as the material provided by Greg Glass, it is a closely typed four page analysis of the impact Meehan’s home invasion and attack has had upon him. I have tried to catalogue it as it were into four sections. His enjoyment of life and how this offence has affected that; his career loss; how the offence has impacted upon his relationship; and the legacy of post traumatic stress that it has left him. So far as enjoyment of life, he says this: 
     
      
      “This [offending] has affected my being able to concentrate on the simplest of tasks and therefore my work performance. My work has been greatly compromised. I used to be a sales rep and was accustomed to getting Rep of the Year Awards. Now since the assault on me, I received a warning, a notification of unacceptable work performance…I used to be a highly functioning organised person and time management was my strength. I used to be up to date on everything and now I struggle each day to keep functioning normally. I always paid bills on time and was never in debt…My deterioration in work performance resulted in financial difficulties. Not only was I not performing my duties to an acceptable level but I would get headaches and would have to leave and go home and take medication and lie down. I have had to leave my job and get work elsewhere because it was too much pressure and my standards dropped so dramatically. I didn’t want to see that happen or let my employer down. I have had to get something less demanding even if it is a step backwards. My accumulating financial problems resulted in my daughter and I being homeless and having to relocate to less suitable circumstances”. 
       
      
    39. As to Mr Glass’s career loss he says: 
     
      
      “The assault on me has also had a huge impact on my future career in the police force. If it wasn’t for the assault I would have been in the Northern Territory working by now. Because of the trauma and stress I was under I didn’t pass my third and final psychological test, which I had passed the last two times. I had always planned a career change when I turned forty. Going into the police force was a dream of mine as I wanted to use my physical ability to help others. I wanted to end up in search and rescue. Moving to the NT to study as a mature age student has many financial incentives and was my chance to own my own home and start a new life with my daughter”. 
       
      
    40. Relationships: 
     
      
       
      “The assault on me by Taris Meehan changed all the relationships in my life, especially with my daughter and ended my relationship with Angie, the offender’s Taris Meehan’s ex-girlfriend which I guess was his aim. My daughter who was sleeping in the same room as me that night witnessed some of it, became distant and had a lot going on for her as a result. I became short and abrupt with her, which I had never been before and I think that scares her. My headiness makes me less patient with her and less tolerant of the simple things I used to tolerate. In the last couple of weeks my daughter has only just now started kissing or hugging or showing any affection towards me again. Her concentration was affected and therefore her schooling deteriorated. It is also a hard time for her going into high school and through her change of life making the impact and problems so much harder. She looked up to Angie and trusted her so the assault and relationship break up shattered her as well. My daughter and I have had to go to counselling. Following the assault, Angie became withdrawn, distant and cold. Because of what I was going through, I was on the edge and over reacting to things, which didn’t help the situation. When we broke up I felt betrayed and used…I have been socially withdrawn and my self esteem and confidence have taken a battering. When it comes to sport, work and future relationships, I have always taken pride in what I do professionally and personally and have never [previously] slipped in my standards”. 
       
      
    41. Post traumatic stress: 
     
      
       
      “I thought I was going to die that day. I didn’t know what was going on. Half asleep I got two blows to my head and then got stabbed. The people at John Hunter Hospital told me one more blow and I would have been dead. How do you deal with that?…I was a very private person and in a split second Taris Meehan caused such an invasion of privacy and has made me feel violated. I hate the thought that he went through all my things in the car. He also damaged my car causing financial loss. I used to be very independent and now I have found it very difficult to open up and trust all the people who have had to come into my life because of this assault both professionally and privately…I am fearful of any future injuries or violence. Any violence or anything remotely similar on the news or in the newspapers scares me and brings it all back making it even harder to settle or sleep. Things like the blood embedded in my licence are a constant reminder…I have been diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder. Now anything similar to violence triggers responses in me. For example when I was running and there were kids mucking around throwing thing to each other, I had to change my path and divert to get out of harms way…The hardest thing to ever get used to is living on the concoction of tablets when I never used to even take a headache tablet. The head injury has also affected my sinuses which in turn affects my physical activity and sleep”. 
       
      
    42. Finally enjoyment of life: 
     
      
       
      “I used to be very fit and run triathlons. I have run triathlons for twenty years and have been involved as an official in sporting events including Commonwealth Games. Training and physical fitness have always been a big part of my life. A big part of my identity and well being. Because of the attack and head injury my training ability has been severely affected. I used to train two hours a day before and after work. I would ride or run before work and ride or swim after. I have attempted to start training many times and failed and have had to try many different medications. Now I’m forcing myself to train despite the pain just to try and get back to feeling normal…I have found swimming impossible because after 200 metres I get heady and have to stop due to headaches and fuzziness. I am scared to cycle on the road alone because I don't trust myself on my own in case I get heady or black out and have an accident. It seems whenever I put my head down I get heady. It is something I miss greatly which gave me joy. In June of 2008 long weekend I attempted my first social run but when everyone was socialising afterwards I had to go to bed because of the pain in my head. It has also had a large impact on my social life because I can now no longer associate with people that I normally would through triathlons and sport”. 
       
      
    43. There are also two expert reports annexed to Mr Glass’s victim impact statement. They confirm the diagnosis of post traumatic stress. For my purposes it is sufficient if I refer to the report of Emma Lee, psychologist: 
     
      
      “On presenting, Mr Glass described himself as experiencing “A wave of overwhelming stresses” relating to the assault itself and the effects of this in a wide range of aspects of his life. Mr Glass experiences a range of symptoms indicative of post traumatic stress disorder including nightmare, flashbacks, hyperarousal, anxiety and reduced self esteem. Mr Glass reports ongoing jaw pain and headaches that limit his capacity to work and also train for triathlons, a key part of his life prior to the assault. In addition Mr Glass is also experiencing significant work and financial stress, loss of career opportunities and the breakdown of his relationship with his partner. 
       
       
      During his second visit on 6 June 2008, the Depression, Anxiety Stress Scale and the Impact of Events Scale Revised were administered to him. The DASS indicated that Mr Glass fell into the extremely severe range for depression, anxiety and stress. The IES-R indicated that in areas reflective of post traumatic stress disorder (avoidance, hyperarousal and intrusive thoughts) his negative response to the assault is also extremely severe”. 
       
      
    44. I will take the luncheon adjournment now and resume at two o’clock when I will come to deal with the subjective features relating to this offender.LUNCHEON ADJOURNMENTSubjective Matters45. I am required, as I said earlier, to have regard to the subjective matters. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offences that have been committed but I am also sentencing this offender for them. Matters personal to the offender may give some insight into or explanation as to why a more, or a less severe sentence is required. Personal Circumstances, Family, Background and Relationships46. Taris Meehan is a single man born in July of 1979. He is now aged twenty-nine. He has three siblings, a brother and two sisters. His parents are both still supportive of him. He had formed his first de facto relationship with Ms Sponza. He was attached to her children to a point of having a vasectomy so that he could have no other children. Apart from this relationship he had previously been in no other live-in relationship; but had had an association for some time with another woman in the Jehovah’s Witness congregation. This was the first time he had lived away from home but for a twelve month period in Tasmania where he attended a maritime college. He is a Kamilaroy man who was picked upon at school, and it seems during his apprenticeship, for his Aboriginal heritage. His mother had been fostered out to a Jehovah’s Witness family and he continues in that faith. He continues to read the Bible and Watchtower whilst in prison. 47. His only prior relationship was with a member of that congregation but that relationship was ended suddenly by her. Of significance so far as this matter is concerned, is his inability on that occasion to cope with her dismissal of him. There was a drive in a manner dangerous matter, where the view has been taken by those concerned with his treatment that he was seeking to commit suicide. There was also, at the same time, a contravention of an apprehended domestic violence order.Education, Skills and Employment48. He attended primary school as best I can tell in the North Coast areas and high school to Year 10 at Carrington. He was a good student. As I said, he also attended a maritime college in Tasmania and worked for a short period as a commercial fisherman. He used those skills when he was employed, presumably part-time, as a fish handler in one of the local restaurants. Those who then employed him have written references in support of him.49. He left commercial fishing to become an apprentice painter at the Maitland Hospital and is now qualified as a painter and decorator. He was completing Year 12 equivalent with a view to studying social sciences at University. After he qualified as a painter he became self-employed. He met Ms Sponza in the course of painting at her house.General Health50. There are no apparent physical health problems. At the time of his arrest he was described as having a passion for exercise. A day or two before the offence for example he was at the Sports Aquatic Centre for two hours. He did complain during the course of the interview of a magnesium deficiency. But the significance of that is not otherwise explained and I suspect it is more to do with peak fitness issues than with general health. 51. There are mental health issues. There is some family history of mental health issues. Meehan’s brother has a diagnosis of schizophrenia. The offender’s father observed to Dr Neilsen, a well-known forensic psychiatrist retained by the Aboriginal Legal Service that “Taris has always had some kind of problem but we don't know the diagnosis”. Meehan has in the past sought psychiatric assistance. In Queensland, just prior to this criminal conduct, he had seen a psychiatrist and the day before the offence he had seen a Newcastle psychiatrist. In July of 2007 he had been admitted overnight to the James Fletcher Hospital in circumstances, which I will come to later.52. In the course of his interview, Meehan is asked for a second or third time by police what was his intention that he formed at his mother’s house (questions and answers 281-286). 
     
      
      “Q. You decided to go around there, what did you decide to do when you were at your mother’s house by going around there? 
       
      A. What did I decide to do? 
       
       
      Q. Yeah. What was your intentions that you formed at your mother’s house? 
       
      A. Oh to be taken to gaol like to assault …to be taken away to help me deal with my problem that I’ve had for the last four months to get some kind of release from what had happened to me…like I’d been through psychologists and tried all different options until this option. 
       
      
    53. I have already discussed in some detail what motivated the offender’s conduct but the human mind is capable of holding more than one aim at a time. It is probable this offender saw as a “benefit” flowing to him from his violent criminal conduct that he may receive some therapeutic treatment in custody. 54. My view is that was a rationalisation by him making it easier to give in to his desire to express, criminally, the feelings I earlier referred to. But the answers to questions 281 to 286, and similar questions asked of him by Dr Neilsen, do show a breakdown in lines of logical, calm and rational thinking. He had attempted suicide whilst in Queensland. There may have been a past history of suicide attempt by the dangerous driving and the July 2007 admission to James Fletcher describes him as having a recent history of depression and suicidal thoughts.55. Dr Neilsen described him on examination as: Emotional range blunt. Speech stilted and monotonous. Gave literal answers to questions put to him. Responses had odd quality suggesting the presence of underlying psychosis.56. Dr Neilsen noted racing thoughts and over valued ideas in the period before arrest that may have been consistent with the hypermanic phase of bipolar disorder. He diagnosed a depressive illness and possible underlying psychotic illness. Dr Neilsen thought it very likely Meehan’s depressive state contributed to his offending conduct. That is, of course, a significant finding in terms of his offending conduct. It is one that I agree with. Dr Neilsen recommended intensive treatment for the depression and consideration being given to a mood stabiliser and low dose of anti-psychotic medication.Alcohol and Drugs57. While there was a past history of cannabis use, Meehan denied any current drug or alcohol use at the time of his offending.Character and Criminal History58. Meehan presents as a man in his late twenties with a strong work ethic who was seeking to enhance his education and seeking to advance himself by moving into the profession of social sciences. He had travelled fairly widely through Central Asia and Europe. There are only two matters on his criminal record both arising from the prior relationship in February of 1999 and both of which I have mentioned, drive manner dangerous and contravene apprehended violence order. For the first he was given fifty hours of community service and for the second he was placed on a s 9 bond to be of good behaviour for two years. His prior criminal history is minor. He is entitled to some mitigation on that account.His Rehabilitation Prospects59. Given the level of mental illness issues, his rehabilitation is somewhat clouded. But factors that are positive for him are his strong family support, that he has a trade; he has a good prior work ethic and history, that he has good health, that is good physical health, that there does not seem to be any negative conduct whilst in custody. On the other hand, what does raise the clouds are his mental health situation and the absence of any well thought out future or post-release plan, other than he would probably kill himself either when he gets the courage or upon his release. There is also an absence of insight into his offending conduct.Plea Status60. The plea was entered early before the Magistrate. He is entitled to the full discount of his plea.Contrition61. The offender has been open and frank with police. Contrary to the terms of his apprehended violence order he has now written two times to Ms Sponza, exposing what he says is a full account of his thoughts and actions as he invaded her home. He in surely understand this account can only be distressing for her and she gains nothing by receiving it.62. He concluded one letter “May God see our past and forgive us” and the other “May you live a life in peace knowing I am gone”. On the one hand as I say, his letter must be sent knowing it would be painful for her to receive. On the other, he expresses thoughts that would suggest that he wished her well. He acknowledges his offending and accepts he deserved punishment. Yet I doubt that he has focussed beyond his own mail to see the damage he has really done to Greg Glass and feel sorry for that.Setting the SentenceDeterrence63. The maximum penalty for the specially aggravated break and enter and committing the malicious wound is one of twenty-five years with a standard non-parole period of seven years.Standard Non-Parole Period?64. I accept Dr Neilsen’s opinion that the offender’s depressive state contributed to his criminal behaviour. That factor together with his plea of guilty and his minor criminal record take the offence even though it falls within a mid-range of seriousness, outside one requiring the standard non-parole period of seven years. Of course, even though it does not apply, it still must be borne in mind when I come to sentence.Prior Custodial History65. Meehan has been in custody since his arrest. His sentences will be back dated to 9 September 2007 when he first went into custody. All his offending has occurred at the same time. In respect of the contravene apprehended domestic violence order which is the s 166 matter, I have indicated that I intend to set a sentence for that. I have also indicated that in those circumstances I would not be aggravating the break and enter offence. What I will be doing though is to accumulate the sentence for the break and enter and commit malicious wound onto the contravene apprehended domestic violence sentence. So unusually, I will be dealing with one of the s 166 matters from the Local Court before I impose the major sentence. I have looked at the relevant section and as best I can tell I am entitled to take that approach.Totality66. I have borne in mind totality when setting the sentence for both offences. Because I am setting sentence for the first offence I am bound by the rules of the Local Court and the maximum penalty for that offence is one of two years. I intend to impose the maximum sentence because I regard it as a worst case, but I am going to discount the sentences by twenty-five percent. Twenty-five percent off the two years makes a sentence of eighteen months.Formal Orders67. What I formally need to do is to convict you pursuant to the powers granted to me by s 166 of the offence that you knowingly contravened a prohibition/restriction order (domestic) between 6.50am and 6.55am on 9 September 2007 at Birmingham Gardens and did knowingly contravene a restriction specified in that order. For that offence you are sentenced to a fixed term of eighteen months to commence on 9 September 2007 and to expire on 8 March 2010.68. Mr Meehan I also convict you of the offence that you pleaded guilty to before the Magistrate that you, on 9 September 2007 at Birmingham Gardens broke and entered the dwelling house of Angela Sponza situated in Morris Street and in that dwelling house committed a serious indictable offence namely the malicious wounding whilst armed with an offensive weapon in circumstances of aggravation, that wounding being of course the wounding of Gregory Glass. For that offence I would, but for your plea of guilty, have set an overall sentence of seven years. I have discounted that sentence by twenty-five percent which on my calculation makes an overall sentence of five years and three months. I set a non-parole period of three years and six months to date from 9 December 2008 and to expire on 8 June 2012. I set a balance of term to expire on 8 March 2014. If those sentences are, as I anticipate they would be, it constitutes an overall sentence of six and a half years and a minimum term on my calculation I think is four years nine months. 69. It would be obvious that in respect of the last sentence I have found special circumstances and I should indicate why I have done that. Firstly it is your first time in custody; secondly there are mental health issues and there is a need to establish a regime of community based mental health compliance and monitoring and I commend that to the Probation and Parole authority; and finally I have said because this sentence is cumulative upon the fixed term by fifteen months. 70. I should indicate to you that your release is not a matter for me, it is a matter for the Parole Board. Your earliest release date as I have said is June of 2012. You would need to satisfy the Parole Board that you are a safe candidate to be released and that means you need to address particularly your mental health issues.71. In respect of the charge of maliciously wounding Gregory Glass at the same time and place and in respect of the malicious damage at the same time and place, those matters are dismissed. The first because it is a backup charge and the second because, and I formally indicate, I have taken that matter into account when sentencing you for the break and enter and commit the malicious wound.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Thialal Toure appears for sentence today, having pleaded guilty before the Local Court to an offence of importing a marketable quantity of a border-controlled drug. The drug in question was cocaine, the quantity was significant. Indeed, there was 843.5 grams of cocaine secreted on the offender’s body when she arrived in Australia on 21 April 2008. That drug was part of an admixture of more than a kilo; 1,290.1 grams, in fact. 2 As might be imagined, the value of the drug was significant. The unchallenged evidence is that its wholesale value was at about $368,000 and its street value somewhere around half a million dollars. These figures demonstrate a number of things, perhaps the most important of which is the need to impose sentences which would deter those who might be tempted to make easy money out of drug trafficking. 3 The offender was offered, she says, 10,000 euros for carrying these drugs into Australia. Clearly those higher up in the hierarchy stood to make much more than that. A sentence that imposes a burden upon the offender consistent with the need to deter others who might be tempted to indulge in drug trafficking because of the easy money that can be made is therefore required. Of course, the offender was a courier; she was not high up in the drug hierarchy, but the Court of Criminal Appeal has said on many occasions that if those higher up in the drug hierarchy find it difficult to obtain couriers, then the evil trade in the trafficking and importation of drugs is made harder as a result. 4 The offender says that she was in financial difficulty because she had some medical debts which arose because of the need for her to receive treatment and her daughter to receive treatment. In her daughter’s case, she is a diabetic and requires regular insulin injections. She said that she approached a cousin of hers in order to see if she could make some money to pay off those debts. Part of the preparation for the importation in April involved an earlier trip to Australia in February. It is not suggested that on that occasion the offender imported drugs but as I understand her evidence, it was perhaps something of a dry run.5 Shortly before she left Paris to come Australia, she had been visiting her parents in Senegal. On her return to Paris, she went to her cousin’s friends. A quantity of cocaine was placed on her head and tightly woven into her hair, with a wig being placed on top. Another quantity of drugs was secreted in her bra. That was how she got the drugs into Australia. Fortunately, for reasons which are not clear, the suspicions of customs officers must have been aroused and she was searched on arrival in Australia and her offence thus detected.6 I must say that I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender did this in order to obtain money to pay off debts. There is no doubt that she did it to make money but whether it was to pay off debts she had incurred for medical treatment, I do not know. Her parents were in a position to pay for her and her daughter to visit them in Senegal but she did not ask them for money to pay off her debts because she said she was embarrassed. It is a remarkable thing, therefore, to commit a serious criminal offence as this, risking a significant period of custody, simply to avoid embarrassment.7 On the other hand, I am not satisfied either that this was an offence committed in order to buy some luxuries in Paris. There is no suggestion that the offender was living a luxurious life or wanted to live a luxurious life. It is common ground, however, that this was an offence committed simply to make money. The offender is not a user of drugs, and did not therefore have that level of desperation which is often seen when a drug addict agrees to import drugs. This was, I repeat, an offence committed simply for financial reward. 8 The offender was born in Senegal and moved to France as a young girl. There, she was placed in the care of an uncle who treated her very badly. She moved to Paris as a teenager and began work at Eurodisney in an unskilled area. She was studying tourism at university as well when she became pregnant with her daughter. She gave up both studies and work after her daughter was born in circumstances where, as I have said, they both became sick and her daughter is a diabetic. 9 It is common ground that the offender will receive a significant period of custody. Only such a sentence would reflect the objective gravity of her conduct. She is a French speaker. She speaks some English but did give evidence that there are no other French speakers where she is held in custody. She will find custody socially isolating as well. Other things that will make her time in custody harder are the likely lack of visitors that she will receive and perhaps most importantly of all, the knowledge that as she is locked up in Australia, her daughter is growing up in France.10 On the other hand, all of these consequences were well known to the offender when she, with her eyes very much open, decided to commit an offence, even, she said, an offence which she thought could lead to her being subject to the death penalty if she was detected carrying drugs whilst in transit in Hong Kong.11 There is conflicting evidence as to whether the offender is remorseful. The attitude of the offender as suggested in the presentence report to her offence is one that if there was harm caused to any drug users as a result of her importation of cocaine, then that was their problem rather than hers. 12 On the other hand, in evidence today she said that she felt bad about what she had done and further, she did attempt to assist the police, although as it turns out, all of the information was already known to them. Of course, assistance to police can not only be the product of remorse but can also be a deliberate attempt to obtain a lower sentence. In such circumstances, I am unable to find that the offender is remorseful.13 The offender did plead guilty and so has displayed an attitude of willingness to assist the authorities. The plea of guilty is no evidence of remorse, I could have added when dealing with this subject earlier, because of the circumstances of her arrest. She could scarcely have done anything else but plead guilty once she was detected with the drugs secreted upon her.14 I consider it appropriate to reflect the offender’s willingness to assist the authorities by pleading guilty by discounting the sentence I would otherwise have imposed upon her by twenty-five per cent. It was not suggested by Mr Cook that the circumstances of the offender’s daughter were such that I could take into account the hardship to her occasioned by her mother’s incarceration in Australia. She is being cared for by the offender’s sister whilst in France and whilst no doubt she will suffer as a result of separation from her mother but unfortunately such consequences are commonplace when parents are sent to gaol. 15 The Crown, in its usual written submissions, assisted the court with three cases determined in the Court of Criminal Appeal. These three matters followed the repeal of s 16G of the Crimes Act1914 (Cth). Two of them concerned heroin and one cocaine. Mr Cook made no submissions as to those cases, in particular, he did not suggest that the range prescribed in those cases was inappropriate. 16 In those circumstances, the sentence I impose is this: The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a head sentence of seven and a half years with a non-parole period of four and a half years. That sentence will have dated from 21 April 2008, which was the day on which the offender went into custody. The offender will be eligible to be released to parole on 20 October 2012. 17 Ms Toure, let me just explain to you the sentence I have imposed upon you. I have sentenced you to imprisonment. You will have to spend at least four and a half years in gaol. That starts from 21 April 2008, which is the day you were arrested at Sydney Airport. That means you are eligible to be released on 20 October 2012. Do you understand that, Ms Toure?

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Upon the presentation of an indictment before this Court charging him with the murder of his wife Flordelizza O’Connor, the offender Laurence Bede O’Connor pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. The plea offered by the offender was not acceptable to the Crown and the trial here in Dubbo proceeded accordingly. The only live issue at the trial was provocation, an issue determined by the jury against the offender. The jury found the offender guilty of murder and the offender is now to be sentenced for the commission of this crime. 
     
      
    2 The crime was committed on a property called Quandalli near Tooraweenah on the 7th July 2007. On that date the offender shot his wife twice, thereby causing her death. Two months after the shooting, the offender admitted to police officers what he had done, and showed them where he had buried his wife’s body in a relatively isolated location on the property. Later in the early hours of the 8th September 2007, following his arrest, the offender participated in a lengthy interview in the police station in Dubbo, in which he admitted to the shooting. Then on the 9th September 2007 he returned with police officers to Quandalli participating in a “walk through” of the crime scene, recorded on video, and he explained how and where he had shot his wife. Indeed a re-enactment was carried out with a police officer assuming the role of the deceased. The offender described how he set about arranging to bury his wife, by placing her in the bucket scoop of a tractor, and then taking her for burial up to the isolated location previously mentioned. The offender described how he buried his wife and placed lime on her body, asserting that the lime was used to deter wild pigs from disturbing the body.  
     
      
    3 The body of the deceased was submitted to post mortem examination which disclosed bullet wounds to the trunk and to the head. The entrance wound to the trunk was in the back at the level of the eighth vertebral column. It nicked the aorta and entered the left lung. The wound track was back to front slightly right to left and upwards. The entrance wound to the head was over the right temple. The skin was perforated and the path of the bullet was through the centre of the brain, settling in soft tissue at the back of the head on the left side. The path was slightly downwards. Though the offender in the demonstration earlier mentioned indicated that he placed the weapon to the left temple of the deceased the post mortem findings were otherwise consistent with the offender’s description of the shooting. 
     
      
    4 I shall presently refer in closer detail to the marital relationship between the offender and his late wife, but addressing firstly the day of the shooting, the offender’s version of the crime not the subject of dispute at the trial, was in summary as follows: 
     
      
       
      That on the morning of the 7th July 2007 the deceased climbed on to the roof of the residence at Quandalli to address a leak problem. The offender stayed near the foot of the ladder. The relationship between the offender and the deceased was not previously a harmonious one and whilst on the roof the deceased told the offender she had taken his car keys, his wallet, his cheque book and his deposit books and that she had burnt his tobacco. The offender searched unsuccessfully for his car keys and said when interviewed by the police that he had had a gutful of the deceased doing these things, which he asserted had been going on for years and getting worse and worse (see questions and answers 95 to 101, and 106 to 119, of the record of interview.) There was a loaded .22 rifle kept on the veranda, placed there for shooting birds that raided the strawberries and this was the gun the offender used. As the deceased was about to descend the ladder, the offender reached for the loaded rifle, released the safety catch, and in the course of her descent placed the weapon against his wife’s spine and fired without warning. The victim fell on to the concrete and was moaning. The offender then placed the rifle against the temple of the deceased and fired the second shot.  
       
       
      This outline of events I find to have been established on the evidence. 
       
      
    5 The offender admitted to the police that when he shot the deceased he intended to kill her (see questions and answers 144-145 and questions and answers 590-591 of the interview of the 8th September 2007). 
     
      
    6 I observed earlier that the central issue at the trial was the issue of provocation and this issue is to be regarded in the context of the respective backgrounds of the offender and of the deceased as established by the evidence which I now summarise. 
     
      
    7 The offender was born on the 6th June 1943 so that he is presently 65 years of age. Until the age of 10 years he lived with his father, his mother and his sisters near Dubbo. Then at the age of 10 years he and the family mentioned moved to Quandalli where the offender finished his primary schooling. He attended high school De La Salle College Dubbo but left school at the age of 15½ years having passed the intermediate certificate examinations. He returned to Quandalli where he remained until the time of the shooting, subject to a period on a prison farm to which I shall refer again later. He learned how to run the property from his father. Merino sheep, cattle, pigs and limited farming took place, and it was the offender’s father who made the business decisions. His mother did not participate in them. The offender’s father died in 1988 and his mother left the property some years later. After his father’s death, it was the offender who cared for the property. The offender expected his wife to follow his mother’s example in leaving business decisions to him once he took over the property. 
     
      
    8 In 1985 three years prior to the death of his father, the offender went to the Philippines where he met Flordelizza, his then future wife. He arranged for her to follow him to Australia and they married in this country. There were two children of the marriage Kathleen born in 1986 and James born in 1987. 
     
      
    9 The marriage was seemingly a happy one at the outset and both parents were devoted to the children of the marriage. However stresses developed between the parents and they increased after the children left home after completing their secondary schooling.  
     
      
    10 The evidence establishes that the offender’s physical integrity was impaired by two accidents. He hurt his back in an accident in 1989 and earlier in 1985 he had injured his right wrist. 
     
      
    11 The evidence established that the offender was an alcoholic. He was also an extremely heavy smoker. In 1977 when affected by liquor he was involved in a motor accident causing the death of a motorcyclist. He was convicted of the crime of culpable driving causing death and was sentenced to two years imprisonment with a non parole period of six months. He gave up drinking thereafter for some fifteen years but then started drinking home brew and this he did to excess. The deceased tried to ration the offender’s alcohol intake, allowing him to drink three bottles per day keeping the supplies otherwise under lock and key. The deceased kept the key to the place where the home brew was stored in her possession. 
     
      
    12 By 2000 the condition of the property had deteriorated. The homestead was dilapidated and the offender lost the enthusiasm to work the property, hindered as he was by his physical condition. He decided to lease out most of the property and the deceased resented the leasing. The deceased also resented the offender’s expressed wish to sell the property and to retire into town.  
     
      
    13 The offender resented the deceased’s wish to participate in decisions about the property and he resented the expressed assertion by her that she was “the boss”. Against the wishes of the deceased the offender renewed the lease to one James Terry shortly prior to the shooting. When the deceased learned of this she was extremely upset. In the words of her son James who heard his parents arguing on a visit home just before the shooting, his mother “went ballistic” about the issue of the renewal of the lease.  
     
      
    14 The deceased from the time of her arrival in Australia developed a strong attachment for Quandalli. The evidence discloses that the deceased was a devoted mother to her children and an industrious person who worked hard on the property growing vegetables and raising poddy calves, to all of which she gave pet names. The evidence also establishes she cared for the offender but they quarrelled about their future on Quandalli and the deceased was firm on her views that they should stay there and work the property themselves. The deceased was shrill in her expression of those views when arguments occurred. 
     
      
    15 So much is established by the evidence and this is the background against which the final events in the life of the deceased took place on the 7th July 2007. 
     
      
    16 I add to the above that the offender told the police that the shooting was not something that he had been thinking about for a while (question and answer 145). When asked why he decided to shoot her in the head the offender told the police that “she just got that nasty about any business decisions I made, she tried to overrule me” and that “she use to yell and scream and screech”. He added that “she had a real bad speech and it just got very nerve racking. The sound of her voice would drive you up the wall” (questions and answers 150-153). 
     
      
    17 The accused also told the police that he had not had any alcoholic drink since the night before the shooting. 
     
      
    18 Whilst the jury found against the offender on the issue of provocation, it does not necessarily follow that the issue of mitigation by reason of provocation does not fall for consideration. Indeed it does in the way I shall shortly address. In its written submissions the Crown referred to the dicta of Lee CJ at CL in R v Bell (1985) 2 NSWLR 466 at 485, and I record his Honour’s dicta in Bell which are relevant in the present context: 
     
      
       
        
        “The rejection of these defences does not necessarily mean that the accused cannot get the benefit, as a mitigating factor, at least to some extent of the factual basis upon which they rested. If the sentencing Judge is satisfied from the credible evidence in the case that there was a degree of provocation, he may take it into account as a mitigating factor. But every case must be judged according to its own circumstances and the question for the Court in every case will be whether on the evidence the factor being put forward as a mitigating factor has a relevant connection with the crime in its full sense as I have explained earlier.” 
        
       
      
    19 There were of course two ways in which the jury could have arrived at the decision here that the Crown had negatived provocation: 
     
      
       
      1. that the offender’s conduct in shooting the deceased was not as a result of losing his self-control by reason of any conduct of the deceased towards or effecting the offender; or  
       
       
      2. that the conduct of the deceased was not such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the offender to have so far lost self-control as to have formed the intent requisite to establish the crime of murder. 
       
      
    20 Since the verdict of the jury does not inform the Court precisely why it determined that provocation had been negatived, I must examine this issue in the present context, mindful of the remarks in Bell cited above. Any finding that I may make which is adverse to the offender requires proof beyond reasonable doubt. See R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374, in particular at 377-378. Any finding favourable to the offender requires satisfaction on the balance of probabilities.  
     
      
    21 There is much credible evidence which indicates that the behaviour of the offender at the time of the shooting was behaviour that contrasted with his behaviour at earlier times in the marriage when the deceased expressed her displeasure or disapproval towards the offender. Kathleen O’Connor gave evidence about her mother being an excitable person whose voice became elevated when she was arguing or angry. According to Kathleen O’Connor her father rarely joined in discussion when her mother became angry. Rather he simply sat there. Indeed in cross-examination Kathleen O’Connor said that whilst her mother became excited and jumped around in quarrels her father simply sat and listened. 
     
      
    22 James O’Connor gave evidence of hearing an argument between his parents when the lease was due for renewal. He said that his mother shouted at his father but that his father just sat there and took it. 
     
      
    23 A neighbour, Mervyn Braithwaite, who first met the offender in about 1995 described the offender as very approachable and well mannered. He said he heard quite a few arguments between the offender and the deceased. On such occasions he said there was a lot of yelling by the deceased but that the offender was pretty passive. In cross-examination Mr Braithwaite said that he did not witness the offender starting any arguments and he never heard the offender raise his voice towards the deceased.  
     
      
    24 There was no evidence that the offender acted violently towards the deceased or towards anybody else before the occasion of the shooting. I do not overlook the offender’s previous criminal offence but it does not assist me in relation to the issue I am presently considering. 
     
      
    25 A finding by the jury that the conduct of the deceased was not such as could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the offender to have so far lost self-control as to have formed the intent requisite to establish the crime of murder, would have been to my mind a readily understandable finding and as Mr Wilson pointed out the jury returned with its verdict shortly after being given further instruction on this issue. For my part having considered the evidence relevant to this issue I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct of the deceased was not such as could have caused an ordinary person in the position of the offender to have so far lost self-control as to have formed the intent requisite to establish the crime of murder. 
     
      
    26 Whilst the verdict of the jury reveals that the offender did not act under provocation within S.23 of the Crimes Act, I find on the balance of probabilities that the offender shot the deceased after the conduct by the deceased on the morning of the shooting impacted upon his self control and that he was subject to some loss of self control at the time of the shooting. In his evidence in this Court the offender accepted that the action of the deceased in hiding the bank books, keys and the tobacco were only childish acts. He said that he shot his wife out of frustration and annoyance and rage. He also acknowledged that he shot his wife for very flimsy reasons. Nevertheless following close reflection on the evidence in point I have made the finding expressed above and it follows that the offender is entitled to have taken into account as a mitigating factor the circumstance that there was some loss of self control at the time of the shooting after the deceased had conducted herself in the manner described in the evidence. 
     
      
    27 I turn to consider subjective features of this case.  
     
      
    28 I have already dealt with aspects of this in a review of the background of the offender set out in paragraph 7 and following above. 
     
      
    29 In the hearing as to sentence Mr Wilson introduced reports from Dr Allnutt and Dr Pulman. 
     
      
    30 Dr Allnutt made an assessment of the offender on the 15th February 2008 (see Exhibit 2 as to sentence). His opinion was that the offender manifested no psychiatric disorder which would have rendered him unfit to stand trial but Dr Allnutt invited a neuropsychological assessment directed to the possibility of a defence to the crime charged of substantial impairment. Hence it was that a neuropsychological assessment was made by Dr Pulman in May 2008 (see exhibit 3 as to sentence). According to Dr Pulman there was no evidence of any deficits in neuropsychological functioning that could be considered as substantial impairment under section 23A of the Crimes Act. The only other medical evidence introduced on the hearing as to sentence was a report from Dr Stephen Hampton. His report (exhibit 1 on sentence) was based on a review of records concerning the offender since he has been in custody. The report refers to no serious medical problems suffered by the offender. The opinion is expressed in this report that Justice Health will be able to provide services required for any treatment of the offender which may become necessary concerning his respiratory tract problems and other matters addressed in the report.  
     
      
    31 In his own evidence the offender told the Court that his health was better now than at the time of his arrest. The offender says that he entertains no suicidal thoughts now. He was treated for his skin cancer whilst in custody and he is presently on no medication. There does not appear to be any existing medical condition at present rendering the circumstances of his incarceration more burdensome than would otherwise be expected. 
     
      
    32 Whilst the shooting was deliberate and carried out with the intention to kill I do accept as Mr Wilson submitted, that the commission of the crime was not premeditated and that the rifle was within reach because it had been placed where it was to deter birds. The fatal decision which the offender took was taken whilst the deceased was on the roof, and shortly before her descent down the ladder. 
     
      
    33 I accept the submission made by Mr Wilson that I should find that the offender is remorseful and contrite in respect of his crime. In making this finding I do not overlook the fact that after the shooting he acted swiftly to conceal the body of the deceased and that he lied on many occasions, to his children, to his sister and to police officers about the whereabouts of his wife. I accept the submission made that in so acting the offender was significantly motivated by a perception that he needed time to put his affairs in order by selling animals, grain and machinery. In the period between the date of the shooting and his confession of his crime to police the offender drank to excess and he did so continually. But in any event whether in covering up his crime for some two months the offender was only motivated by wanting to put his affairs in order, nevertheless I find that by the time he confessed to his crime, the offender was indeed contrite and remorseful. Following the shooting, the offender contemplated suicide, as evidenced by his note and his map (see exhibits L and N). When interviewed on the 8th September 2007 (answer to question 457) the offender said “remorse. Pretty terrible thing. I’ve owned up.” He referred to the fact that he had two children and that they would never be able to look him in the face (see questions and answers 457 and 458). In his evidence at the trial the offender acknowledged that what happened on the morning of the shooting before he fired the shot could have been resolved, and he agreed that he had shot his wife for what seemed flimsy reasons. 
     
      
    34 I am satisfied that the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation are good. Indeed I consider it highly unlikely that this offender will re-offend at any time in the future. 
     
      
    35 I find that the offender offered considerable assistance to the police after he told a police officer on the 7th September 2007 that he wanted “to come clean”. Thereafter he confessed to his crime and showed the police where he had buried his wife’s body. 
     
      
    36 The manner in which this trial was conducted is to be considered. In focusing on the issue of provocation a shortening of the time taken up at the trial was achieved. The utilitarian consequence of this is a matter to be brought into account in the offender’s favour. 
     
      
    37 In approaching my sentencing task I must heed the provisions of Part 4 Division 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 
     
      
    38 The present case is not one calling for a sentence of life imprisonment nor does the Crown submit that such a sentence is called for. Accordingly section 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act needs to be considered. Under this section a standard non-parole period of twenty years has been set. Section 54D is of course to be read in conjunction with section 54A and section 54B. Section 54A(2) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        ”For the purposes of sentencing an offender, the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the Table to this Division.” 
        
       
       
      Section 54B provides: 
       
        
         
        (1) This section applies when a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment for an offence set out in the Table to this Division. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) When determining the sentence for the offence, the court is to set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence unless the court determines that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3) The reasons for which the court may set a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in section 21A. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (4) The court must make a record of its reasons for increasing or reducing the standard non-parole period. The court must identify in the record of its reasons each factor that it took into account. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (5) The failure of a court to comply with this section does not invalidate the sentence. 
        
       
      
    39 The effect of Part 4 Division 1A and how it bears upon the task of sentencing was considered in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 and in R v AJP [2004] 150 A Crim R 575 and again in MLP v R [2006] 164 A Crim R 93. 
     
      
    40 I refer to the judgment of Kirby J in MLP v R with which Grove J and Hislop J agreed. His Honour referred in MLP to what Simpson J had said earlier in AJP. His Honour described her Honour’s remarks in the earlier case as being “a helpful distillation of the principles in Way”. With that description I respectfully agree. What her Honour said in AJP was this: 
     
      
       
        
        [32] The following propositions emerge from  
        Way  
        and subsequent cases:  
         
         
        (i) while s 54B(2) requires, in sentencing in respect of an offence to which Division 1A applies, unless the sentencing court determines that there are reasons not to do so, that it set the standard non-parole period as the non-parole period for the offence, that obligation exists where the offence in question is an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness of offences of that kind; … 
         
         
        (ii) the standard non-parole period was intended for a middle range case where the offender is convicted after trial: a plea of guilty might be in itself a reason for departure from the standard non-parole period (para [68]); 
         
         
        (iii) a sentencing judge will be required, in relation to any given case, to hypothesise what is an abstract offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness in order to determine where the subject offence lies in relation to such an offence; such an exercise is, in reality, little different from the traditional sentencing exercise of evaluating objective seriousness of any offence, and should be approached intuitively and based upon the general experience of courts in sentencing for the particular offence (paras [74]–[77]); 
         
         
        (iv) circumstances that affect the evaluation of the objective seriousness of any offence include (but are not necessarily limited to) the actus reus, the consequences of the conduct, such factors as impinge upon the mens rea of the offender, matters of motivation, mental state, mental illness or disability (where causally related to the commission of the offence). Factors that affect the circumstances of the offender as distinct from the offence (for example, youth or prior sexual abuse) do not affect the evaluation of objective seriousness (paras [85]–[86]); 
         
         
        (v) that an offence is “typical” or “common” does not dictate that it is in the middle of the range of objective seriousness (para [101]); 
         
         
        (vi) the numerical frequency with which an offence of a particular kind is committed is not an indicator of the objective seriousness of any individual instance of that offence: (paras [101]–[102]); 
         
         
        (vii) where a court determines that there are reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period, the standard non-parole period nevertheless remains of relevance in the sentencing determination, as a reference point, benchmark, sounding board or guidepost (para [122]); see also  
        R v GJ Davies 
          
        [2004] NSWCCA 319 
        
       
      
    41 Having cited the above dicta Kirby J proceeded in MLP at [33] to [34]: 
     
      
       
        
        [33] The non parole period is, of course, but one aspect of the sentence. In respect of an offence where there is a standard non parole period, the sentencing Judge must at some point address the following issues when imposing a custodial sentence: 
         
        
       
      
    · First, what term of imprisonment is appropriate having regard to the offence and the circumstances of the offender? Guidance may be provided by the maximum penalty, statistics from the Judicial Commission and the collective wisdom emerging from a range of sentences involving similar conduct (cf R v Trevenna [2004] NSWCCA 43, per Barr J; R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247). 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · Secondly, should the offence be characterised as being in the mid range of objective seriousness? That task should be approached in the manner suggested by Simpson J (above), intuitively evaluating the objective seriousness of the offence and looking to those matters in s 21A, aggravating or mitigating, that relate to the offence (including the offender's state of mind). Matters in s 21A which form part of what is usually termed ""the subjective case"" of the offender are not relevant to the issue of whether the offence falls within the mid range. If the offence falls within the mid range, the standard non parole period should apply, subject to the remaining issues. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · Thirdly, are there other reasons in the matters identified in s 21A (relating to the offender) for departing from the standard non parole period? The subjective case of the offender (issues such as youth or prospects of rehabilitation (s 21A(3)(h)) may furnish reasons for departing from the standard non parole period. It should be noted that s 21A(1) provides that the matters specifically identified in the subparagraphs of s 21A are in addition to any other matter that the Court is required or permitted to take into account under any Act or rule of law. The fact that the offender may need to serve his sentence in protection, for instance, although not mentioned in s 21A(3), may be taken into account in determining whether there should be a departure from the standard non parole period. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    · Fourthly, there is the issue of special circumstances. Ordinarily, the non parole period bears a relationship to the term of the sentence defined by s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, that is, the non parole period must not be less than three quarters of the term, unless there are special circumstances. The sentencing Judge is therefore required to address that issue. If there is to be an adjustment, then it must not so deplete the non parole period that it is reduced below the minimum term which justice requires the offender to serve (Power v R (1974) 131 CLR 623 at 628; Bugmy v R (1990) 169 CLR 525). 
     
      
       
        
        [34] There is no requirement that these issues be addressed in any particular order ( 
        R v Moffitt 
          
        (1990) 20 NSWLR 114 
        ), although the issues are obviously inter-related such that a decision on one aspect may have implications for another. In addressing these issues, the sentencing Judge should, however, bear in the mind the following advice provided in  
        R v Way: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          124 The desirability of a judge adopting the practice of standing back after reaching a provisional sentence, and of reviewing it so as to be sure that it is appropriate for the offence at hand (see the observations made in  
          R v McGourty 
            
          [2002] NSWCCA 335 
           at [45]) cannot be understated, and the existence of a standard non-parole period is likely to be of assistance in this respect. 
          
         
        
       
      
    42 I heed what was said by Simpson J in AJP and by Kirby J in MLP in considering the sentence to be imposed on this offender. 
     
      
    43 The Crown has submitted, in my view correctly, that there are aggravating features of this case under section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) that the commission of the crime involved the use of a weapon (section 21A(2)(c))  
         
         
        (ii) that there were two discrete acts of shooting (section 21A(2)(m)) 
        
       
      
    44 Mr Wilson has submitted that there are mitigating features for the purposes of section 21A(3): 
     
      
       
        
        (i) the offence was not part of a planned activity (section 21A(3)(b)). 
         
         
        (ii) the offender was provoked by the deceased (section 21A(3)(c)). 
         
         
        (iii) the offender has no record relevant for present purposes (section 21A(3)(e)). 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) the offender is to be considered of good character (section 21A(3)(m)). 
         
         
        (v) the offender is unlikely to re-offend (section 21A(3)(g)). 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation (section 21A(3)(h)). 
         
         
        (vii) the offender has shown remorse (section 21A(3)(i)). 
        
       
       
        
        (viii) the offender provided assistance to law enforcement authorities (section 21A(3)(m)). 
        
       
      
    45 I consider that the evidence establishes the existence of each of the mitigating features advanced by Mr Wilson. As to provocation, I have previously expressed my finding as to there being some measure of loss of self-control (see para 26 above). I earlier identified assistance I find the offender offered to the police and he also identified to them the fire arm that he had used.  
     
      
    46 I have concluded that the present offence is below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of murder, albeit not by much. In reaching this conclusion I am mindful of the lack of premeditation and the absence of planning, and the fact that the offender was subjected to some loss of self-control.  
     
      
    47 There are also of course the mitigating features found for the purpose of section 21A(3) to be considered in order to arrive at an appropriate non-parole period and in order to structure a suitable sentence. 
     
      
    48 In the course of his submissions, Mr Wilson referred to the sentences imposed in many cases for the crime of murder. I have considered each of the decisions to which I have been referred in the written submissions, but I do not consider it would be useful to review all those decisions here. One of those cases was R v Toki [2003] NSWCCA 125. In Toki Hidden J reviewed sentences imposed in cases of murder in the setting of an intimate relationship. Having conducted an extensive review and identifying certain exceptional cases his Honour concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        “otherwise sentences ranged from 14 to 24 years, the majority of them being less than 20 years” (para 29). 
        
       
      
    49 The decision in Toki preceded the introduction of Part 4 Division 1A and in R v Youmaran [2008] NSWSC 762 Rothman J remarked (at para 4) “the introduction of a standard non-parole period for the crime of murder had a significant effect in increasing the range of sentences generally imposed for the crime of murder.”. His Honour’s observations accord with my review of the cases. The observation also seems to be consistent with the schedule of sentences which Mr Wilson handed up in the course of submissions. 
     
      
    50 Ultimately of course my task is to determine what sentence is appropriate in the present case by reference to the particular features of it, both objective and subjective. 
     
      
    51 A Victim Impact Statement was read in Court by Kathleen O’Connor and this statement refers to the tragic consequences of what happened, particularly concerning herself and her brother. It is appropriate that the impact of the crime committed by the offender be acknowledged. However I must heed the relevant provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act and the decisions in Previtera [1997] 94 A Crim R 76; Bollen (1998) 99 A Crim R 510; Berg [2004] NSWCCA 300 and King [2004] NSWCCA 444. It is not appropriate, following the authorities mentioned, that I be influenced by the content of the Victim Impact Statement in determining an appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    52 Mr Wilson submitted that there are special circumstances for the purposes of section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Mr Wilson refers to the offender’s age and to the circumstance that the length of the sentence to be imposed may mean that the offender could spend the rest of his life in custody. He submitted further that as he ages the hardship associated with the offender’s incarceration will increase. Reference was made to R v Holyoak [1995] 82 A Crim R 502. In that case Allen J remarked that advanced age is not a reason for not imposing a proper penalty even if the penalty imposed would mean that the offender may spend the whole of his remaining years in custody. However Allen J proceeded to say:  
     
      
       
        
        “Of course, account must be taken of how much more onerous it will be for him to serve a gaol sentence than it would be if he were younger. That is material to the appropriate length of the full-time custody. It does not make proportionality irrelevant. Likewise, the effect of the sentence upon general deterrence is not irrelevant. What, however, is appropriate by way of full-time custody, viewed from the point of view of general deterrence, must be considered in the light of the impact upon public perception of a gaol sentence imposed upon a man of such advanced years upon whom the sentence would bear the more heavily because of his very age and the real risk that he will never walk free. These considerations weigh heavily upon me.  
        
       
      
    53 The observations made by Allen J in the above cited passage are not to be ignored. I am mindful of the fact that the offender is at present sixty-five years of age and I do not overlook this in deciding upon an appropriate sentence. However I am not persuaded that there are special circumstances which would warrant reduction of the non-parole period which I here consider to be appropriate, by reason of the offender’s age. I have expressed findings in relation to the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation and consider no longer period than that which I am about to set by way of the balance of the term is required in this case. Moreover I consider the non parole period for the sentence should be no less than I am about to set, having regard to the objective gravity of the crime committed by the offender. 
     
      
    54 Whilst I have determined that the present offence is below the middle of the range of objective seriousness for the purposes of Division 4 Part 1A it by no means follows that this crime committed by the offender is to be regarded as anything other than a serious offence as indeed are all offences of murder. The offender shot his unsuspecting victim twice at close range with intent to kill. The crime he committed was a callous and a cowardly one. The crime is to be denounced and considerations of deterrence and punishment of the offender must be adequately addressed. 
     
      
    55 The offender has been in custody since the 7th September 2007. The sentence is to be backdated accordingly. 
     
      
    56 I now proceed to pass sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Laurence Bede O’Connor, for the murder of Flordelizza O’Connor I sentence you to a non-parole period of 16 years commencing on the 7th September 2007 and expiring on the 6th September 2023 and to a balance of term of 5 years commencing on the 7th September 2023 and expiring on the 6th September 2028. The earliest date upon which you will be eligible for release on parole will be 6th September 2023.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 6 September 2007, Latham J gave judgment for the respondent in proceedings in which the appellant had sued the respondent for damages for personal injury, arising out of a motor vehicle accident that occurred at Picton shortly after midnight on the morning of 31 July 1999. The appellant appeals from that decision.  
     
      
       
      Circumstances  
      
    2 The accident occurred in Argyle Street, Picton about 60 metres or thereabouts north of the intersection of Argyle Street and Lumsdaine Street.  
     
      
    3 It was clearly established that, just before the impact of the respondent’s vehicle with the appellant, the appellant was in the north-bound lane of Argyle Street, about one metre or thereabouts west of the continuous double white lines that separated the north-bound lane from the two (uphill) south-bound lanes. Although there was only one north-bound lane, there was a narrower parking lane adjacent to it.  
     
      
    4 It is also clear that there were street light poles near the western edge of the north-bound parking lane, at approximately 45 metre intervals. One pole approximately opposite the intersection with Lumsdaine Street (referred to as pole 123) had a functioning light. The next pole to the north, pole 122, had no light affixed to it. The next one to the north, pole 121, had a non-functioning light. The next one, pole 120, had a functioning light. The appellant was approximately 10 metres or thereabouts to the north of pole 122 when he was struck by the respondent’s car.  
     
      
    5 It is clear also that, prior to the accident, the respondent was travelling north along Argyle Street in her Mazda MX-5 sedan, at a speed in the order of 55 kilometres per hour. She went through a shallow right-hand curve that began just before the intersection with Lumsdaine Street and finished just after that intersection, about 35 metres south of pole 122.  
     
      
    6 Skid-marks on the road commenced about 2.6 metres north of pole 122. At a point about 8.9 metres north of pole 122, the skid-marks from the rear wheels deviated slightly to the left of those from the front wheels, indicating that from that point the car rotated slightly clockwise. The skid-marks ended about 18.2 metres north of pole 122. A pool of blood on the road indicated that the appellant came to rest about 28 metres north of pole 122.  
     
      
    7 The impact between the appellant and the respondent’s car shattered the driver’s side of the windscreen. The appellant suffered severe injuries. When admitted to hospital, he was found to have a blood alcohol reading of 0.226.  
     
      
    8 The appellant had no recollection of the accident. Accounts of the accident were given by an associate of the appellant who was in the vicinity (Mr Sanderson), a south-bound driver (Ms Sheen) and the respondent. Although there were some differences in these accounts, these differences were in the end only of minor significance.  
     
      
    9 The respondent’s evidence was summarised as follows by the primary judge:  
     
      
       
        
        [24] The defendant gave evidence that she was licensed for four years as at the date of the accident. She was familiar with Argyle Street in that she drove along it each day. She very rarely saw pedestrians on the western side of this part of the street during the day, although she was aware that pedestrians more commonly used the footpath on the eastern side. She had seen no pedestrian activity along Argyle street at night. The defendant acknowledged that she noticed before the date of the accident that the streetlights immediately to the north of Lumsdaine street were not working. 
         
         
        [25] On the night of the accident she was travelling between 50 and 60 kph in a northerly direction, probably with the headlights on low beam. There were no cars in front of her or behind her. One car passed her, travelling in the opposite direction, near the school south of the intersection with Lumsdaine Street. 
         
         
        [26] As the defendant came around the sweeping right-hand bend at the intersection with Lumsdaine Street, the area beyond it was very dark. She was conscious of the headlights of her car sweeping from the western kerb of Argyle street to the centre of Argyle street, as she negotiated the bend at the intersection with Lumsdaine Street. As her car straightened up, she saw a person standing on the roadway in front of her car. There were no headlights coming towards the defendant at this time. She said she did not know where the person came from. She slammed on the brakes, skidded and about a second later, the plaintiff hit her car, right in front of her. The plaintiff rolled off her car to her right hand side and came to rest on the other side of the road, with his feet towards her car and his head extending towards the western footpath. 
         
         
        [27] The defendant saw no other person, or any movement on the roadway. She was not sure if the plaintiff was moving before she hit him. After the impact, she got out of the car and saw a man walking towards her from the eastern footpath further up the hill (Mr Sanderson). The defendant said that Mr Sanderson told her that he had been telling the plaintiff to get off the road. The defendant noted the damage to her car caused by the impact with the plaintiff. The driver’s side headlight was pushed back into its housing, the windscreen immediately in front of the driver’s seat was shattered and there was a dent in the roll-bar at the top of the windscreen. The defendant was not aware that any damage had been caused to her number plate.  
        
       
      
    10 Expert evidence was given by Mr Johnston for the appellant and Mr Keramidas for the respondent. There were differences between them, particularly concerning the visibility of the appellant to the respondent and, most importantly, the point of impact. According to Mr Johnston, the impact occurred at about the time the skid-marks began, and (accepting that the front of the car was about three metres from its rear wheels) this would put the impact about six metres north of pole 122. According to Mr Keramidas (and also according to a police officer Senior Constable Bain, who attended the scene), it was the impact that caused the car to rotate, thus putting the point of impact at about 12 metres north of pole 122.  
     
      
       
      Decision of primary judge  
      
    11 The primary judge was critical of the evidence of Mr Johnston, and accepted the evidence of Keramidas in relation to the visibility of the appellant and the point of impact.  
     
      
    12 She referred to a number of cases, including Evans v Lindsay [2006] NSWCA 354, and concluded:  
     
      
       
        
        [76] The circumstances of the instant case are of quite a different order. The defendant had no reason to think that there would be any pedestrian activity at that time of the night in Argyle St, let alone that she would encounter a pedestrian in the middle of the roadway. Accepting her evidence as I do, she was driving at an appropriate speed and was in full control of the vehicle as she approached the intersection of Argyle St with Lumsdaine St. There could be no negligence in the defendant maintaining her headlights on low beam, given that she was not challenged in respect of having passed a vehicle travelling in the opposite direction near the school in Argyle street and Ms Sheen’s vehicle approached the defendant from the south at some stage prior to impact with the plaintiff.  
         
         
        [77] The physical conditions prevailing at the accident site are of considerable significance in assessing the range of reasonable responses available to the defendant. After the defendant negotiated the right-hand bend at Lumsdaine St, she emerged from a relatively well lit area into a dark area that extended in excess of 100 m, her headlights only illuminating the left side of the road for some distance before illuminating the road ahead where the plaintiff stood. Coupled with the need for the defendant's eyes to adjust to the changed light conditions, together with the likelihood of the disability glare produced by Ms Sheen's headlights, the defendant had little or no time within which to register that the object on the roadway was a pedestrian, before applying the brakes.  
         
         
        [78] As the evidence of Mr Keramidas explains, at a pre-impact speed of 53 kph, the defendant was travelling at 13.7m per second, yet she had less than 35m within which to avoid impact with the plaintiff (taking the outer limits of the visibility range). A reasonable reaction time of between 1.5 and 2.5 seconds in these circumstances effectively means that the defendant had already travelled between 20.5m and 34m before she could reasonably be expected to apply the brakes.  
         
         
        [79] Once the defendant had applied the brakes and the wheels of her vehicle had locked, the defendant had no means of changing the direction of travel. The defendant applied the brakes as soon as she was reasonably able to do and there was nothing that she could have done thereafter to avoid impact with the defendant. In other words, adopting Beazley JA's formulation in  
        Evans v Lindsay 
        , the dynamics confronting the defendant did not allow for any other reasonable response on the part of the defendant and I am therefore not satisfied that the plaintiff has succeeded in establishing negligence on the defendant's part.  
        
       
      
    13 The primary judge then indicated that, if she had found the respondent negligent, she would have assessed contributory negligence at 80 per cent; and she assessed damages.  
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal  
      
    14 The appellant’s notice of appeal specified the following grounds:  
     
      
       
        
        1 The trial judge erred in finding a verdict for the respondent.  
         
         
        2 The trial judge erred in factual findings as to the circumstances of the motor vehicle accident the subject of the appellant's claim for personal injury damages.  
         
         
        3 The trial judge erred in failing to find that respondent's negligence caused the appellant's injury, loss and damage.  
         
         
        4 The trial judge erred in failing to accord sufficient weight to the evidence of an independent witness (Sheen).  
         
         
        5 The trial judge erred in factual findings made in respect of the evidence of independent witnesses (Sheen, Sanderson, Hayes and Senior Constable Bain).  
         
         
        6 The trial judge erred in factual findings made in respect of the evidence of the respondent.  
         
         
        7 The trial judge erred in factual findings made in respect of the physical evidence (the damage to the respondent's motor vehicle, the skid marks, lighting and sources of lighting).  
         
         
        8 The trial judge erred in factual finding made as secondary findings of fact (point of impact, position on roadway, lighting, illumination and visual detection).  
         
         
        9 The trial judge erred in rejecting the evidence of an expert witness (Johnston) and erred in finding that an expert witness (Johnston) was not a witness of credit.  
         
         
        10 The trial judge erred in failing to permit an expert witness (Johnston) to provide an oral exposition of the expert's opinion that was set out in a written report.  
         
         
        11 The trial judge erred in failing to properly understand the relevance of an expert witness (Johnston) as to the circumstances of the motor vehicle as that expert opinion related to other evidence including other expert evidence.  
         
         
        12 The trial judge erred in the procedural decisions concerning the adducing of the evidence of an expert witness (Johnston) and evidence as to liability matters, including a failure to grant an adjournment of the hearing, so as to cause a substantial miscarriage of justice, including the failure to afford the appellant the opportunity of presenting the appellant's evidence as to liability in a manner appropriate to the complexities of the evidence and the liability circumstances.  
         
         
        13 The trial judge erred, as a consequence of the matters referred to in paragraphs 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 above, in failing to properly, or at all, understand the proper relevance of the expert and non-expert evidence as to the liability circumstances.  
         
         
        14 The trial judge erred in finding that certain allegations of negligence required amendment to the pleadings (failure to operate headlights on high-beam) and erred in refusing to grant the appellant leave amend the pleadings accordingly.  
         
         
        15 The trial judge erred in the application of  
        Manly v Alexander 
         (2005) 80 ALJR 413.  
         
         
        16 The trial judge erred in the assessment of contributory negligence at 80%.  
         
         
        17 The trial judge erred in the assessment of damages.  
         
         
        18 The trial judge erred in failing to state proper reasons in the assessment of damages.  
         
         
        19 The trial judge erred in factual findings, including factual findings arising from expert evidence as to quantum matters, in the assessment of damages.  
        
       
      
    15 Not all of these grounds were pursued. In relation to liability, the matters raised by the appellant can be dealt with under the following headings:  
     
      
      (1) Alleged errors in relation to evidence generally.  
      (2) Errors in relation to expert evidence.  
      (3) Errors in the application of legal principles.  
      
    16 The appellant’s submissions also raised two further matters:  
     
      
      (4) Contributory negligence.  
      (5) Damages.  
      
    17 I will consider these matters in turn.  
     
      
       
      Errors in relation to evidence generally 
      
    18 The appellant provided extensive written submissions on this matter (Orange 18-15) which were not elaborated on orally. It was submitted that the primary judge erred in failing to resolve certain differences in the evidence and also in coming to the wrong conclusions on certain matters.  
     
      
    19 It was submitted for the appellant that the primary judge should have made the following findings of fact:  
     
      
      (1) The respondent was aware prior to the accident of pedestrian traffic along this stretch of road at night-time as well as day-time.  
      (2) The respondent was aware prior to the accident that there were street lights not working in the vicinity of the collision and that the area was therefore particularly dark.  
      (3) The respondent did not have actual recollection of the area illuminated by her headlights on the night of the collision as she navigated the bend in the road.  
      (4) The respondent could have had her lights on high beam.  
      (5) A reasonable reaction time was 1.5 to 2 seconds.  
      (6) Mr Sanderson was on the roadway but moved off it to the east prior to the collision.  
      (7) Mr Sanderson and Ms Sheen did not hear any screeching of tyres or skidding prior to the bang caused by the respondent’s car hitting the appellant.  
      
    20 In my opinion, there was no material error by the primary judge in respect of any of these matters.  
     
      
    21 Point (1) was referred to by the primary judge (Judgment [24]) and there is no reason to think it was not adverted to by her.  
     
      
    22 As regards point (2), the respondent’s evidence was to the effect that she had seen pedestrians on the footpath at night (2 Black 797), so if there was any error in what the primary judge said at [24], it was immaterial.  
     
      
    23 As regards points (3) and (4), it was a reasonable inference that the respondent’s lights were on low beam, in circumstances where the respondent recalled just having passed a car coming in the opposite direction and in circumstances where the area generally had street lights. Certainly, there was no basis on which an inference could be drawn that the respondent had her lights on high beam. A conclusion that the illumination provided by the respondent’s lights, on low beam, would have moved from the left of the roadway towards the centre as the respondent came through and out of the curve was a reasonable and correct inference.  
     
      
    24 As regards point (5), the primary judge’s conclusion did not depend upon any finding that a reasonable reaction time was longer than two seconds.  
     
      
    25 As regards point (6), Ms Sheen’s evidence, which supported a finding that Mr Sanderson had been on the roadway, was not such as to support a conclusion that he had been on the roadway at a time when he should have been seen by the respondent. For that reason, even if Ms Sheen’s evidence had been accepted entirely, in preference to that of Mr Sanderson, it could not have affected the result of the case.  
     
      
    26 As regards point (7), neither witness was asked whether they heard any screeching of tires or skidding after the bang, so their evidence does not give significant support to a finding that there could not have been skidding for a very short time prior to the bang.  
     
      
       
      Expert evidence  
      
    27 It was submitted for the appellant that there were errors by the primary judge in reaching an adverse view of the evidence given by Mr Johnston, and not accepting that evidence, particularly in the following respects:  
     
      
      (1) The primary judge was not justified in considering that Mr Johnston had belatedly tailored his opinion to challenge Senior Constable Bain’s evidence as to the point of impact (Judgment [51]).  
      (2) The primary judge was not correct to say that the foundation of his opinion as to the point of impact was that the impact was a central impact (Judgment [53]).  
      (3) The primary judge was not correct to say that Mr Johnston’s reasoning based on throw distance was circular (Judgment [55]).  
      
    28 I note that the primary judge also said (Judgment [69]) in relation to Mr Johnston that his demeanour was at times defensive, evasive and argumentative, and that he adopted a partisan approach to the preparation of the report which was admitted into evidence after he became aware of serious deficiencies in his original report.  
     
      
    29 It is not possible from the transcript to get a full impression of Mr Johnston’s demeanour; but in my opinion, the content of the transcript amply supports these views of the primary judge. To take three examples:  
     
      
      (1) Mr Johnston’s attempt (1 Black 503LM) to minimise the importance of his earlier serious mistake as to the direction of the curve.  
      (2) Mr Johnston’s evasion (1 Black 518) of questions concerning the omission from his report of any explanation of the divergent skid-marks.  
      (3) Mr Johnston’s attempts (1 Black 521) to maintain that the impact by the appellant on the car was a central impact.  
      
    30 In my opinion also, Mr Johnston’s attempt (1 Black 534) to minimise the effect on the respondent’s car of the impact of the appellant on the windscreen is damaging to his expertise. The question at lines 13 to 15, referring to absorption of energy from the pedestrian, was not aptly expressed; but in my opinion, an expert attempting to assist the court should have provided a response that was helpful and not misleading. It was correct to say there was no transfer of energy from the pedestrian to the motor vehicle: what there was, in terms of energy, was a transfer of energy from the motor vehicle to the pedestrian, resulting in a loss of kinetic energy in the motor vehicle corresponding with a slowing of the motor vehicle’s speed. It would have been more helpful and relevant to analyse the matter in terms of the forces involved: when the car applied sufficient force to accelerate the appellant from being stationary to a speed in the order of 40 to 50 kilometres per hour, Newton’s third law shows that the same force was applied in the opposite direction by the pedestrian onto the car. Accepting, as did Mr Johnston, that the appellant had about one-tenth of the mass of the car, this force would plainly be substantial. Since the major damage to the car was to the driver’s side of the windscreen, it is reasonable to infer that very substantial force was applied to this part of the windscreen.  
     
      
    31 As regards the three matters raised by the appellant, there is, having regard to the matters I have just discussed, no substance in the first two of them. However, as regards the third of them, I accept the submission that Mr Johnston’s argument based on throw distance was not circular, and did give some rational support to his view that the impact occurred at about the same time as the skidding commenced. However, the other matters to which I have referred gave adequate ground for placing little weight on the expertise of Mr Johnston; and the contrary evidence of Mr Keramidas (2 Blue 686-696) is to my mind persuasive.  
     
      
    32 Accordingly, in my opinion, the primary judge was correct to conclude that it was the impact with the appellant that initiated the divergence of the skid-marks, and accordingly that the impact occurred after the car had been skidding for about six metres.  
     
      
    33 As regards the visibility of the appellant, in my opinion the primary judge was plainly correct to hold that, by reason of the state of the street lighting, the appellant would not have been silhouetted or otherwise visible to the respondent until picked up by her headlights, by which time he was only about 25 to 35 metres away.  
     
      
       
      Application of legal principles  
      
    34 The primary contention of the appellant, which was supported by oral submissions from Mr Walker SC, was that, even on the view of the facts taken by the primary judge, the respondent failed to exercise reasonable skill and care. In substance, his submission was that, accepting that the respondent could not have seen the appellant on the road until she was within about 25 to 35 metres of him, when it was too late to avoid colliding with him given her speed of about 55 kilometres per hour, the respondent should have been travelling at a slower speed because of the particular combination of circumstances.  
     
      
    35 Mr Walker relied particularly on the High Court decision in Manley v Alexander [2005] HCA 79; (2005) 80 ALJR 413, and particularly on the second sentence of par [12] in the joint judgment of Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ:  
     
      
       
        
        [12] …… But the reasonable care that a driver must exercise when driving a vehicle on the road requires that the driver control the speed and direction of the vehicle in such a way that the driver may know what is happening in the vicinity of the vehicle in time to take reasonable steps to react to those events. 
        
       
      
    36 Mr Walker submitted that the circumstance that the look-out and speed of the respondent was such that the collision could not be avoided meant that she was in breach of her duty of care, which required that she keep a look-out and adjust her speed so that she was able to see a pedestrian on the road in time to be able to avoid colliding with him. He submitted that the respondent knew of the inadequacy of street-lighting, and yet did not put herself in a position to be able to avoid colliding with a person in the unlit area.  
     
      
    37 I note that the quoted statement from Manley v Alexander has been referred to and applied by this Court in Vale v Eggins [2006] NSWCA 348 at [15] and [59] and Evans v Lindsay [2006] NSWCA 354 at [38] and [70].  
     
      
    38 I do not of course question the correctness of this quoted statement. However, in my opinion the statement needs to be understood in the light both of generally accepted principles of negligence (there being no suggestion that there was any intention to depart from those principles), and the particular facts of Manley.  
     
      
    39 As regards generally accepted principles of negligence applicable to drivers of cars, these are relevantly illustrated in cases such as Derrick v Cheung [2001] HCA 48; (2001) 181 ALR 301, and South Tweed Heads Rugby League Football Club Limited v Cole [2002] NSWCA 205; (2002) 55 NSWLR 113.  
     
      
    40 In Derrick, the defendant was driving along Victoria Avenue, Chatswood at 40-50 kilometres per hour, keeping up with traffic, when the plaintiff, a child of about 21 months, suddenly emerged in front of her from between two parked vehicles. The plaintiff was struck by the defendant’s car. The primary judge found the defendant negligent, and this finding was upheld by a majority of the Court of Appeal. The High Court unanimously allowed the defendant’s appeal, saying this:  
     
      
       
        
        [11] The submission of the appellant was that the Court of Appeal should have intervened to reverse the decision of the trial judge because there was no basis upon which his Honour could properly hold that there had been any want of care on the part of the appellant. There was no relevant dispute about the facts of the accident and it was common ground that this was not a case which turned upon the impression made on the trial judge by any particular witness or witnesses. Nor was it a case where the incident occurred near to a school or bus stop or other place where reducing speed or special caution in driving might be required or prudent.  
         
         
        [12] The substance of the appellant's contention in this Court is that the reasoning of Davies AJA is correct and that both the trial judge and the majority in the Court of Appeal erred, the latter in particular in effectively holding that driving at a speed which was ""'reasonable' in one sense [did] not mean [that] it [was] not a breach of duty [by the driver] to other road users.""  
         
         
        [13] The appeal to this Court must be upheld. There was no basis upon which any finding of negligence on the part of the appellant could be made. That the facts of the case are tragic, and the collision a parent's worst nightmare, as the trial judge accurately described them, did not relieve his Honour of his obligation to determine the issues according to law: in this case, by not finding an absence of care in circumstances in which reasonable care was, as Davies AJA correctly held, in fact being exercised. Even if the inference which the trial judge drew, that if the appellant's speed had been slower by a few kilometres per hour she would have been able to avoid the collision, was more than mere speculation, it is still not an inference upon which a finding of negligence could be based. Few occurrences in human affairs, in retrospect, can be said to have been, in absolute terms, inevitable. Different conduct on the part of those involved in them almost always would have produced a different result. But the possibility of a different result is not the issue and does not represent the proper test for negligence. That test remains whether the plaintiff has proved that the defendant, who owed a duty of care, has not acted in accordance with reasonable care. To offer, as the majority in the Court of Appeal did, its consolation that the appellant does not bear any moral, as distinct from legal, responsibility for what occurred is to obscure that issue.  
         
         
        [14]  
        Stocks v Baldwin 
        , to which the Court of Appeal referred, depended on its own facts. The observations of Mahoney P were made with particular reference to the facts under consideration in that case. In any event, even if his Honour's remarks were intended to lay down general rules, they were not ones to be applied here. What was unlikely in this case was that an unattended infant of such tender years would dart in front of a relatively slow moving vehicle on a busy road in such a way that a collision was, to all intents and purposes, unavoidable.  
         
         
        [omitting footnote]  
        
       
      
    41 In Cole, the plaintiff became grossly intoxicated and came to be on Fraser Drive, Tweed Heads at about 6.20 pm (at which time it was dark, the month being June). A car driven by one of the defendants in the case was proceeding along that road at about 70 kilometres per hour, the speed limit being 80 kilometres per hour, with lights on low beam. There were no houses nearby and no street lighting, and the plaintiff was in dark clothing. The driver first saw the plaintiff when she saw part of her face, two to three metres away from the front of the vehicle; and the car collided with the plaintiff. The evidence did not establish the whereabouts or movements of the plaintiff prior to the time she was seen by the driver.  
     
      
    42 The primary judge found the driver negligent on the basis that her “speed was too high for the level of visibility or, more probably, that she was not keeping a proper look-out”. The driver’s appeal was upheld by the Court of Appeal. Ipp JA (Heydon JA and Santow JA agreeing) said this at [57]-[62]:  
     
      
       
        
        [57] It follows that it is not possible to know whether, shortly before Ms Cole was seen by Mrs Lawrence, she was directly in front or on the offside or nearside of the vehicle. This is of fundamental importance. As mentioned, the recognition distance of nearside objects under low beam was accepted as being 50.4 metres, and on the evidence the recognition distance of offside objects was 24.8 metres (both being subject to a 10% reflectivity factor). As the onus of proof was upon Ms Cole, the case has to be approached on the basis that she was visible to Mrs Lawrence only for 24.8 metres. This distance, furthermore, has to be reduced having regard to the reduced reflectivity factor applicable. 
         
         
        [58] I repeat that a vehicle travelling at 70 kilometres per hour travels at 19.4 metres per second. Thus, assuming that Ms Cole was visible for say 20 metres, even if it is accepted that a reaction time of only one second should be allowed, it would not have been possible for a vehicle travelling at 70 kph to have avoided colliding with her. This is the case even though, as Hulme J found, when Mrs Lawrence saw Ms Cole she was ""opposite the left hand end of the vehicle's bull bar"".  
         
         
        [59] In any event, simply on the basis put by Mr Hislop, I accept that Ms Cole did not establish that had Mrs Lawrence kept a proper look out she would have seen Ms Cole in sufficient time to be able to avoid the collision. That is, the ""pitch black"" area, the black road, Ms Cole's dark clothing and dark hair, the veiling effect of the lights of the Club behind her, and the remote prospect of pedestrians being at that particular place, combined to set up an acceptable explanation, consistent with keeping a proper look out, for Mrs Lawrence seeing Ms Cole at the last moment. That being so, it was for Ms Cole to lead evidence to show that that explanation should not be accepted. Evidence of that kind was not forthcoming.  
         
         
        [60] I do not accept that the speed at which Mrs Lawrence was travelling was excessive. There was no reason to expect pedestrians in the vicinity and Mrs Lawrence's speed was below the legal limit. There was no particular reason for her to slow down to an even lower speed. There was no particular perceivable risk which Mrs Lawrence should have taken into account but did not. She was driving at a modest speed when there was no particular danger observable; driving at that speed with her lights on dim was a reasonable and a proper response to the traffic conditions prevailing at the time: cf  
        Derrick v Cheung 
         (2001) 181 ALR 301 at 304- 305.  
         
         
        [61] Underlying the reasoning of the learned Judge is the proposition that, ""absent some good reason to the contrary, one is supposed to drive within what one knows to be the limits of visibility and control"". In this respect, in  
        Grove v Elphick 
         (1985) 2 MVR 74, Burt CJ (with whom Wallace and Kennedy JJ agreed) said (at 75):  
         
         
          
           
            
            ""The trial judge appeared to have adopted a principle that a person travelling in the dark must be held to be negligent if he is driving at such a speed that he is not able to pull up safely: that principle rests peacefully in the grave"". 
            
           
          
         
         
          
          I agree; see also  
          Morris v Luton Corp 
           [1946] KB 114. 
          
         
         
        [62] In the circumstances, I conclude that the evidence was not capable of establishing facts from which it could properly be inferred that Mrs Lawrence drove her vehicle negligently. I would uphold her appeal. 
        
       
      
    43 In Manley itself, the plaintiff was struck and injured by a tow truck driven by the defendant. At the time, the plaintiff was lying on the carriageway of Middleton Beach Road, Albany. He had been drinking, and had set out to walk home with a house-mate Mr Turner. The defendant’s evidence was summarised thus in the majority judgment of the High Court:  
     
      
       
        
        [5] The appellant said, in the evidence he gave at the trial, that he was driving along Middleton Beach Rd when he saw a man standing on the side of the road. (It has always been accepted that the man the appellant saw was Mr Turner.) Because the man that the appellant saw was ""moving around a fair bit like he had been drinking"", the appellant kept his eye on him. The appellant did not slow down; he maintained his speed of about 55 to 60 kilometres per hour. Rather, the appellant started to veer to the centre of the road. When he looked back at the roadway ahead of his truck, he saw something lying on the road. He said he ""went to brake … thought I shouldn't brake, so I lifted my foot … and then I felt that I ran over something"". 
        
       
      
    44 The primary judge held the driver not to be negligent. The Full Court of Western Australia upheld the plaintiff’s appeal for reasons stated as follows by the majority judgment of the High Court:  
     
      
       
        
        [9] The principal reasons of the Full Court in relation to the issue of negligence were given by Le Miere J. The steps in that reasoning were as follows:  
         
         
          
          (a) the trial judge made no express finding about when the respondent moved onto the road;  
           
           
          (b) because movement attracts attention, and the appellant did not see the respondent move onto the road, it should be inferred that the respondent was already on the roadway when the appellant saw Mr Turner standing on the side of the road;  
           
           
          (c) the appellant having continued to drive at the same speed, changing the direction of his vehicle while taking his eyes off the road, and having taken his eyes off the road for some two to three seconds, the appellant failed to take reasonable care in breach of his duty to other road users who might, however unexpectedly, happen to be on the road.  
          
         
         
        [omitting footnotes]  
        
       
      
    45 The driver appealed to the High Court. His appeal was dismissed by a majority (Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ) with Callinan and Heydon JJ dissenting. At [11]-[14] the majority said this:  
     
      
       
        
        [11] No doubt the appellant's attention was drawn to the figure of Mr Turner standing at the side of the road and behaving in a way that suggested that he might act in some way that would require the appellant to respond. But recognising one possible source of danger does not mean that a driver can or must give exclusive attention to that danger. Driving requires reasonable attention to all that is happening on and near the roadway that may present a source of danger. And much more often than not, that will require simultaneous attention to, and consideration of, a number of different features of what is already, or may later come to be, ahead of the vehicle's path.  
         
         
        [12] It may readily be accepted that the possibility that someone would be found lying on a roadway like Middleton Beach Rd at 4.00 am is properly to be described as remote. But the reasonable care that a driver must exercise when driving a vehicle on the road requires that the driver control the speed and direction of the vehicle in such a way that the driver may know what is happening in the vicinity of the vehicle in time to take reasonable steps to react to those events.  
         
         
        [13] When driving at night, the driver must take account of how well the road is illuminated: both by the vehicle's lights and by any street or other lighting. In the present case, there was a street light close to where the respondent lay on the road. Its light illuminated the area where the respondent was. Of course, it is important to remember that the respondent was wearing dark clothing and lying down, generally parallel with the direction the appellant's truck was travelling. The contour of the road gave the appellant an uninterrupted view of the road ahead for a distance considerably greater than the light cast by his low beam headlights. The light cast by those headlights extended about 60 metres ahead of his vehicle. The respondent, even clad in dark clothing and lying parallel to the direction of travel, could have been seen as some form of obstruction to be avoided at least by the time the headlight beams illuminated where he was. But the appellant did not see him. For two to three seconds the appellant continued to look to the side of the road rather than to the roadway over which his vehicle would travel and he maintained his vehicle's speed while veering towards the centre of the road.  
         
         
        [14] It was well open to the Full Court to conclude, as it did, that the appellant had failed to exercise reasonable care. In this appeal, this Court's function is to correct any error that has been shown in the decision and hence the resulting orders of the Full Court. It is not, as such, to exercise for itself the powers of the Full Court, absent demonstrated error. The very large discount that the Full Court allowed for contributory negligence on the respondent's part was not challenged in this Court.  
        
       
      
    46 It is apparent that the negligence found by the majority was that the driver looked away for two to three seconds rather than looking where he was going, while all the time maintaining a speed of 55-60 kilometres per hour.  
     
      
    47 In my opinion, in the second sentence of par [12] of the majority judgment, it is noteworthy that their Honours used the words “may know” and not “knows” or “will know”. I do not suggest that, in their context, the words “may know” mean merely “might possibly know”. However, the words certainly do not mean “knows” or “will know”. In my opinion, the best understanding of the words can be expressed as “is in a reasonable position to know”. The standard in respect of the position a driver should be in so as to be able to take reasonable steps to react to events is itself a standard of reasonable skill and care; and although the standard of reasonable skill and care required of drivers is a high standard (because cars are so dangerous, and can so easily cause serious injuries), it is not a standard measured by success or perfection assessed with the wisdom of hindsight.  
     
      
    48 In the present case, with the wisdom of hindsight, it can be recognised that if the respondent had slowed significantly below her speed of about 55 kilometres per hour, she could have seen the appellant in the darkened area in time to avoid colliding with him. However, this does not mean that she was negligent. In my opinion, to say that the respondent was negligent because (i) she did not appreciate that the deficiency of street-lighting, coupled with the effect of the curve in the road and her headlights being on low beam, meant that, in the event that a pedestrian was standing in this darkened area paying no attention to traffic, she might be unable to see him in time to stop or steer so as to avoid hitting him, and because (ii) she did not accordingly slow down to a speed such that, in that event, she could avoid hitting such a pedestrian, would be to apply an unreasonably and unrealistically high standard, and not the standard of reasonable skill and care.  
     
      
    49 Accordingly, in my opinion, the appellant’s appeal on liability should be dismissed.  
     
      
       
      Contributory negligence and damages  
      
    50 Having regard to my view on liability, these issues do not arise.  
     
      
    51 However, I would comment that, if the respondent was negligent, the degree of her negligence and responsibility for the accident was on any reasonable view very small indeed in comparison to that of the appellant. An assessment of 80 per cent contributory negligence was generous to the appellant.  
     
      
    52 As regards damages, there is force in the appellant’s contention that the reasons given by the primary judge were inadequate, especially in relation to future care. Had the appeal in relation to liability succeeded, I am inclined to the view that a new trial on damages would have been necessary.  
     
      
       
      ORDER  
      
    53 For those reasons, in my opinion, the appeal should be dismissed with costs.  
     
      
    54 IPP JA: I agree with Hodgson JA.  
     
      
    55 GYLES AJA: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Hodgson JA in draft. I agree that the appeal ought to be dismissed with costs and I agree with his Honour’s reasons for that conclusion.  
     
      
    56 I venture to add some remarks concerning the decision of the High Court in Manley v Alexander [2005] HCA 79; 80 ALJR 413; 223 ALR 228 because of the significance placed upon it by counsel for the appellant and because of the somewhat surprising importance it seems to have assumed in motor vehicle cases of this kind. There is nothing in the majority judgment to indicate that it was intended to lay down any new and higher standard of care in the driving of a motor vehicle upon a public road than hitherto, or, indeed, any new general principle. None of the authorities relevant to those issues were considered or even cited in the majority judgment.  
     
      
    57 The issue for the High Court was whether the Full Court of the Western Australian Supreme Court had been correct in setting aside the verdict at first instance for the defendant and substituting a verdict for the plaintiff. The contention of the appellant/defendant, which fell for decision appears from the following passage from Manley at [10]: 
     
      
       
        
        “…In particular, the appellant did not contest the findings that he continued to drive his vehicle at the same speed, changing direction by veering to the centre of the road, while taking his eyes off the road for some two to three seconds. Rather, the appellant contended that it had  
        not been open 
         to the Full Court to conclude from those facts that the appellant had failed to take reasonable care.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    58 The ratio of the decision of the majority on that contention is found in Manley at [14] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “It was well  
        open 
         to the Full Court to conclude, as it did, that the appellant had failed to exercise reasonable care. In this appeal, this Court’s function is to correct any error that has been shown in the decision and hence the resulting orders of the Full Court. It is not, as such, to exercise for itself the powers of the Full Court, absent demonstrated error. …” (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      In my opinion it is unsound to regard any part of the discussion of the facts which led to that conclusion as making any positive finding or as laying down any rule or general standard. The case has attracted attention because, as the difference of judicial opinion shows, the result, on the facts, was debatable and, perhaps, surprising. However, as the majority judgment in  
      Manley 
       makes clear, that result was a decision of the Western Australian Full Court not of the High Court.

   JUDGMENT1 His Honour: On 8 October 2008 the offender, William John MURRAY, was arraigned before me on an indictment alleging that he committed 2 offences of resisting a police officer in the execution of the officer’s duty, 2 offences of assaulting a police officer in the execution of the officer’s duty, 1 offence of attempting to use an offensive weapon with intent to prevent the lawful apprehension of himself and 1 offence of escaping from lawful custody.2 He entered pleas of not guilty to each count. A trial then proceeded before me with the offender having elected to be tried without a jury. On 17 October 2008 I returned verdicts of guilty on each count: R v William John Murray [2008] NSWDC 226.3 The first four offences are against s.58 Crimes Act 1900 for which there is prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. The offence of attempting to use an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension is against s.33B(1)(a) of the same Act and the maximum penalty prescribed is one of imprisonment for 12 years. The offence of escaping from lawful custody is an offence under the Common Law.FACTS4 The facts of the matter, very briefly, are that two police officers, Plainclothes Senior Constable Owen and Plainclothes Constable Evans sought to arrest the offender in Chippen Street, Chippendale at about 8pm on 26 January 2007 because they genuinely, although mistakenly, believed that he was in breach of bail conditions. They were purporting to exercise the power of arrest provided in s.50 Bail Act 1978.5 A violent struggle ensued almost immediately the officers informed the offender that he was under arrest. This involved the offender resisting and assaulting both officers. At one point the offender endeavoured to take the pistol of one of the officers in order to use it to prevent his apprehension. He did not manage to obtain complete control of the pistol, however, and that is why count 5 was charged as an “attempt”. In the end, the offender managed to break free from the officers and run, hence the charge of escaping from lawful custody.6 The violence involved in the offender’s struggle with the officers is apparent from the fact that the officers sprayed him twice with capsicum spray and struck him with a baton a number of times but their combined strength, and the use of those implements, were no match for the offender. He ran off, apparently unscathed, leaving them, with all their energy spent, in his wake.SUBJECTIVE FEATURES7 The offender was born in 1980 and he was 26 at the time of the offences.8 He has an extensive criminal history which commenced in the Children’s Court when he was 16. His convictions as an adult include matters of assaulting and resisting police and using an offensive weapon to prevent apprehension. The latter offence involved him driving a motor vehicle at a number of police officers who were endeavouring to arrest him for a matter or robbery in company. I note that when he was sentenced for those matters there was a finding of special circumstances resulting in a substantial reduction in the non-parole period. The total sentence was one of 4 years 9 months with the non-parole period 2 years 9 months.9 On an appeal against the severity of the sentence, Levine J in the Court of Criminal Appeal (R v Murray [2003] NSWCCA 116) said this: 
     
      
      [12] Judge Kinchington was sensitive to the subjective or personal matters involving the applicant and acknowledged that the applicant had shown a genuine resolve to overcome the drug habit that played a major role in the crimes. He took into account how young he was, the broken and difficult home life and upbringing, the illiteracy, the incomplete education and all those matters which reflect the severe disadvantages of the applicant as have been referred to from time to time in other cases in this Court.  
       
       
      [13] His Honour was impressed by the evidence given by his grandmother, Mrs Murray. His Honour found special circumstances and varied the proportion of the non-parole period significantly. He discounted the sentence by 25 per cent because of the applicant’s early plea.  
       
       
      [14] As I have said, he took into account properly so, and in a fair and principled way, the strong subjective material including the applicant’s written apology to the victim. Equally importantly, his Honour gave due weight to the applicant’s rehabilitation prospects but felt in the end constrained to impose the sentences he did because of how serious the offences with which he was concerned were, all of them. 
      
    10 As to those “rehabilitation prospects”, I note that following the offender’s release from custody in respect of that sentence on 1 June 2004 it was only some 4½ months before he was charged with a variety of offences, including another offence of using an offensive weapon to prevent lawful detention. He received a sentence of 12 months imprisonment for that. With subsequent sentences that were imposed, he was released in July 2006. 2 months later he was charged with a break and enter offence, but I have been told by counsel that this was a cold hit DNA matter, with the offence having occurred in 2004. Nevertheless, the fact that he was on bail for that matter at the time of committing the offences with which I am concerned is a serious aggravating feature.11 The offender was arrested for the present offences on 5 March 2007. He remained in custody until released on bail on 9 August 2007. For 5 months of that period he was serving the sentence of imprisonment he received for the break and enter offence. Accordingly, only 5 days of that period is solely referable to the present matter and so the sentence I impose should be back-dated to 12 October 2007, 5 days before he went into custody following the verdicts of guilty.12 I have before me a report by Mr W John Taylor, psychologist, as well as 5 testimonials. I have had regard to the detail of the offender’s background and upbringing that are set out in these documents. It is too lengthy to recite here but the description given in the judgment of Levine J I referred to earlier is apt. Of perhaps greater importance is what the offender had been doing with his life in more recent times. 13 Drugs and alcohol have been a problem for him for a number of years but I note in the report of Mr Taylor it is said that alcohol abuse became a problem in 2007, seemingly after the present offences were committed. Heroin use is reported to have ceased in December 2006 and the offender is presently on a methadone program. Many of the offences on the criminal record are said to have arisen out of drug use and association with inappropriate peers in the Redfern area. 14 Mr Taylor administered the usual range of psychometric tests. One of them, the “Criminal Sentiments Scale – Modified” indicated that the offender: 
     
      
      “has feelings of ambivalence toward authority figures but does not appear to be alienated from them. He tends to view people in authority as being unfair and domineering. He has an above average tolerance for legal violations. He does not admit to identifying with antisocial attitudes”.  
      
    15 A number of events affecting the offender’s family during his younger years may tend to explain his view of people in authority. It may well be the explanation for the offender behaving the way in which he did on 26 January 2007. His response to the two officers was, I accept, influenced by the recent history of his interactions with police. There was evidence in the trial that he was stopped and searched for drugs on 7 December 2006 but no drugs were found. On 18 December 2006 police attempted to arrest him because they thought he was in breach of bail conditions. He ran away. It was subsequently realised that he was not in fact in breach of bail. On 20 December 2006 he handed himself in and was charged with escaping from police two days earlier. He was released on bail. On 22 December 2006 there was an incident in Cleveland Street, Redfern resulting in him being arrested and charged with self administration of drugs and resisting police. He was released on bail. The charges were subsequently dismissed. On 2 January 2007 he was stopped and searched. A CNI check informed police that he was in breach of bail so he was arrested and charged. It was subsequently realised that he was not in fact in breach of bail.16 As I indicated earlier when dealing with the facts, the two officers who were endeavouring to arrest the offender on 26 January 2007 did so because they had been told by police radio that he was in breach of his bail. He was not. This does not excuse his behaviour and did not provide him with any right to act in the way he did. It does, however, provide something of an explanation for his defiance and aggression. 17 The support that the offender has, not only by those whose testimonials are before me but many others as well is rather astonishing for somebody with his history. His 4 year relationship with Ms Svetlana Konakov, who he has known since childhood, is very positive. She describes the period between his release from custody in August 2007 and returning to custody in October last as one of increasing stability in his life. He was in stable accommodation. He attempted to complete a Youth Work course at Ultimo TAFE but by the time it came to submit written assignments his problems with literacy forced him to discontinue. Shortly before returning to custody he had been accepted into a literacy course at Petersham TAFE. He had begun an outreach course in horticulture and was preparing to obtain his driver’s licence. He and Ms Konakov were accredited volunteers at the World Youth Day events in Sydney. They had become active members at their local church. Ms Konakov says that before he returned to custody the offender spent most of his time with her, encouraging and supporting her with her university studies and spending time with family. She confirms his commitment to the methadone program. 18 In addition to a statement of continuing support for the offender, Ms Konakov concludes her testimonial with the following: 
     
      
      “Over the years that I spent with William I have seen him progress from a person who had no support, no stable home, very little problem solving skills and used drugs as a way of coping with his pain, to a man who asks for assistance, has developed a network of people who support him and has begun to trust people enough to talk about some of the traumatic experiences that he has had to deal with in his life. William has also taken steps towards educating himself in order to find a job so that he can be a contributing member of society”.  
      
    19 Ms Konakov might be thought to be biased in her opinions because of her relationship with the offender. However, there is independent support for what she says in the testimonial from Ms Sally Ringrose of the Community Restorative Centre Accommodation Service. It includes this: 
     
      
      “In my experience of working with this client group, rarely have I seen someone come so far in such a relatively short time. William has done this by his own desire and commitment to change, recognising the value of support from others, forming positive relationships and taking responsibility for himself. The Accommodation Service staff view William with high regard as a client for the progress he has made”. 
      
    20 Whilst a review of the offender’s criminal history, particularly the repetitive offending against police officers, paints a very negative picture, the other material before me concerning the progress the offender has made in the last year or so is quite the opposite. Mr Taylor expresses the opinion that “if (the offender) is able to maintain his motivation for change he is considered to have quite good prospects for rehabilitation”. The “if” is the qualification but I am satisfied that his chances for rehabilitation are quite promising.21 It was not submitted on the offender’s behalf that I should find he is remorseful and that was realistic. Usually I am reluctant to make a finding in an offender’s favour that he or she has good rehabilitation prospects if there is no finding of remorsefulness but in the somewhat unusual circumstances of this case I am prepared to do so.OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCES22 I cannot, however, allow favourable subjective circumstances to dominate my assessment of the appropriate sentence. The first and foremost consideration is the objective seriousness of the offences.23 In Sharpe v R [2006] NSWCCA 255, Johnson J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Latham J agreed, said this about offences against s.33B: 
     
      
      [70] This Court has observed that offences against s.33B are to be regarded extremely seriously:  
      R v Hamilton  
      (1993) 66 A Crim R 575 at 581;  
      R v Barton  
      (2001) 121 A Crim R 185 at 191. These observations have been made in the context of s.33B offences committed against police officers. In  
      Hamilton 
      , Gleeson CJ observed at 581 that it was incumbent upon the Court in dealing with offences of this nature to show an appropriate measure of support for police officers who undertake a difficult, dangerous and usually thankless task. 
       
       
      … 
       
       
      [72] General deterrence must play a significant role in the sentencing of offenders for offences contrary to s.33B:  
      R v Perez  
      (NSWCCA, Gleeson CJ, Kirby P and Campbell J, 11 December 1991, BC9101351 at page 21). 
      
    24 I am satisfied that the offences of assaulting and resisting the two officers are in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of their type. There was no significant injury to either officer but that is not a relevant consideration as if there was, a more serious offence would have been made out. It was, as I described earlier, quite a violent and sustained assault and resistance that the offender brought upon the officers. However, a contrast has to be made with a situation in which the person sought to be arrested had in fact committed an offence, more so if it was a serious offence. 25 The offence of attempting to use a weapon with intent to prevent lawful apprehension is below the middle of the range, but not by a great margin. The type of weapon is something that elevates its seriousness – a self-loading pistol with 15 live rounds in it. There was no safety mechanism (although it is doubtful whether the offender knew that). It was in a position where, if discharged, it could have caused catastrophic injury or death to Constable Evans. However, the fact that the offender was unsuccessful in his attempt, and the fact that his attempt was quelled fairly quickly, are matters that reduce its seriousness. This is not to ignore, however, that the experience for each of the officers, but most particularly Constable Evans must have been quite terrifying. Indeed, I referred in my judgment of 17 October 2008 to how he broke down during the course of his evidence from reliving the ordeal. 26 Section 33B includes offences of using a weapon as well as attempting to use one and possessing one, with intent to avoid apprehension. The actual use of a weapon would generally be regarded as objectively more serious than attempting to use one. Further, I am not in a position to conclude whether the offender’s attempt was with the intention of actually discharging the weapon, as opposed to using possession of it to dissuade the police from continuing in their attempt to arrest him. It may well have been, but to take that into account as an aggravating factor I would need to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt. The evidence is not such as to enable me to be satisfied to that standard. The potential risk to public safety is something I have also borne in mind. The offence was committed in a public street at 8pm on a public holiday and there were a number of members of the public in the vicinity. I have also borne in mind that the offence was spontaneous as opposed to premeditated. However, it must be recognised that most offences of this type are committed spontaneously. 27 As for the offence of escape, it is a fairly unremarkable example of its type. As I indicated earlier, it is no excuse that the officers were mistaken in their belief that the offender should be taken into custody. However I feel that it is only fair to bear this in mind when assessing the sentence for this offence. It would be worse if it was the escape of an offender who had in fact committed an offence, particularly if it was a serious offence.GENERAL SENTENCING CONSIDERATIONS28 The statistics maintained by the Judicial Commission of NSW indicate that for offences against s.33B of using etc an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension in the period January 2001 to December 2007, 80% of the 132 offenders in the database received a sentence of full-time imprisonment. Of those, 80% of them received a sentence higher than 12 months and less than or equal to 5 years. The median sentence was more than 2 years 6 months up to 3 years.29 For an offence of assaulting etc an officer in the execution of the officers duty, the statistics indicate that in the same period, 41% of the 34 offenders in the database received a full-time custodial sentence. With one exception, all those sentences were 2 years or less, with the median falling in the range of greater than 12 months up to 18 months.30 For the Common Law offence of escaping from lawful custody the database of sentencing statistics is too small to be of any use.31 I acknowledge the limited utility that sentencing statistics can have in assessing the appropriate sentence in an individual case: R v Bloomfield (1998) 44 NSWLR 734. The variation in factual circumstances, as well as personal circumstances, is not disclosed in the material apart from some very broad information, such as the nature of the plea and whether there was a prior record.32 I have mentioned the importance of general deterrence. Personal deterrence must also be a factor in the assessment of sentence in this case. This is particularly so because of the history the offender has of assaulting and resisting police officers and using weapons to avoid apprehension. No matter what has motivated the offender in the past to behave with defiance towards police, the message must be sent to him that such behaviour will not be tolerated, no matter what the circumstances. 33 After having determined the sentences that are appropriate for each of the offences I have considered the question of concurrence or accumulation. I have determined this issue with regard to the principle of totality. It is appropriate that the sentences for assaulting and resisting the individual officers be concurrent but there be a degree of accumulation of the sentences relating to each officer. This is so that the additional criminality involved in the fact that there were two victim officers is recognised. The sentence for the s.33B offence will be further accumulated. The sentence for the escape will be a relatively short fixed term commencing first with the other sentences partially accumulated upon it.34 I am satisfied there are special circumstances for reducing the proportion of the overall sentence represented by the non-parole component. There are because of the accumulation of sentences but particularly because of the progress towards rehabilitation the offender has made to date and will, I trust, continue if he is assisted by a longer period of parole supervision. Indeed, I have endeavoured to formulate sentences that appropriately reflect the objective seriousness of the offences, balancing them with a reduction of the non-parole component as much as possible in order to promote the offender’s rehabilitation.SENTENCE35 On each: Convicted36 Escape lawful custody: Sentence to imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months commencing 12 October 2008 and concluding 11 April 2009.37 Resist and assault Plainclothes Senior Constable Owen: On each, sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 6 months. The sentences will commence on 12 January 2009. The non-parole periods expire on 11 January 2010.38 Resist and assault Plainclothes Constable Evans: On each, sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 6 months. The sentences will commence on 12 April, 2009. The non-parole periods expire on 11 April 2010.39 Attempt to use weapon to prevent lawful apprehension: Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 12 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 1 year 6 months. The sentence will commence on 12 July 2009. I direct the release of the offender on parole on the expiration of the non-parole period on 11 July 2010. Parole will be subject to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service. 40 That is a total sentence of 3 years 3 months with a non-parole component of 1 year 9 months.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused, Darmadji Darmadji, has been tried before me, sitting without a jury, for the murder of his wife, Siu Khian Ho. It is not in dispute that in the early evening of Wednesday, 21 November 2007 he stabbed her to death in the home unit where she was living at Randwick. Nor is it in dispute that he did so with the intent requisite for murder, that is, intending to kill her or, at least, to cause her grievous bodily harm. There is ample evidence of those matters and, accordingly, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the elements of murder have been established. The only issue is whether the accused has the defence of mental illness. 
     
      
    2 I received evidence in documentary form, comprising witness statements, some exhibits, and psychiatric reports. Among the exhibits is the transcript of an electronically recorded interview with the accused after his arrest. Much of this material explains the background to the killing, which it is not necessary to recite in any detail.  
     
      
    3 Put shortly, the accused and the deceased are Indonesians, who met and married in that country. They have a daughter, born in April 1999, who was eight years old when her mother met her death. Sadly, she was present in the unit at the time of the incident and witnessed part of it. The family migrated to Australia in 2001. The deceased’s mother and sister also came to this country in that year, and in 2007 they were joined by a male cousin of hers. 
     
      
    4 The marriage of the accused and the deceased was not a happy one. It was marred by arguments and, on occasions, violent or threatening behaviour on the part of the accused. Again, it is unnecessary to go to the detail of this behaviour. They separated at the end of 2002. From about mid-2006 the deceased was living in the unit at Randwick with their daughter, her mother and her sister, and a female friend. Her cousin also moved in there after he arrived in Australia. The accused would visit the unit on weekends to see their daughter, and sometimes he would stay overnight on a foldout bed in the lounge room. 
     
      
    5 Of principal significance for present purposes is the fact that, over a period leading up to the killing, the accused came to believe that the deceased was having a relationship with another man. This angered him even though they had been separated, and had not had sexual relations, for some years. The man in question was the manager of a shop where the deceased worked. It is clear from the whole of the evidence that they did not have a romantic attachment and, indeed, had no contact other than in connection with their work. They did not meet except at the shop. From time to time he contacted her by mobile phone, but only about work related matters.  
     
      
    6 I am satisfied that the accused had a deep conviction that they were in a sexual relationship. However, there was no rational basis for that belief and, in the light of the psychiatric evidence, it is clear that it was delusional. 
     
      
    7 In the days before the killing the accused exhibited disturbed behaviour. Among other things, he had an argument with the deceased’s female friend, Anita, over a matter of no consequence. Later, in a conversation with the deceased’s mother, he produced a knife and said, “Lucky you come home early, otherwise Anita would be dead.” He threw the knife to the floor, picked it up, and said, “Two stabs on the neck and a person will be bleeding to death.” He also said, “Only three more days and you will all have your freedom, you will never see me again. …In three days time everything will be fine. Don’t worry about me.” In fact, this occurred three days before the killing. The deceased’s mother made him hand over the knife, and her cousin hid it in the kitchen. 
     
      
    8 On the following day, the accused asked the deceased’s mother to give him the knife back but she refused. He told her that he had tried to kill Anita, but he felt as though someone was telling him not to do it. He wanted to kill Anita because she was not “respecting” him and doing what he demanded. He later said to the deceased’s cousin, “I want to kill someone. If I want to kill someone I don’t want to go to gaol. If we are going to die we will die together. They all look down on me and you watch one day I am going to burn everything.” 
     
      
    9 On the day before the killing, the accused rang the deceased’s mother to ask her where the deceased was. In the course of the conversation he became angry and said, “Mother you should have given me my knife back. One more day and everything will be okay.” He also had a phone conversation with the deceased’s sister in which he inquired about the deceased’s whereabouts. He became angry and said, ”She has run away. Damn it.” 
     
      
    10 It is unnecessary to examine the events of these days, and of the earlier part of the fateful day, any further. It is sufficient to say that towards 5.30 pm on 21 November the accused left his place of employment. He made his way to the unit, where he gained entry with a key which he had had cut from the deceased’s mother’s key. In his recorded interview, he told the police that he had done so because he hoped to catch the deceased pursuing the relationship he believed she was having with the manager of the shop. Upon his arrival, only the deceased and their daughter were present. He directed the girl to go to one of the bedrooms.  
     
      
    11 It seems that he confronted the deceased about the supposed relationship, which she denied. He told the police that he had brought a knife with him, concealed in his clothing. In the event, he attacked the deceased with the weapon, inflicting multiple stab wounds to her head, her neck, her arms, her left hand, and her torso. In the opinion of a forensic pathologist who conducted a post-mortem examination, it was the stab wound to her neck which caused her death. 
     
      
    12 In the course of the attack the deceased called to her daughter, and it was this which brought the unfortunate girl to the lounge room where, as I have said, the violence was still being inflicted. Indeed, she even tried to protect her mother by pulling at the accused’s shirt. After the attack he attempted to clean the blade of the knife and hid it behind the washing machine, before leaving the unit with the child. 
     
      
    13 Later in the evening, the deceased’s sister and her friend arrived at the unit. Upon entering, they saw bloodstains, left the unit and called the police. When police and ambulance officers arrived, the deceased was lying face down in the lounge room and she had died.  
     
      
    14 On the following day, 22 November, the accused was intercepted by police driving in the south coast area, with his daughter in the back seat. After being arrested, he invited the police to shoot him, saying that he had killed his wife because she had a boyfriend. In the recorded interview he gave an account of the killing. Asked why he had not called an ambulance, he said, “I felt confused, I didn’t really think about anything, just sort of get out of there quickly.” In response to questions about the basis of his belief that the deceased was in an intimate relationship, his answers were for the most part rambling and incoherent. 
     
      
    15 The accused has been examined by two respected forensic psychiatrists: Dr Olav Nielssen, engaged for the defence, and Associate Professor Carolyn Quadrio, for the Crown. Dr Nielssen interviewed him on two occasions earlier this year, and produced two reports. Associate Professor Quadrio saw him later on one occasion, and produced a report in which she had regard to the opinions of Dr Nielssen. To the psychiatrists he recounted the circumstances of the killing, and other experiences over a period of time leading up to it, in such a way as to demonstrate a measure of thought disorder, together with delusional beliefs of a persecutory nature. Dr Nielssen diagnosed him as suffering from a psychotic illness, either schizophrenia or delusional disorder, and concluded that he was “affected by an underlying mental illness at the time of the offence”. The doctor thought that the onset of that illness was about a year before his arrest.  
     
      
    16 Broadly speaking, Associate Professor Quadrio was of the same opinion. She thought it more likely that he suffered from paranoid schizophrenia, but added that “the central features” of his illness “are the intense preoccupation with delusional jealousy and in this regard his condition is more like a Delusional Disorder”.  
     
      
    17 Both psychiatrists concluded that he had the defence of mental illness. In his second report, Dr Nielssen put it this way: 
     
      
       
        
        I believe Mr Darmadji has the defence of mental illness open to him, as he had a disease of the mind in the form of a psychotic illness, either delusional disorder or schizophrenia, that gave rise to a defect of reason in the form of the delusional belief that his wife had formed a new relationship. The acute phase of the illness was associated with a high level of anger and disorganised thinking, to the extent that he was unable to reason with calmness or composure about the likely consequences of his actions or that his actions were morally wrong.  
        
       
      
    18 That passage, of course, is directed to the legal test for the defence in the context of the present case. That test, expressed in the 19th century language in which it was framed, is whether, from a defect of reason due to a disease of the mind, the accused did not understand that his act of killing his wife was wrong. That he was suffering from a “disease of the mind”, in modern terms a psychotic illness, is apparent from the expert reports. The approach to the question whether he did not understand that what he was doing was wrong was expressed in a frequently quoted passage from the summing-up of Sir Owen Dixon in The King v Porter (1936) 55 CLR 182 at 189-90: 
     
      
       
        
        The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by “wrong”? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people. 
        
       
      
    19 That test is met in the present case. It is not to the point that the accused attempted to clean the knife and to conceal it. He told the police that he was confused at that time but that he may have done it “to make it more difficult in the investigation”. At most, that conveys some sense that his actions might have had legal consequences. However, it is not inconsistent with a lack of insight into the immorality of what he was doing, which is the relevant test.  
     
      
    20 The accused bears the burden of establishing the defence of mental illness on the balance of probabilities. I am satisfied that it has been made out. That is the opinion of two eminent forensic psychiatrists and, in my view, that opinion is supported by the other evidence in the case. 
     
      
    21 I find the accused not guilty by reason of mental illness. In so doing, in accordance with s37 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act, I have had regard to the legal and practical consequences of that finding. Pursuant to s39 of the Act, I direct that he be detained at the Long Bay Prison Hospital until released by due process of law.  
     
      
    22 I extend my sympathy to all the members of the deceased’s family, who must be deeply affected by this tragic event.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: These are applications for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court by Sweeney DCJ (the Judge). The applicants each pleaded guilty to a number of offences of disposing motor vehicles contrary to s 188 of the Crimes Act 1900. Each offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 12 years. Each offence involved, what is commonly called, re-birthing a motor vehicle by changing the identifying marks on a stolen vehicle with those of another vehicle and then selling the stolen vehicle to an innocent member of the public.  
     
      
    4 The applicant Sullivan was sentenced for six offences and asked the Judge to take a similar offence and a firearm offence into account on a Form 1. As a consequence the applicant was sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment of 5 years with an overall non-parole period of 3 years 3 months. He is eligible to be released to parole on 21 January 2011. 
     
      
    5 The applicant Skillin was sentenced for five offences and asked the Judge to take a similar offence into account on a Form 1. He was sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment of 4 years with an overall non-parole period of 2 years 6 months. He is eligible to be released to parole on 15 May 2010. 
     
      
    6 Each applicant was involved in re-birthing Toyota Landcruisers in country New South Wales between roughly 2000 and 2003. They were charged jointly in relation to two of the vehicles. It is unnecessary to detail the facts as generally speaking the same scenario applied in each case. The stolen vehicle was given new identification numbers, usually registered in the name of a family member and then sold sometimes by an advertisement placed in a country newspaper. False papers were used to prove the authenticity of the vehicle for the purposes of registration or the sale of the vehicle. In all but two cases the vehicles recovered by the police were returned to the rightful owners or the person entitled to the vehicle and the purchasers were left out of pocket. In two cases the applicant Skillin made some effort to compensate the purchasers of vehicles from him. The applicant Sullivan received about $86,000 and Skillin about $87,000 from their involvement in these offences. 
     
      
    7 In the applicant Sullivan’s case there was an offence committed in 2006 when he was on bail for the offences committed earlier. He was also subject to a good behaviour bond when he committed the first two offences for which he was sentenced. These were clearly aggravating factors and were in part why he received a heavier sentence than the applicant Skillin. 
     
      
    8 The matters have a long history. Both of the applicants were arrested in May 2004. The applicant Skillin admitted to police disposing of the vehicles but maintained he did not know they were stolen. The applicant Sullivan refused to be interviewed by police. They were committed for trial to the District Court on 7 April 2005. The matters were first before that court in September 2005. There were numerous adjournments while the Crown served material on the applicants and determined what charges would proceed and how the applicants would be indicted. In March 2007 a trial date of 16 July 2007 was fixed. Eventually there were successful negotiations between the applicants and the Crown resulting in the indictment of 19 July 2007 to which the applicants pleaded guilty on arraignment. 
     
      
    9 The subjective case of each of the applicants was summarised by the Judge in her sentencing remarks as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Andrew Skillin is thirty-one years old. He has no prior convictions. Until he began offending in 2000, he was a person of good character. He has a partner and a baby. He told the Probation Officer he left school at fourteen. He said that learning difficulties affected his literacy and numeracy. He worked as a welder after leaving school. 
         
         
        For the past ten years he has been self employed cutting and selling wood. Previously he worked as a Kangaroo Shooter, but it was said his shooters licence was cancelled when he was charged with these offences. 
         
         
        His referees speak of him as a hardworking man. His parents told the Probation Officer he helped them with children they have fostered. Mr Skillin partially compensated two of the people who had bought rebirthed cars from him and lost them, being Brendan Pitman and Bradley Parker, with substitute vehicles of lesser value as I noted in the facts. Although as the Pitmans are unable to register the vehicle given to them because Mr Skillin will not assist with transfer documentation, the compensation to the Pitmans is of limited value and Mr Skillin’s apparent remorse from those acts of compensation must be so qualified. Apart from one victim who obtained his vehicle back by court order, Mr Skillin’s other victims remain uncompensated 
         
         
        Benjamin Sullivan is thirty years old. He completed year 10 at school then trained as a mechanic. He has worked at kangaroo shooting and wood cutting. Recently he has worked as a mechanic in the mining industry around Parkes and in Western Australia. His Parkes employer described him as keen and reliable. His referees speak of him as someone who helps others. Graham Lancaster of Parkes referred in his reference to Mr Sullivan helping volunteer fire fighters during recent bush fires around Parkes. 
         
         
        Mr Sullivan separated from his wife after he was charged, he said due to the stress of his being charged. He says they remain friendly. His parents are supportive of him. Mr Sullivan told the Probation Officer who prepared the Pre-Sentence Report that his motivation to commit the offences was to make money, though he denied having done so, contrary to the agreed facts. 
         
         
        John Jacmon, the psychologist, said Mr Sullivan is remorseful for his offences and for having caused financial losses to his victims. Mr Jacmon said that after Mr Sullivan was charged he attempted suicide, after which he attended three sessions with a psychologist in February and March 2006. It was after that that he committed the further offence in Count 9. 
         
         
        Mr Jacmon diagnosed Mr Sullivan as suffering from a major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. He said Mr Sullivan’s background indicated depression and anxiety at the time of his offences, due to the rural economic downturn affecting his ability to make a living. 
         
         
        Mr Sullivan acknowledged through his counsel that a custodial sentence is appropriate for his offences. Because of his depression and past suicide attempt he will need attention in custody to prevent him from self harming again. Mr Jacmon said Mr Sullivan needs at least six months of cognitive behaviour therapy to treat his depression and teach him to avoid depression. Mr Jacmon expressed the opinion that if Mr Sullivan completes the treatment and retains family support the probability of his re-offending should be significantly reduced. 
         
        
       
      
    10 In sentencing the applicants the Judge quoted from the following passage of the judgment of McClellan CJ at CL in Mason v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 32 at [19]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        …………………..His Honour sentenced the applicant having regard to his findings that the offences were committed as part of an organised re-birthing operation of stolen motor vehicles. Regrettably this type of illegal enterprise is not uncommon. It inflicts considerable loss on those members of the community whose vehicles are stolen, as well as inflicting loss on any insurer who may have obligations to provide compensation. Being part of a deliberate and organised criminal enterprise, in my view a fulltime custodial sentence was appropriate. Although the applicant was entitled to consideration for his plea of guilty, his prior good character and favourable references, these matters did not displace the need for a sentence which provided both adequate punishment and effective deterrence of others. 
        
       
      
    11 After referring to a number of decision of this Court stressing the seriousness of this type of conduct, the Judge went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The offence is prevalent. When Parliament increased the maximum penalty for these offences to 12 years imprisonment in 2001, Parliament was told that Australia was thought to have the second highest number of vehicle thefts per person in the world. In the previous year, 130,000 cars had been stolen in Australia. It was noted by Parliament that cars are often the second most expensive item a person buys in their lifetime. The rebirthing process makes detection more difficult. 
        
       
      
    12 As to the actual offences committed by the applicants the Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is clear from the agreed facts that the offences were part of a planned or organised criminal activity involving the purchase of vehicles of the same model, but older and of less value, to obtain replacement identifiers, the purchase of car parts. Such as engines used in the rebirthing process, the use of false documents to have vehicles registered, the use of family members to register vehicles so as to deflect suspicion from the main offenders, the renting of a workshop for the rebirthing process and the advertising of vehicles in rural newspapers to attract buyers. 
        
       
      
    13 The applicant Sullivan relies upon two grounds of appeal. The first is that her Honour gave insufficient weight to the utilitarian value of the applicant’s pleas of guilty. The Judge gave him a discount of 15 percent. She acknowledged that the pleas involved “significant utilitarian value” but noted that the “late negotiation and entry of pleas meant that the Crown had to prepare for the trial or series of separate trials, therefore the utilitarian value of the pleas was diminished by their being made at that late stage”. 
     
      
    14 In effect the submission is that, having regard to the complexities of the matters and the delay by the Crown in determining the precise charges to bring against the applicants in the District Court, the discount should have been “at least 20 per cent”. The short answer is that this Court would not generally find that there was an error in the exercise of discretion in choosing a discount of 15 per cent rather than one of 20 per cent, in particular where the Judge gives reasons for determining the discount chosen. 
     
      
    15 The applicant seeks to obtain support from what I said in R v SY [2003] NSWCCA 291 in the following passage of my judgment and in particular the sentence I have underlined: 
     
      
       
        
         
        86. It does not always follow that a plea is entered at the first reasonable opportunity simply because the plea occurs after negotiations with the Crown once the offender has been committed for trial.  
        Clearly there will be occasions where the nature of the bargain struck does indicate that the offender could not reasonably have been expected to plead guilty before the opportunity was presented to plead to some less serious charge 
        . But that is not always so and it behoves the sentencing judge to look at the situation realistically in determining the value of the plea on the utilitarian basis. Nor is it the case that the same discount applies to all the offences for which the offender is to be sentenced and a proper exercise of discretion requires the judge to discriminate between the offences if it is necessary to do so in order to properly reflect the value of the pleas by the discount given. 
        
       
       
      After that passage I quoted from the judgment of Hodgson JA in  
      R v Dib 
       [2003] NSWCCA 117 in which his Honour noted that pleas coming late in the proceedings will have less utilitarian effect and, therefore, attract a lesser discount. 
       
      
    16 I do not understand how the underlined passage of my judgment applies to the facts in this case. Clearly the applicant could have indicated a willingness to plead guilty to some charges early in the proceedings. He did not have to wait until the Crown was in a position to go to trial in order to enter into negotiations. If he chooses to wait to see what the Crown is going to do at trial then clearly the utilitarian value of the pleas is less. He knew what offences he had committed even if the Crown was not in a position to prosecute him for those matters. If the accused waits as a matter of tactics before entering negotiations with the Crown then so be it, but he does not obtain the advantage of the full utilitarian value of an early plea. 
     
      
    17 At the hearing of the application, counsel for the applicant submitted that the Judge should have taken into account that whole history of the matter including the various charges that the Crown laid at different times during the period of the prosecution that did not find their way on to the final indictment. In my opinion none of this history changes the situation that the applicant knew what offences he had committed and what he was prepared to acknowledge whether the Crown had chosen to charge him with those offences or not. It is not unusual for persons to acknowledge to the authorities guilt of offences uncharged against them in an effort to clear the record and, as a result, be rewarded with what is known as an Ellis discount. A discount of 15 per cent was more than appropriate to meet the situation in this case. 
     
      
    18 The second ground relied upon by the applicant Sullivan is that the sentence is manifestly excessive. Complaint is made about the sentence imposed for count 1, the offence in respect of which the Form 1 matters were taken into account, as well as the overall sentence imposed. Her Honour structured the sentences by imposing fixed term sentences for each of counts 2, 9, 6, 7 and 8 with the sentences for the first two counts commencing on 22 October 2007 and those for the later three counts on 22 April 2008. Her Honour then imposed a sentence totalling 3 years for the offence in count 1 to commence from 22 October 2009 with a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months. 
     
      
    19 The submission is that the sentence for count 1 is itself manifestly excessive. I do not accept that submission. The maximum penalty for the offence was imprisonment for 12 years. There was a similar offence on the Form 1. The firearms offence also on the Form 1 was itself a serious one even if it could have been dealt with in the Local Court. The applicant possessed a firearm from which the identifying marks had been removed. Accepting that the offence for which he was sentenced was part of a business that the applicant was operating for a period of about 2 years in re-birthing and selling motor vehicles, it is impossible to my mind to view a sentence of 3 years as manifestly excessive. Clearly her Honour adopted the approach recognised in Johnson v The Queen [2004] HCA 15; 78 ALJR 616 when sentencing for the other offences, that is by reducing the sentence that would otherwise be appropriate because of accumulating them to reach an appropriate total sentence. 
     
      
    20 It is submitted that the Judge failed to take into account the effect of delay upon the applicant in accordance with the principles in R v Todd (1982) 2 NSWLR 517 and approved in Mill v The Queen (1988) 166 CLR 59. The complaint is that her Honour failed to have regard to the evidence of the psychologist, Mr Jacmon, that “clearly supported a finding that the applicant’s mental health problems were at least partly attributable to the delay in the proceedings”. 
     
      
    21 The short answer to this complaint is that there is nothing in the psychological report that suggests that the applicant’s mental health has deteriorated because of the delay in the prosecution of the offences. No such submission was made to the Judge. The psychologist states that the applicant was depressed and anxious at the time of offending and his mental health “took a downturn” after he was charged. Although there was a suicide attempt in 2006 there is nothing to suggest that this had anything to do with delay in the prosecution. It should of course be recalled that the applicant committed a further offence while on bail in 2006. It seems that from his release to bail in 2006 he was in constant employment and in 2007 was working in Western Australia. The references from his employers and others that knew him do not suggest that the applicant was suffering by reason of delay but to the contrary was showing himself to be an excellent employee. This is supported by inquiries made by the officer preparing the pre-sentence report. The treating psychologist in 2006, Ms Gibson, thought that his incarceration would have exacerbated the symptoms of his disorder and led to the suicide attempt.  
     
      
    22 This was not a case where the decision in Todd had any particular relevance. That decision is not authority for the proposition that delay will always result in mitigation of sentence: see R v V (1998) 99 A Crim R 297. It is clearly a matter to be taken into account that an offence was committed many years before sentencing and that over the period of time the offender and his or her circumstances may have changed. In some cases the delay will have worked to the offender’s benefit and he or she obtains the advantage of that benefit in the determination of the sentence. But as I have already indicated, it apparently suited the applicant to allow the proceedings to go on as they did because he was not prepared to plead guilty until the Crown was in a position to go to trial. If he was left “in a state of uncertain suspense” by reason of the delay, see Todd at 519, it could only have been about how many charges the Crown was going to be able to prove. The delay could have been overcome at any time by the applicant admitting to some or all of the offences charged against him. In any event in the applicant’s case any significance of the effect of delay rather lost its impact once he had reoffended in 2006. 
     
      
    23 Reference was made to the decision of this Court in R v Darwiche [1999] NSWCCA 293 and Mason v R [2007] NSWCCA 32 as indicating that the present sentences were in the overall excessive. In my opinion they provide no assistance to the applicant. They are merely exercises of discretion by other judges to specific factual situations much less serious than in the present case. 
     
      
    24 The only remarkable feature about the sentences imposed on the applicant by her Honour was that he received such a lenient sentence for the offence (count 9) committed in 2006 while on bail. With respect, I do not understand how her Honour thought that a fixed term of 2 years was appropriate for that offence or that it should to be served concurrently with the offence in count 2 that was committed in 2002. In my opinion the applicant was fortunate in the way her Honour dealt with this offence and the sentence could have been more severe and yet have been within her discretion. 
     
      
    25 There is in my view no merit in the complaints made by the applicant Sullivan and his appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    26 The applicant Skillin initially raised three grounds of appeal but Mr Maiden SC, who appeared at the hearing, no longer relied upon them. In particular there was no longer any suggestion that the Judge should have imposed a non-custodial sentence as had been argued in the written submissions. 
     
      
    27 The submission before this Court was in effect that the overall sentence imposed upon the applicant was manifestly excessive having regard to the applicant’s subjective case, and in particular his attempts at compensating two of the victims and his rehabilitation over the period of delay before he pleaded guilty. Reliance was placed upon her Honour’s finding that the applicant was unlikely to reoffend.  
     
      
    28 Much of the argument was directed to a comparison of the sentences imposed upon this applicant and the applicant Sullivan, although Mr Maiden eschewed any ground based upon disparity. The applicant of course had one less offence than his co-offender and there was not present the aggravating features that applied in the case of Sullivan. However Sullivan had the issue of his mental health to be taken into account as a matter of mitigation. The applicant’s good character had little significance in light of the fact that he was being sentenced for multiple offences committed over a very significant period of time. The applicant received a lesser sentence than Sullivan and in my view could not have any sense of grievance from the sentencing outcomes, even though the applicant Sullivan could have received a harsher sentence than he did because of the offence committed on bail. 
     
      
    29 In my opinion, in light of the seriousness of the criminal conduct of the applicant in being engaged in, what was to all intent and purposes, a business of re-birthing motor vehicles for profit over a significant period of time, the sentences had to be sufficiently severe to reflect denunciation and general deterrence to a very significant degree. Those matters had to take priority in the determination of the sentence over any acknowledgment of the applicant’s efforts at reform and his attempt, limited as it was, to compensating the victims of his crimes. Mr Maiden acknowledged that this was a balancing exercise. It was one to be carried out by the Judge and I am not satisfied that her Honour got the balance wrong. 
     
      
    30 In case the sentences imposed upon the applicant are used in the future for the purposes of assessing other sentences that have been or are to be imposed upon offenders for like crimes, I indicate my opinion that the sentence imposed upon Sullivan was probably inadequate and the sentence imposed upon Skillin was lenient. 
     
      
    31 I propose that in respect of both applicants leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA : I agree with Latham J. 
     
      
    2 LATHAM J : The appellant, Zlatko Mitreski, was convicted after trial of two counts of Dangerous Driving Occasioning Death (s 52A(1)(c) Crimes Act 1900), each count carrying a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. He was sentenced to two years imprisonment, comprising a non parole period of 15 months, on each count. The sentence for the second count commenced five months into the sentence for the first count and both sentences were ordered to be served by way of periodic detention. The aggregate sentence was therefore one of two years and five months, with an aggregate non parole period of 20 months. The appellant was disqualified from driving for a period of three years. 
     
      
    3 The appellant appeals against his conviction on the sole ground that the verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence at trial. The Crown appeals against the sentences imposed upon the appellant/respondent on the ground that they are each manifestly inadequate and that the aggregate sentence is manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    4 Put simply, the Crown case was that the appellant had driven his semi-trailer at an excessive speed, and in the wrong gear for the relevant gradient, across the path of an oncoming vehicle containing the two victims of the offence. Both the appellant’s vehicle and the victims’ vehicle left the road and collided head-on some distance from the road surface.  
     
      
    5 The conviction appeal, in both the written and oral submissions to this Court, was distilled to one proposition, namely, that because doubt had been cast upon the conclusion of the Crown expert as to the speed of the appellant’s vehicle when it left the road, it was not open to the jury to reject the appellant’s account of the accident. That account, given immediately after the accident and in an ERISP, but not confirmed in evidence at trial, was that the appellant had done so in order to avoid a collision with the victims’ vehicle, which was travelling on its incorrect side of the road.  
     
      
    6 The appellant’s argument seeks to elevate the issue of the speed of his vehicle to a critical one in the trial. Hence, most of the hearing of the appeal was devoted to an analysis of the expert evidence on this issue, with a view to demonstrating that the Crown’s expert opinion (that the appellant was travelling at approximately 71 - 87kph when he commenced to leave the road) was unreliable, and that the appellant’s estimate (that he was travelling at about 60kph) was correct. 7 However, the speed of the appellant’s vehicle was but one of a number of factors upon which the Crown relied to prove that the appellant’s manner of driving was objectively dangerous. Even on the appellant’s case, he was travelling approximately 20kph above the applicable speed limit at the relevant time. Therefore, it is not necessary in my view to re-visit the expert evidence in any great detail in order to dispose of this appeal. The appellant’s argument fundamentally misconceives the nature of the Crown case and disregards other significant evidence, which entitled the jury to reach the verdicts they ultimately returned. The following are my reasons for reaching this conclusion. 
     
      
       
      The 
        
      Evidence at Trial 
      
    8 At about 6:00 a.m. on Saturday 8 October 2005, the appellant was driving a prime mover on the Great Western Highway near Hartley in an easterly direction after making deliveries for his employer at Bathurst and Orange. The roadway had a single eastbound lane and two westbound lanes (lane one being the closest to the southern shoulder). The weather was overcast, and there had been some light rain. The prime mover was towing a trailer, laden with 20 stacked empty pallets and one loaded pallet. The vehicle was in good condition and was free of mechanical defects. 
     
      
    9 The roadway on the approach to, and beyond the scene of the collision was winding sealed bitumen with a medium to steep gradient. The general speed limit was 80 kph, but a speed limit of 40 kph applied to trucks and buses, in addition to a requirement that trucks and buses use low gear. The relevant traffic regulation required a heavy vehicle driver to drive in a gear which limited the speed of the truck, without the use of the primary brake, that is, the foot brake. The appellant’s truck also had an engine brake, or exhaust brake. To comply with the relevant regulation, the appellant ought to have maintained the speed of the truck at or below 40kph by the use of both the low gear and the exhaust brake. The appellant acknowledged that 6th or 7th gear was a low gear.  
     
      
    10 The appellant told police during an interview conducted on 21 October 2005 that he was travelling at approximately 70 to 80kph on the flat at the top of River Lett Hill. The vehicle automatically changed down to the 9th or 10th gear (of 18 gears) as it began its descent and the appellant applied the exhaust brake. He said he did not apply the primary brake because of the wet conditions. When asked about his speed during the descent, the appellant said “I thought I was doing 55 when I come, come down there.” Later, the appellant said the vehicle was travelling at “58, 60 at the most” just prior to the negotiation of a steep (11% gradient) left-hand bend. As the appellant commenced to round the bend, he said he saw a green Toyota Lexcen travelling uphill in the opposite direction, in the eastbound lane. The appellant said he flashed his headlights but the Toyota continued on towards him. The appellant said he accelerated to 65kph in the hope he could move around the Toyota on the westbound lanes. 
     
      
    11 The Toyota Lexcen was being driven by Mr Robert John, with Mr Alan Sandstrom as a front seat passenger. The car had been under observation by a Ms Dalton, since leaving her home in the lower Blue Mountains to drive to Lithgow at approximately 5:15 a.m. Ms Dalton followed the Toyota at the speed limit of 80kph, until she stopped at Mt Victoria for petrol. Ms Dalton saw nothing to suggest any mismanagement of that vehicle.  
     
      
    12 Shortly before the site of the collision, the Toyota had entered a straight stretch of road after negotiating a left hairpin turn with a 45kph speed limit. The evidence of the investigating police was that the uphill gradient and the hairpin bend would have retarded the Toyota’s speed. Beyond that, the evidence was silent, although the Crown’s expert witness assumed a range of 60kph to 80kph for reconstruction purposes. 
     
      
    13 Just before the apex of the left hand bend, the appellant’s vehicle crossed into the westbound lanes, left the bitumen, and travelled approximately 25 metres onto a grassy area, where it struck the Toyota Lexcen. The truck then continued onto a gravel rest area and another grassy area before coming to rest approximately 50 metres from where it had left the road. The Toyota left the road approximately 25 metres east of the point where the truck left the road and travelled approximately 8 metres from the bitumen before the point of impact. 
     
      
    14 The observations made by the police attending the scene and by the Crown's expert, together with a large number of photographs, were consistent with both the prime mover and the trailer braking heavily just prior to leaving the road and up to the point of impact. There were skid marks where the truck left the road on the southern fog line. There were also dual furrows leaving the road surface, crossing the shoulder of the road and continuing through to the grass embankment. The skid marks and the furrows created by the movement of the truck did not deviate, that is, they indicated that the prime mover and the trailer had moved together in a straight line from about the apex of the curve on the eastbound lane to the point of impact.  
     
      
    15 The appellant’s expert largely agreed with the conclusions of the Crown’s expert, but for the extent of the braking and, consequently, the estimate of the speed of the truck when leaving the road. Taking their evidence together, the appellant was travelling at between 60kph and 87kph when the truck left the road. There was no dispute at trial about the point of impact. 
     
      
    16 The physical evidence also supported the fact that the Toyota was travelling in lane one, and that the driver applied the brakes and steered to the left when it left the roadway. The curvature of the furrows made by the Toyota as it left the bitumen was inconsistent with the Toyota travelling across the road from the eastbound lane. Given that the Toyota was travelling west, had it swerved to avoid the truck from the eastbound lane, the marks on the shoulder of the road would have been more perpendicular to the southern fog line than was in fact the case. The appellant's expert agreed that the Toyota was in lane one immediately before swerving off the road, and that the only evidence to the contrary was the account given by the appellant at trial. He further agreed that there was no physical evidence capable of placing the Toyota on its incorrect side of the road. 
     
      
    17 The account given by the appellant to various persons at the accident scene and in the course of his interview with police contained some material discrepancies with the physical evidence. The appellant maintained that the Toyota took evasive action by moving from the eastbound lane onto its correct side of the road and that the point of impact was in fact in lane one on the bitumen. The appellant at no stage volunteered that he had steered the truck off the road, rather his account was that he had accelerated slightly in an attempt to manoeuvre around the Toyota, but that the Toyota then corrected to the westbound lanes. The explanation given at trial for the appellant’s “mistake” about the point of impact was that he was suffering from shock immediately after the accident and had become wedded to that view. 
     
      
       
      The Summing Up 
       
      
    18 The appellant makes no complaint about the summing up. 
     
      
    19 The Crown case was put to the jury in the following terms :- 
     
      
       
        
        Here the Crown alleges that, as the accused drove down what it suggests was a steep hill, travelling in a generally eastbound direction from the Lithgow direction and towards the Sydney direction, on a road which was wet or damp on an overcast day, the accused … drove his vehicle at a speed which was excessive and did not drive in a sufficiently low gear as required by the sign erected under the Australian Traffic Rules. So that it is alleged, in effect, that he was unable to control the vehicle, whether by way of momentary inattention or fatigue, so that it left the highway and collided with a motor car on the rest area off the highway. 
        
       
       
        
        ………………………………………………………………………… 
         
        The Crown case here is that the driving was dangerous in that the accused was travelling at a speed which was too high and in a manner which did not enable him to maintain control of his vehicle. The Crown case in essence is that he, in effect, drove off, or that his vehicle went off the road. The Crown does not accept his version that he did so in order to take evasive action in the light of the risk of collision with a motor car which, he says, was travelling towards him on the incorrect side of the road. 
         
        The Crown does not accept that that was an explanation for the accused leaving the roadway, but that the answer is to be found in evidence which, it says, establishes that his speed was excessive and that, by virtue of the way in which he controlled the vehicle, or perhaps momentary inattention or fatigue, that he failed to properly keep his vehicle under control so that he drove across the road and across the path of the Toyota vehicle, which was, on the Crown case, travelling on its correct side of the road. 
        
       
       
        
        ………………………………………………………………………. 
         
        The Crown case is that to drive down that hill, in a heavy vehicle at that speed and in the gear in which it was being driven, was potentially dangerous to another person or to other persons, the risk being that the vehicle would cross on to its incorrect side of the road and collide with oncoming vehicles travelling in the lanes provided for those oncoming vehicles. 
        
       
      
    20 It is abundantly clear from the evidence at trial, accurately encapsulated by the above extract from the summing up, that the Crown case was not dependent upon a finding of fact by the jury that the appellant’s truck was travelling at a speed of between 70kph and 87kph when it left the road, or indeed a finding of fact that the truck was travelling at any particular speed. The Crown’s allegation was that the appellant was travelling at an excessive speed, and that there were other aspects of his management of the vehicle that constituted dangerous driving. It was open to the jury to conclude that anything above the speed limit applicable to heavy vehicles was excessive. It was also open to the jury to find that the manner of the appellant’s driving was dangerous, irrespective of the issue of speed. In that regard, the resolution of the dispute about the speed of the appellant’s vehicle was arguably superfluous.  
     
      
    21 The trial judge correctly told the jury that if they came to the view that it was a reasonable possibility that the appellant crossed to the incorrect side of the road in order to avoid colliding with a vehicle in the eastbound lane, then the appellant must be acquitted. There was nothing inherently illogical in rejecting the appellant’s account as a reasonable possibility, notwithstanding an inability to determine precisely how much above 60kph the appellant was travelling when he left the road. The appellant’s argument assumes that the speed of the appellant’s vehicle was in the nature of an intermediate fact, which was essential in the chain of reasoning towards guilt. In other words, if the Crown failed to establish that fact, the jury were bound to accept the appellant’s account because a speed of 60kph was, according to the appellant’s expert, consistent with that account. Not only is that proposition unsound, but the trial was not (and could not be) conducted on that basis.  
     
      
    22 Accordingly, the conviction appeal fails. I turn to the Crown appeal against sentence. 
     
      
       
      The Sentencing Proceedings 
       
      
    23 Following the respondent’s conviction on 3 April 2008, the Crown tendered the respondent’s criminal history (for minor summary offences) and his traffic record, which indicated that he had gained his provisional licence in 1981 and an unrestricted licence in 1982. He had five speeding offences between 1983 and 2000, and two negligent driving offences in 1984 and 1985. In January 2007, that is, after the accident, he was convicted of driving using a hand-held mobile phone. 
     
      
    24 Immediately thereafter, his Honour observed that the Crown case was one of driving in a manner dangerous, where there was ""possibly fatigue or momentary inattention"". The Crown Prosecutor responded with a submission that the convictions warranted full-time custody, particularly given the fact that the respondent was a professional driver and the absence of remorse. His Honour did not reject these propositions. Notwithstanding that a full-time custodial sentence was “on the cards”, the respondent was granted bail pending sentence. 
     
      
    25 On 30 May 2008, the matter came back before his Honour for sentence. The judge received written submissions under the hand of the Crown Prosecutor who had conducted the trial.  
     
      
    26 The submissions contained an extensive recitation of the facts said by the Crown to have been established at trial, including that ""the offender continued down the hill in an easterly direction at a speed in excess of the speed limit and in a gear which did not comply with Regulation 108. Whilst negotiating a left-hand curve which was on a stretch of road which is a steep decline, ….. the offender's truck crossed over the centre separation lines on to the incorrect … side of the road"". This was an entirely accurate summary of the facts which was never really contested at trial ; the respondent’s case consisted of an explanation for that manner of driving and that explanation was necessarily rejected by the jury. It was a moot point whether Regulation 108 was breached, but the respondent never disputed that he was not in a low gear. 
     
      
    27 The Crown submissions referred extensively to the guideline judgements of R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252, in addition to the authorities of R v Khatter [2000] NSWCCA 32, R v Davies [2000] NSWCCA 84, R v Dunlop [2001] NSWCCA 435 and R v Romanic [2000] NSWCCA 524.  
     
      
    28 Khatter and Davies both drew attention to the ""shades and gradations of moral culpability"" that exist between the two extremes of momentary inattention and abandonment of responsibility. Romanic was cited as authority for the proposition that a non-custodial sentence for an offence against s 52A should be exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgement. That case was a successful Crown appeal against a sentence of periodic detention, where the offence was not constituted by excessive speed or prolonged erratic driving. It did, however, involve more than momentary inattention and simple misjudgement and was aggravated by a degree of intoxication. The reference to these decisions was immediately followed by the following submission :- 
     
      
       
        
        It is the Crown case that the degree of moral culpability of the offender is high. His handling of the prime mover and un-laden trail in hazardous conditions in a low speed and gear area was morally culpable.  
        
       
      
    29 The Crown submissions went on to assert that the respondent's case was more serious than the typical case, according to Whyte, in that the offender was not a young offender and had a record of traffic offences. Any expressions of remorse were said to be tempered by the fact that the Crown case was strong. The respondent's subjective features, it was submitted, could not outweigh the objective seriousness of the offences.  
     
      
    30 The Crown's submission on the respondent’s moral culpability was repeated, in the following terms :- 
     
      
       
        
        The offender was a professional truck driver of a very large vehicle. He was driving well in excess of the speed limit and in a higher gear than was appropriate to the area in which the collision occurred in weather conditions which exacerbated the hazards.  
        
       
       
      Once again, there was nothing contentious about these matters. 
       
      
    31 Four victim impact statements were read to the court. The Pre-sentence Report noted that the respondent maintained his innocence. 32 The respondent was called to give evidence. He confirmed that when he had seen Dr Roberts, a psychiatrist, he had answered Dr Roberts’ questions accurately and honestly. Of particular relevance to the Crown appeal, the respondent gave this evidence with respect to the accident itself :- 
     
      
       
        
        Question : Do you still, sir, have feelings and emotions in relation to those events or that event? 
         
        Answer : I have feelings for that event for the rest of my life. 
         
        Question : Sir, was it the case that you wanted to go to the funeral of the deceased? 
         
        Answer : Yeah, I asked but the police wouldn't give me the information. 
         
        Question : Sir, is there anything that you would like to say - I am putting you on the spot in the witness box - in relation to your matter? 
         
        Answer : I'm very sorry for what’s happened, I know I'm part to blame but I've got to live with it for the rest of my life, the same as the relatives and other people are. 
        
       
      
    33 Dr Roberts provided a report which became an exhibit in the proceedings. Relevantly, it recorded the respondent’s account of the accident which was the same account given at trial. Dr. Roberts diagnosed the respondent with post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the accident. It was noted that the respondent was provided with three or four counselling sessions at the expense of WorkCover and that the respondent reported a limited improvement in his symptoms over the period of time following the accident. The respondent did not continue with counselling, presumably for financial reasons. The salient aspects of Dr Roberts’ report, which were relied upon by the respondent's legal representatives for the purposes of sentencing, appear below :- 
     
      
       
        
        The management of post-traumatic stress disorder typically includes psychological treatment which may involve group therapy and individual therapy provided by clinicians specialising in such treatment. … It would therefore be appropriate for Mr Mitreski to be referred for treatment to a psychiatrist or clinical psychologist with a view to embarking upon a course of treatment. Specific treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder is typically unavailable in the public mental health system. In order to receive appropriate treatment, Mr Mitreski will require management in the private sector. 
         
        In the event that Mr Mitreski is sentenced to a custodial term, his vulnerability conferred by the persistence of acute psychiatric symptoms, unmoderated as a result of a lack of treatment, will place him at risk. Psychological and psychiatric services are limited in custody. In particular, there are no specific services for the management of post-traumatic stress disorder. In the event that Mr Mitreski receives a custodial sentence it is assumed that he will not receive optimal treatment, causing a further protraction of the course of his illness thereby worsening prognosis. In the event that he is placed in custody, it would be appropriate that his transfer to a correctional centre with access to psychiatric services be expedited. 
        
       
      
    34 In cross examination Dr Roberts acknowledged that the respondent may be treated in custody, but that he did not believe that the respondent would be treated as adequately as he would be in the community. The Crown tendered a letter under the hand of the Chief Executive of Justice Health, dated 11 April 2008, wherein the Chief Executive set out the services available to inmates suffering from mental health problems. In particular, the letter noted that ""a wide range of mental health services are available to men suffering from depression and anxiety. This includes a comprehensive psychiatric assessment by a psychiatrist, ordering of appropriate investigations, ordering of psychiatric medication where clinically indicated, and ongoing monitoring and review of the inmate’s mental health status."" 
     
      
    35 In the course of submissions, the respondent’s counsel noted that the Crown Prosecutor had ""put quite non controversially many of the facts of the case"". A limited number of issues were canvassed in the discussion that followed. The only ones relevant to this appeal are the submissions made in respect of the alleged breach of Regulation 108 and the respondent’s speed. 36 The competing views of the expert witnesses on the question of speed were revisited at length. Counsel sought to nullify the fact that the respondent was, on his own admission, exceeding the speed limit by at least 20kph by pointing to the evidence of the defence expert, who asserted that the respondent’s truck could safely negotiate the bend at speeds of up to 75kph. In the course of this submission, counsel said :- 
     
      
       
        
        Whilst it is conceded by Mr Mitreski by reason of his interview that he was going over 40kph and in fact he was going as fast as 65kph, that itself did not make the driving ... in a manner dangerous. 
        
       
      
    37 Further, when discussing the Crown’s expert evidence on the issue of deceleration of a truck under engine braking, the respondent’s counsel said:- 
     
      
       
        
        [the Crown expert’s] exit speed from the road was about 63 kph which is lineball with what the defendant said he was driving at and lineball with what [the respondent’s expert] said one would expect… 
        
       
      
    38 Taking the respondent’s excessive speed out of the equation paved the way for the submission that ""this is a matter which involved on the jury's finding of the facts and as your Honour would find on the facts, a momentary lapse of attention, momentary inattention, that your Honour would not then be satisfied that other road users were placed at risk.” Having regard to the significance of the respondent’s excessive speed as a factor, albeit not the only factor, in his dangerous driving, this submission should have been categorically rejected.  
     
      
    39 The very last exchange between his Honour and the Crown's representative before the matter was adjourned for sentence to 13 June 2008 concerned the utility of making findings of fact on the question of speed. His Honour noted that the only evidence as to speed (apart from what the respondent himself had said) was ""essentially a product of opinions expressed by persons who are essentially unchallenged as to their general expertise in traffic reconstruction but where a lot of the factors that went to make up their opinions were by no means certain."" His Honour went on to say :- 
     
      
       
        
        it seems to me the jury could have arrived at its conclusion based on the premise that they were not satisfied that there was any truth in the version given by the accused. What they were left with was however sufficient to demonstrate dangerous driving. Namely, driving onto the incorrect side of the road without explanation as it were. … It seems to me it leaves the question of the speed and its influence on the cause of the collision up in the air, as it were, in terms of what facts have to be found. That does seem to call for some independent fact-finding by the sentencing judge. In one sense it was crucial to the opinions of the experts but even if those opinions were left aside .. both sides of the record .. have concluded that it was a manner dangerous, once [they] excluded the alternative hypothesis. 
        
       
      
    40 With respect to his Honour, these comments betray the same misapprehension about the Crown case as the submissions of the respondent’s counsel. The respondent’s driving on the incorrect side of the road was not “unexplained”. Excessive speed and the failure to employ a sufficiently low gear in the prevailing conditions were explicitly identified by the Crown as the explanation.  
     
      
    41 In any event, there are doubtless numerous instances of dangerous driving where it is not possible to determine which of a combination of factors were more causally related to the accident than others, but that does not justify the removal of any one or all of those factors from consideration when assessing the moral culpability of the offender. The Chief Justice in Jurisic at 229B noted that, absent a defence under s 52(8) that the death was not in any way attributable to a factor such as speed, a verdict presumes the causal link between that element and the death.  
     
      
    42 I am mindful of the caution this Court should exercise before finding error on the part of a sentencing judge on the basis of an exchange that has occurred before reasons for sentence are pronounced. However, it is necessary to refer to this aspect of the proceedings in order to understand how his Honour arrived at his assessment of the respondent’s criminality. 
     
      
       
      The Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    43 His Honour began by referring to ""some matters which might properly be said to be non controversial."" They were that the offender was driving his prime mover and trailer in an easterly direction near Hartley shortly after 6 a.m. in the single lane provided for eastbound traffic, which was on a generally declining grade and which was subject to a speed limit (trucks) of 40 kph. On reaching a left-hand kerb in the roadway, his vehicle left the eastbound lane and proceeded across the two westbound lanes and, at a point some 12 m or so beyond the bitumen, collided with the vehicle driven by one of the deceased. The fact that the respondent was driving significantly above the speed limit was not included in this summary of non controversial facts. 
     
      
    44 To the extent that there was controversy, his Honour thought that it had been limited :- 
     
      
       
        
        to a significant extent, particularly having regard to the way in which the Crown case was put to the jury and particularly having regard to directions given to the jury as to the effect of the account given by the accused. The Crown case, as put to the jury, was that this was a case of momentary inattention or fatigue on the part of the driver of the vehicle. And the jury's verdict …. must inevitably be construed for the purposes of sentencing this offender as a verdict based on the Crown case that this was a case of momentary inattention or fatigue on the part of the offender. 
        
       
      
    45 Next, his Honour discounted fatigue as a finding of fact beyond reasonable doubt. His Honour proposed therefore to approach sentence on the basis that the jury’s verdicts were consistent with momentary inattention.  
     
      
    46 This was, in my view, a substantial misrepresentation of the Crown case at trial and hence, of the basis of the jury’s verdicts. As the passage from the summing up set out above at [19] makes clear, the Crown case was that the respondent was unable to control his vehicle because of the combination of excessive speed and inadequately low gear on a steep, wet bend in the road. These circumstances do not conform to the concept of momentary inattention. 
     
      
       
      
    47 His Honour discussed at length during the remarks on sentence the limitations underlying much of the expert testimony. Ultimately, his Honour concluded that the difficulties inherent in the use of a less than accurate plan and the interpretation of the various marks left on the bitumen and the shoulder of the road tended ""to undermine much of the central opinions expressed by each of the experts, particularly as to issues of speed at various points, the degree and process of retardation of the vehicles, and the extent to which there was significant braking and at what point it became effective."" His Honour then turned to consider the level of the respondent’s moral culpability on the basis that ""his manner of driving was dangerous in the sense in which that expression is used in the section, but that the nature of dangerous driving in this case was that he was momentarily or briefly inattentive of his need to steer and drive his vehicle carefully on the road."" 
     
      
    48 After referring to the Crown's written submissions, his Honour acknowledged that there were four factual matters upon which the court “would be prepared to sentence”. Those factual matters were :-(i) the Toyota was in lane one westbound at all pertinent times ;(ii) the truck was exceeding the speed limit as it travelled down the hill(iii) the area of the impact was some distance from the southern fog line 
     
      
      (iv) the prospect of locking brakes in an unladen semitrailer such as that driven by the respondent on a damp road is higher ; therefore more care is required in those situations and exceeding the speed limit is more dangerous. 
       
      
    49 On the question of speed, his Honour said that there was 
     
      
       
        
        no doubt that the offender was exceeding the speed limit which required him, as a truck driver, to be driving at no more than 40 km per hour. His own estimate was that he was travelling around 50 or a little bit more than that at the time he came down the hill and was in about ninth or 10th gear. The requirement, by law, was that he was not only to remain at a speed less than 40 km per hour but that he was to maintain that speed without the use of the foot brake in the truck. 
        
       
      
    50 His Honour then proceeded to canvass the ""significant issue as to the actual speed."" Following a review of the evidence, his Honour said :- 
     
      
       
        
        I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was travelling  
        at any more than 50 km per hour or thereabouts at the time he left the eastbound carriageway 
        , nor is the evidence sufficiently cogent to establish beyond reasonable doubt that the use of the ninth or 10th gear was a factor which contributed to his losing control of the vehicle or driving off the eastbound carriageway of the road. It was obviously insufficient to provide exhaust braking which would bring him within the legal road limit, but whilst that obviously involves a breach of the appropriate regulations,  
        it does not, in the circumstances of this case, establish that his speed was excessive in the sense that it was an unsafe speed for him to travel at in those conditions with a lightly laden trailer on that particular day 
        . In other words, the court must proceed to sentence on the basis that the momentary inattention occurred at a time when the vehicle was being driven at a speed which it could not be said beyond reasonable doubt was itself dangerous and contributing to the vehicle driven by the offender leaving the eastbound carriageway and ultimately coming into collision with the vehicle driven by the deceased. 
        
       
      
    51 The first finding highlighted in bold above is against the weight of the evidence. It was never submitted by anyone, least of all the respondent’s counsel, that the truck left the roadway at no more than 50kph. The most generous estimate for the respondent was 60kph (see [36] and [37] above). The second finding highlighted in bold builds upon the first and incorrectly assumes that an excessive speed must necessarily be found to be an unsafe speed before the case can be characterised as one involving more than momentary inattention. Even assuming a speed of 50kph, I fail to see how it could not be both excessive and unsafe, given that the respondent left the road. The same observations set out at [40] and [41] above apply to these findings. 
     
      
    52 After enumerating all of the aggravating factors in Whyte, his Honour found that none of them applied to the respondent and that therefore, it could not be said that he had abandoned responsibility for his conduct. Ultimately, his Honour assessed the moral culpability of the respondent “towards the lower end of that scale.”  
     
      
    53 It is important to return to what was said by the Chief Justice in Jurisic in order to understand the ambit of “momentary inattention”. The first reference to ""momentary inattention or misjudgement"" in Jurisic at 223 derives from R v Guilfoyle (1973) 57 Cr App R 549 at 552. There, the distinction was drawn between cases falling into two broad categories, namely, momentary inattention and “those in which the accused has driven in a manner which has shown a selfish disregard for the safety of other road users.” 
     
      
    54 The Chief Justice in Jurisic also referred to R v Musumeci (unreported) NSWCCA 30 October 1997, which was “in many respects .. a guideline judgment”. Following the introduction of s 52A, which almost tripled the maximum penalty formerly applying to this offence, Hunt CJ at CL in Musumeci summarised the considerations to be taken into account on sentence. In the course of that summary, his Honour said that where ""the offence is committed even though the offender has had no more than a momentary or casual lapse of attention, there must always be room for a non-custodial sentence,….. but the case in which a sentence other than one involving full-time custody is appropriate must be rarer for this new offence.” (bold not in original) 
     
      
    55 Consistent with this formulation, the guideline promulgated by Jurisic characterised non-custodial sentences for an offence against s 52A as “exceptional and almost invariably confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgement”. Whilst the Chief Justice did not say “no more than momentary inattention”, it is implicit, in my opinion, from the references to Guilfoyle and Musumeci. (See also R v Howland [1999] NSWCCA 10 at [39] “mere momentary inattention” ; R v Dunlop [2001] NSWCCA 435 at [42] “more than momentary inattention”) Next, and most importantly, the guideline went on to state that ""with a plea of guilty, wherever there is present to a material degree any aggravating factor involving the conduct of the offender, a custodial sentence of less than three years [in cases of death] … should be exceptional."" 
     
      
    56 The aggravating factors involving the conduct of the offender are those set out in (iii) to (ix) at 231 in Jurisic, which include, relevantly for present purposes, the degree of speed, and the length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk. The presence of these factors were capable of indicating that the respondent had abandoned responsibility for his conduct, that is, that they were present to a material degree, and therefore exposed the respondent to a custodial sentence of at least three years, given that the matter went to trial.  
     
      
    57 Whilst it may be acknowledged that, in a relevantly similar case, the degree of speed might be so marginally above the applicable limit, and the length of the journey during which others are exposed to risk might be so brief, that the offender cannot be said to have abandoned responsibility for his or her conduct (see R v Bailey [2001] NSWCCA 10), that was not this case. The respondent acknowledged that he was familiar with the road, that he was aware of the danger inherent in driving a semi-trailer above the applicable speed limit down a steep gradient on a wet road, and that at no stage during his descent from the top of the hill (a distance of approximately 500 metres) did he comply with the relevant speed limit.58 The failure to ensure that the truck was in an appropriately low gear, the failure to check the truck’s speed by applying the foot brake at the entry to the left hand bend and the respondent’s decision to accelerate across the westbound lanes were all part of the respondent’s case at trial. Once the jury rejected the respondent’s explanation for those decisions, I would regard the conclusion that the respondent had abandoned responsibility for his conduct as inevitable. 
     
      
    59 Turning to the subjective matters, his Honour found that the respondent was remorseful, notwithstanding his protestations of innocence. The remorse was said to arise out of the respondent’s and his sisters’ expressions of sympathy towards the deceased and the members of their respective families. However, that sympathy was not borne of any awareness on the respondent’s part that he was culpable. Rather, he expressed himself in terms which suggested that he was equally a “victim” of the accident. His Honour erred in attributing weight to the respondent’s expressions of remorse.  
     
      
    60 Before determining the appropriate sentence, his Honour remarked that he accepted Dr Roberts’ evidence that the respondent’s post traumatic stress disorder could not be effectively treated in prison. His Honour then took that consideration into account in order to find special circumstances and in the exercise of his discretion to impose a sentence by way of periodic detention rather than full-time custody. This represents an element of double counting. However, the more fundamental issue is whether the respondent’s condition should have diverted the judge from the imposition of a sentence which was otherwise warranted. In R v Sopher (1993) 70 A Crim R 570 at 573, this Court said :-  
     
      
       
        
        Health and age are relevant to the length of any sentence but usually of themselves would not lead to a gaol sentence not being imposed if it were otherwise warranted. Much depends on the circumstances. For example, a person may have but a short period to live or need intense treatment which cannot be provided in gaol. There may be circumstances where to keep a person in gaol will probably lead to his early death and this would not otherwise occur. The variety and combination of circumstances are legion. An appropriate balance has to be maintained between the criminality of the conduct in question and any damage to health or shortening of life. The Department of Corrective Services has the responsibility of providing for health care but there may be cases where what is required on a permanent basis extends beyond what it can provide and can be expected to provide. In almost all cases what the Department is able to provide will suffice. If gaol is significantly harder for a person because of difficulties due to health and age this would be a relevant matter to take into account.  
        
       
      
    61 There was no evidence to suggest that the respondent would not be treated in gaol. This was not a case where such treatment, albeit sub-optimal, was beyond the capacity of the Department of Corrective Services to provide. The respondent’s condition was not so serious that it justified the extension of the significant leniency inherent in an order for periodic detention. It was capable of giving rise to a finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    62 In my view, notwithstanding the constraints that operate on Crown appeals, this Court should intervene to correct a manifestly inadequate sentence. The respondent’s criminality was only slightly below mid range. A sentence in the order of four years imprisonment on each count, with some slight accumulation, would have been within range at first instance. The least sentence that should be imposed is three years full-time imprisonment on each count. An aggregate sentence of less than three years and four months would fail to reflect the respondent’s criminality for the death of two people.

      20286/2005 – BJ by his next friend Brian Edward JONES v Graham Nathan WILCOX and Anor 
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR:  
     
      
      Nature of Proceedings 
       
      The plaintiff was born in October 2001. On 29 July 2002 he was savagely assaulted by his mother’s de facto partner, who is the first defendant in these proceedings. As a result of the assault, the plaintiff suffered very serious injuries, including brain damage. He has brought proceedings against the first defendant seeking damages for the injuries which he suffered. 
       
      
    2 Default judgment against the first defendant was entered in favour of the plaintiff on 28 September 2005. 
     
      
    3 The first defendant is presently serving a sentence of imprisonment, as a result of the assault on the plaintiff. The matter now before the Court is the assessment of the plaintiff’s damages against the first defendant. The matter proceeded ex parte. 
     
      
    4 Evidence was placed before the Court which satisfied me that the first defendant is not only aware that the proceedings for the assessment of damages were to be heard on 9 December 2008 but that he was agreeable to that taking place. This was made clear in a letter which he sent to the plaintiff’s solicitors dated 19 October 2006. 
     
      
       
      Factual background 
       
      
    5 The plaintiff is now seven. He has a brother Kailum, who was born December 1999 and is now nine. The boys are believed to have the same father but he and their mother split up not long after the plaintiff was born. The father has now denied paternity and has had nothing to do with the plaintiff since the assault. 
     
      
    6 In July 2002 the plaintiff’s mother was living with the first defendant as her de facto partner in Dubbo. On 29 July 2002 the plaintiff was admitted to the Dubbo Base Hospital. On examination on his admission he had extensive bruising consistent with injuries having been inflicted on him over a period of time. He had bruising to the face, the scalp, the trunk, arms, legs and his groin area. He had a fractured skull. He had fractures of the ribs, a collapsed right lung, and widespread hypoxic encephalopathy (brain damage in the nature of a stroke). He also suffered haemorrhages behind both eyes and retinal detachment in the left eye. 
     
      
    7 Because of the seriousness of his condition, the plaintiff was transferred the same day to the Children’s Hospital at Westmead. He remained an inmate of the Children’s Hospital until 13 September 2002.  
     
      
    8 The plaintiff’s mother in her statements to doctors and to the police consistently supported the first defendant. She suggested that to the extent that the plaintiff had suffered injuries, these had been caused by his older brother (who would have been two and a half at the time!). Not surprisingly, when the plaintiff was discharged from Westmead Children’s Hospital it was into the care of his maternal grandparents. 
     
      
    9 On 21 January 2005 the Children’s Court ordered that parental responsibility for the two boys was to be entrusted to their maternal grandparents until each of the children attained the age of eighteen. The plaintiff’s mother resides on the Central Coast and only rarely sees the plaintiff. I am satisfied that the only persons willing and capable of caring for the plaintiff are his maternal grandparents. 
     
      
    10 The plaintiff’s maternal grandparents reside in Dubbo and have continued to look after him and Kailum up to the present time. They receive minimal assistance from State and Federal agencies. They have to pay for most of the plaintiff’s requirements. By way of illustration, the plaintiff is incontinent and there is a cost of $100 per month for disposable nappies. 
     
      
    11 As a result of the assault, the plaintiff suffers from the following disabilities. Severe spastic quadriparesis - this means that he is essentially wheelchair bound, although he can use a walker for short periods. He suffers from cerebral palsy and is severely intellectually disabled. He has limited understanding of what is said to him and is unable to speak. The damage to his eyes has rendered him almost blind. He has no dexterity in the left arm. He is entirely dependent on others for care. He has persistent seizures which will require anti-epileptic medication for the rest of his life. 
     
      
    12 In a sense this exercise is largely academic in that the first defendant has only limited assets. In 2005 he sold a property for $228,000. Orders have been made preventing the first defendant from dealing with that money. In July 2005 the first defendant was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years for his assault on the plaintiff. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      General Damages 
       
      
    13 Because the plaintiff’s injuries were caused by an intentional act on the part of the first defendant, the Civil Liability Act 2002 does not apply to these proceedings. The plaintiff’s damages are therefore to be assessed under the common law. 
     
      
    14 I have already listed the plaintiff’s disabilities. There is no chance of any improvement. He has a life expectancy of 73 years, during which he will have to live with these disabilities. I assess general damages at $400,000. I attribute $100,000 of that amount to the past, which gives to the plaintiff $24,000 by way of interest. 
     
      
       
      Past out-of-pocket expenses 
       
      
    15 I have been provided with a Medicare statement which sets out past medical expenses of $3,275.45. 
     
      
       
      Economic loss 
       
      
    16 Given his age, the plaintiff has no entitlement to past economic loss. 
     
      
    17 In relation to future loss of earning capacity, it has been submitted on behalf of the plaintiff that in the absence of any other information, the Court should use as its yardstick the current average earnings of adult males in Australia. That figure is $967.54 per week after tax. It is submitted that the plaintiff would be entitled to that amount from the age of 18 to the age of 65, i.e. 47 years.  
     
      
    18 In the absence of other information, I generally agree with that approach. However, it would be unrealistic to expect the plaintiff to earn that level of remuneration from the age of 18 onwards. Instead of deferring the amount for 11 years, I propose to defer the amount for 13 years to have regard to the fact that it would take some little time after entering the workforce for the plaintiff to reach that earning level. This means that the plaintiff’s entitlement to future loss of earning capacity is $967.54 for 45 years deferred for 13 years. The 3% tables are applicable and I propose to deduct 15% for vicissitudes. The resulting figure is $727,239. 
     
      
    19 I propose to use the same approach in relation to the loss of future superannuation. I propose to use a figure of 9% on a gross amount of $1,217.35 per week. The resulting amount is $82,351. 
     
      
       
      Care 
       
      Past care 
       
      
    20 A claim is made for 24-hour care at a commercial rate of $47.60 per hour from 13 September 2002 until 9 December 2008, i.e. 6.26 years. Unconstrained by any statute, the plaintiff is entitled to the full benefit of the decision in Griffiths v Kerkemeyer (1977) 139 CLR 161. Nevertheless, Griffiths v Kerkemeyer is predicated on a plaintiff being entitled to damages calculated by reference to commercial rates. For a person requiring 24 hour care, I do not consider $8,000 per week to be a proper commercial rate.  
     
      
    21 The more likely approach would have been either three shifts of eight hours per day, or two shifts per day with an adjustment for night-time when the plaintiff would be asleep and the carer, although present, would be assisting on an “on call” basis. In the absence of an intervener, I have of course not been provided with other costing alternatives. Doing the best I can, I propose to allow half of that which has been claimed on behalf of the plaintiff, i.e. $4,000 per week which amounts to $1,301,559. There is, of course, no issue that the plaintiff’s maternal grandparents have been providing 24 hour care for him since he was discharged from hospital on 13 September 2002. 
     
      
       
      Future care 
       
      
    22 I accept that the plaintiff’s life expectancy is 73 years. The plaintiff’s claim is for gratuitous care for 10 years, followed by 63 years of a fulltime carer paid for at commercial rates and 63 years of care by a registered nurse. The requirement for a registered nurse comes from Dr Buckley. No real justification for a registered nurse is established in the evidence, or even in Dr Buckley’s report. Put at its highest, Dr Buckley opines that there may be a need for a registered nurse in the future but this will not be known until the plaintiff turns 18. I do not propose to make any allowance for a registered nurse. 
     
      
    23 In relation to gratuitous care, the plaintiff’s maternal grandparents are aged 60 and 61. They are both in good health. Provided some housekeeping assistance is provided, I am satisfied that they will provide appropriate gratuitous care for the plaintiff for the next 15 years. Thereafter, in accordance with the recommendations of Rothesay Partners, it seems to me that carers paid for at commercial rates will be required. 
     
      
    24 Applying that regime of care, the damages for gratuitous care for the next 15 years, plus housekeeping assistance for 4 hours per day for 15 years is $3,701,511.  
     
      
    25 For the balance of the plaintiff’s life, a personal carer will be required. I accept the figure of $6,011 per week as appropriate for such a carer. That carer may also require additional assistance from time to time and some additional allowance should be made for that. The cost for a single personal carer paid for at commercial rates for 58 years deferred for 15 years at $6,011 per week is $4,747,765. 
     
      
    26 I propose to allow a further $1,000,000 to make allowance for any additional assistance the personal carer might require over that period. 
     
      
       
      Vacations 
       
      
    27 A claim has been made for vacation expenses on the basis of a fulltime travelling companion in addition to his carer at the cost of $500 per day, plus accommodation and meals. It is suggested that such a person would provide his or her services for four weeks a year. 
     
      
    28 I disallow this claim. The plaintiff’s grandmother made it clear that although they had taken the plaintiff on holidays, he was not aware of his surroundings. In those circumstances it matters not to the plaintiff whether he goes on holidays or not. He will gain no benefit from such holidays. In those circumstances it is not a reasonable head of damage. 
     
      
       
      Case manager 
       
      
    29 I accept that there should be a case manager, independent of the plaintiff’s personal carer. I accept the claim for such a case manager to be a registered nurse or similarly qualified person who would provide assistance for 8 hours per month for the first 6 months and then 4 hours per month for the rest of the plaintiff’s life. The damages claimed for such a manager of $85,305 are reasonable. 
     
      
       
      Future medical expenses 
       
      
    30 The claim has been divided into two parts. There is a claim for future medical expenses to cover childhood and then medical expenses during the plaintiff’s adult life. Some of the components for childhood seem to me to be excessive. I do not see why a consultant paediatric physician should see the plaintiff 4 times per year and why the plaintiff should have speech pathology once per week when it is clear that no improvement is likely. Otherwise the regime for childhood seems reasonable and I propose to allow most of the claim, i.e. $200,000.  
     
      
    31 In relation to the claim for future medical expenses during adulthood, the claim is reasonable and I allow $59,000. 
     
      
       
      House modifications 
       
      
    32 The plaintiff is essentially wheelchair dependent and in those circumstances the modifications claimed are reasonable. I propose to allow those and running expenses. This amounts to a total of $164,000. 
     
      
       
      Transport costs 
       
      
    33 The claim for transport costs is predicated on a new wheelchair accessible vehicle being purchased every 5 years. This assumes a very high rate of usage which is not made out on the evidence. A more realistic regime would involve the replacement of a wheelchair accessible vehicle every 10 years. Using that approach, I propose to allow $584,500. This covers the capital cost of a replacement vehicle every 10 years, wheelchair conversion costs every 10 years and the standing maintenance and running costs for the next 73 years. 
     
      
       
      Computer 
       
      
    34 I am satisfied that despite his very extensive disabilities, a computer would be of some assistance to the plaintiff. I do not see why the plaintiff would need to have the computer and software replaced every 4 years. I propose to allow an initial setup cost of $4,000 and thereafter $500 per year, i.e. $19,000 in total. 
     
      
       
      Funds management 
       
      
    35 This presents a difficulty in that it is most unlikely that there will be any funds to manage, other than the proceeds of sale of the first defendant’s house of $228,000. Nevertheless, some allowance should be made. I propose to allow $50,000. 
     
      
    36 The total of damages which I assess in favour of the plaintiff is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         General damages 
         $ 400,000.00 
         
         
         Interest on general damages 
         $ 24,000.00 
         
         
         Past out of pocket expenses 
         $ 3,275.45 
         
         
         Economic loss 
         $ 727,239.00

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: On 2 October 2007, the appellant pleaded not guilty to a charge that he on 26 August 2004 at Manly in the state of New South Wales did have sexual intercourse with [the complainant] without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting.  
     
      
    2 The appellant was tried before Charteris DCJ and a jury. It was accepted by the appellant that sexual intercourse had occurred between him and the complainant. The only issues at the trial were whether or not the complainant consented to the sexual intercourse and/or whether the appellant knew that she was not consenting or was reckless as to that matter.  
     
      
    3 On 11 October 2007, the jury returned a verdict of guilty. The appellant was sentenced on 25 January 2008 to a minimum period of imprisonment of one year and ten months, and an additional or parole period of one year and eight months.  
     
      
    4 The appellant appeals from his conviction.  
     
      
       
      Crown case  
      
    5 The complainant gave evidence that on the night of 25 August 2004 she went out in Manly with her friend CM. They ate some food at a restaurant and shared a bottle of wine. At about 9pm, they went to the Wharf Bar where she drank two vodka lime and bitters. At about 10.30pm they went to the New Brighton Hotel, and she drank another vodka lime and bitters. At about 12.10am, they went upstairs to the Shark Bar, where they danced and she had a sip of a strawberry cocktail. They met up with a friend LP, and the three then went to the Ivanhoe Hotel at about 1.30am.  
     
      
    6 There the complainant met Daniel Mullins, a younger brother of the appellant, who also pointed out another brother Nigel Mullins. Daniel Mullins bought the complainant a vodka drink.  
     
      
    7 The complainant had patchy recollection of what happened thereafter until she woke up in a bed in a room at the nearby Steyne Hotel; although she did have some recollection of being in a room with a number of people including the appellant’s brothers and a young woman.  
     
      
    8 The complainant agreed that CCTV footage showed her entering the Base Bar of the Ivanhoe with CM and LP at around 3.04am, and showed her leaving the Base Bar alone at around 3.40am. She also agreed that CCTV footage showed her entering the foyer of the Steyne Hotel with Daniel Mullins and kissing him there (at around 4.05am to 4.26am). She did not remember kissing him, but said that she knew they kissed because she knew she liked him and had seen the CCTV footage.  
     
      
    9 The complainant remembered being in a room in the Steyne Hotel, in which she said there were two single beds, with the appellant’s brothers and others. She remembered sitting on one of the beds (in fact, this was a double bed), next to Daniel Mullins. She remembered lying down to sleep, and that she was then fully clothed. In cross-examination, she said she did not remember Daniel Mullins lying down, kissing her, and inserting his finger into her vagina; and she denied that he had removed her jeans.  
     
      
    10 The complainant’s next memory was of waking up in the same bed. Her jeans, pantyhose and underwear were between her ankles and knees, and a male person (the appellant), who the complainant said she had never seen before, was to her right, lying on his side with his legs underneath hers; and this person’s penis was inside her vagina and he was moving back and forth. She said “What the fuck are you doing? Who are you?” She hit him twice, and he stopped moving and withdrew his penis.  
     
      
    11 Daniel Mullins was on the other side of the bed at the time. He woke up and was angry, and he smashed something made of glass.  
     
      
    12 The complainant said she felt semen running out of her vagina onto the bed-sheets. She hid her face under the bed-sheet and started crying. She pulled on her underwear, stockings and jeans while under her sheet. She then ran out of the room. Daniel Mullins followed her into the hotel foyer (where they were shown on CCTV footage at 6.24am to 6.28am), and out into the street. He asked her if she was OK, and she said “No your friend just raped me”.  
     
      
    13 The complainant then walked to her hotel room and told her friend AG that she had just been raped. AG corroborated this evidence, and AG and CM gave evidence that the complainant was very distressed. AG called the police. The complainant was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital.  
     
      
    14 In cross-examination, the complainant denied that she had engaged in any kissing or physical contact with the appellant, and maintained that her first knowledge of sexual activity with him was when she woke up.  
     
      
    15 Dr Stalley, who examined the complainant at Royal North Shore Hospital at 11am on 26 August 2004, gave evidence that the complainant had given a tearful account of what had happened, including that she had gone to sleep fully dressed with one of the men also fully dressed, and had woken up to find her knickers, tights and pants off and another male with his penis in her vagina. Urine and blood samples were taken from the complainant.  
     
      
    16 An analytical certificate showed no drugs in the complainant’s blood, and a blood alcohol reading of 0.054. A pharmacologist, Judith Perl, gave evidence to the effect that at 4am the complainant’s blood alcohol reading would have been probably around 0.178, and that at 6.15am it probably would have been about 0.144. She gave evidence that at a level of 0.1 a person would be impaired in their judgment and decision-making, and also that memory would be impaired if it were something attempted to be stored whilst intoxicated, though it was more likely that an event would be remembered if it had more of an impact on the individual.  
     
      
    17 DNA recovered from the complainant’s vulval swab had the same profile as the appellant’s DNA.  
     
      
    18 Senior Constable Shelley gave evidence that the appellant attended Gosford Police Station on 18 October 2006; and that in response to the complainant’s allegation that she woke up to find a male having sexual intercourse with her, the appellant said “she must sleep with her eyes wide open”. Otherwise, the appellant exercised his right to silence. Senior Constable Shelley also gave evidence that the appellant had no criminal record.  
     
      
    19 Daniel Mullins gave evidence of meeting the complainant at the Ivanhoe Hotel and buying her a drink. He later found her slumped against a building on the Corso. He invited her to enter the Steyne Hotel, which she did, and they kissed in the foyer. He said he would get condoms from a dispenser in the male toilet, and did so. They went to room 16 at the hotel which was booked for the appellant and his friend Stephen Hogg. They kissed on the double bed, he removed some of his and her clothing, and fooled around. He placed his finger in her vagina and could not achieve an erection. At some stage, the appellant entered the room, and then left; and later the appellant threw chips and dirt through a window into the room.  
     
      
    20 Daniel Mullins gave evidence that the appellant later entered the room again, turned on the TV, and was talking to the complainant. Daniel then fell asleep and woke to hear the complainant moaning apparently in sexual pleasure. He jumped to his feet and said “what do you think you are doing” and left the room. He denied that the complainant said to him in the foyer of the hotel that she’d been raped.  
     
      
    21 Leave was given to the Crown to cross-examine him; and he agreed that he had said in a previous statement that the complainant had fallen into a pretty deep sleep before the appellant had re-entered the room.  
     
      
    22 Stephen Hogg gave evidence that he went to sleep in the room; and that when he woke up he heard pleasurable moaning from a female and could see the complainant kissing the appellant. He said that when Daniel Mullins woke up he swore and smashed the lamp beside the bed. He also gave evidence that the complainant was crying afterwards.  
     
      
    23 Nigel Mullins gave evidence that he came into the room after the incident, and that the complainant was sitting on the bed looking confused.  
     
      
    24 The Crown also put into evidence transcripts of a number of telephone calls intercepted in September 2006 between Daniel Mullins and the appellant. The effect of three calls made on 21 September 2006 was adequately summarised as follows in the Crown submissions:  
     
      
       
        
        First call at 10:24, 21 September 2006:  
         
         
        i. Daniel Mullins said to the appellant that he told police she was moaning and had grabbed the appellant's hand.  
         
         
        ii. The appellant said that he didn't want to tell police that he was smashed on drugs. Daniel Mullins said that he knew that and had just said the appellant was pretty drunk.  
         
         
        iii. The appellant said he would just say that he was cuddling her, he wouldn't say that he wasn't touching anything sexual (Daniel interrupted to say ""Oh well you weren't""), that he just jumped into bed to cuddle her and that he was fully clothed.  
         
         
        iv. The appellant said that he would just say that he didn't do anything.  
         
         
         
        Second call at 14:02, 21 September 2006:  
         
         
        v. Daniel Mullins asked the appellant if he had ""rooted her"". The appellant denied that he had.  
         
         
        vi. Daniel Mullins said that the police told him she had semen inside her and he had to do a DNA test.  
         
         
        vii. The appellant said he didn't know if she had clothes on because he was on top of the covers. Daniel Mullins said that was what he had said, plus he said the appellant had his belt and jeans on.  
         
         
         
        Third call at 19:02, 21 September 2006:  
         
         
        viii. They discussed what Hogg had said to police, that he was asleep for most of it but just heard moaning which woke him up.  
         
         
        ix. Daniel Mullins again asked the appellant if he had ""rooted her"". The appellant said he was just doing other stuff.  
         
         
        x. Daniel Mullins confirmed that the police said she had 'sperm' inside her. The appellant said that she had her hand on him and that was about it. Daniel Mullins said he didn't know whether to say that or not.  
         
         
        xi. The appellant confirmed that she had grabbed it [his penis] and said she had started getting on to him.  
         
         
        xii. Again Daniel Mullins said to the appellant that there was no way he could have rooted her. The appellant said that the position was too awkward.  
         
         
        xiii. Daniel Mullins said he told police that both [the complainant] and the appellant were on their backs when he woke up and he heard a ""pleasurable moan"".  
        
       
       
      Appellant’s case  
      
    25 The appellant gave evidence that he went into the hotel room at a time when Daniel, the complainant and Hogg were there. Daniel and the complainant were in the double bed. The appellant then started to bounce on the bed and turn the television up loud. He told the complainant to move over so he could sit back in the bed. They had a conversation and began kissing.  
     
      
    26 The appellant gave evidence that they were soon lying down facing each other and he put his fingers inside her vagina, rubbed her breasts and kissed her. She started to masturbate him and was rubbing his penis around her vagina. He partially penetrated her vagina with his penis. He was on his back and she was partially lying on top of him. He was about to ejaculate and stopped himself so that they could continue, because they had only been going for a couple of minutes. She was moving his hips towards his finger and getting louder with her sexual noises. She had been making these noises the whole time he was touching her. The noises were pleasurable moaning.  
     
      
    27 The appellant gave evidence that Daniel woke up and said words to the effect “what the fuck are you two doing?”. The appellant denied anything was happening. Daniel hit the lamp and left. He followed Daniel. He pulled his pants up as he got up.  
     
      
    28 The appellant denied seeing the complainant’s pants or stockings or underwear because they were all off. He said he did not move back and forth at any stage. He denied that the complainant said anything to him afterwards or punched him away.  
     
      
    29 The appellant said that he had denied having sexual intercourse in the intercepted telephone calls because he was embarrassed to tell his brother and he was afraid his wife would find out.  
     
      
    30 The appellant denied that he had initiated sex with the complainant.  
     
      
       
      Ground of Appeal  
      
    31 The appellant relied on one ground of appeal only, namely that the conviction was unsafe and unsatisfactory in that the evidence was insufficient to support a conviction.  
     
      
       
      Submissions  
      
    32 Mr Glissan QC for the appellant submitted that the complainant was unable to give evidence as to the sexual intercourse. Her evidence was that, after a point of time at which she had voluntarily gone to a hotel room with the brother of the appellant and others, she had no recollection of events until she became aware that the appellant had penetrated her vaginally.  
     
      
    33 In the circumstances, Mr Glissan submitted that there was no evidence that she did not consent, nor was there evidence from which want of consent could properly be inferred. There was no evidence that could give rise to a conclusion to the requisite standard that the appellant knew or ought to have known that the complainant was not consenting. There was no evidence of behaviour indicating want of consent and no evidence of resistance or reluctance. There was no admission by the appellant beyond the fact of intercourse.  
     
      
    34 Mr Glissan submitted that the unreliability of the complainant’s evidence was confirmed by her evidence that she was not aware of anyone taking off her clothes. There was no injury corroborative of the Crown case. The essence of the complainant’s evidence was that she knew she had not consented, but she could not remember. Mr Glissan submitted that it was not possible to conclude that the complainant did not consent to sexual intercourse; and it was not open to infer that she communicated any lack of consent in such a way as to make the appellant aware of it or to make him reckless as to whether or not she was consenting.  
     
      
    35 Mr Glissan submitted that the use of the telephone intercepts was limited to use in their effect on the credibility of the appellant and Daniel, and not as any independent support of the Crown case by reason of consciousness of guilt or otherwise.  
     
      
    36 Even accepting that the complainant did respond as she said she did when becoming fully conscious, this was consistent with her having consented but becoming upset at what was happening or with her becoming upset because she had no recollection of what had previously happened. It could not establish beyond reasonable doubt that the complainant did not consent and that the appellant knew she did not consent or was reckless as to whether she consented.  
     
      
       
      Decision  
      
    37 As put on behalf of the Crown, the onus is on the appellant to demonstrate that the verdict of guilty is “unreasonable and cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence” in terms of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The ultimate question for determination is “whether the Court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty”: M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 494-495. This was a case where the benefit that the jury had of seeing the witnesses, including the complainant and the appellant, and of assessing their evidence, was a considerable advantage.  
     
      
    38 In my opinion, it was clearly open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that, despite the complainant being substantially affected by alcohol and despite gaps in her recollection of earlier events, the complainant’s recollection of events from about the time sexual activity ceased was good. It is clear that soon afterwards, the complainant complained to AG that she had been raped, and AG and CM confirmed that she was highly distressed and upset; and it is clear that since then her complaints have been consistent.  
     
      
    39 In my opinion it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she made a similar complaint to Daniel in the street outside the Steyne Hotel, and that shortly after sexual activities ceased she was crying (as confirmed by the evidence of Stephen Hogg).  
     
      
    40 In all these circumstances, it was open to the jury to be satisfied that the complainant did, as she said, wake up and find the appellant having sexual intercourse with her, and immediately protest and hit him, causing him to stop.  
     
      
    41 Mr Glissan accepted that it was open to the jury to reject the evidence of the appellant, and the sworn evidence of Daniel Mullins, having regard to the intercepted telephone conversations, and also having regard to the complainant’s evidence of what happened from around the time sexual activity ceased.  
     
      
    42 However, his submission was that this still left the prosecution with the burden of showing on the basis of the complainant’s evidence, beyond reasonable doubt, that the complainant did not consent to the sexual intercourse with the appellant and that the appellant knew she was not consenting. The complainant’s evidence, Mr Glissan submitted, was not capable of doing this, having regard to her very blurred and patchy recollection of what had happened between the time she was with Daniel Mullins in the Ivanhoe Hotel (about 2am) and the time she woke up (about 6am). The defects of her recollection are shown particularly by the circumstance that she had no recollection of kissing Daniel Mullins, and no recollection of her jeans, pantyhose and underwear being removed.  
     
      
    43 However, the complainant did give evidence that in the hotel room she was “really tired and sort of sleepy and drowsy” and that she lay down on the bed; that Daniel was nudging her saying “don’t fall asleep, don’t fall asleep”; that then she did not recall anything else before she woke up; and that it was light when she woke up, while when she went to sleep it was dark.  
     
      
    44 In my opinion, notwithstanding the gaps in the complainant’s recollection, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she did not consent to the sexual intercourse with the appellant, because she was asleep when that sexual intercourse was commenced. It is true that the complainant had not remembered kissing David Mullins, so that there is some force in the submission that she may not have remembered consenting to sexual intercourse. However, the jury, having the advantage of observing the complainant giving evidence, could reasonably have discerned a significant difference between the two situations, in circumstances where the complainant said she knew she liked Daniel and acknowledged that she kissed him, but was adamant that she did not consent to sexual intercourse with a person she said she had not seen before; and so, particularly having regard to her evidence that she went to sleep and woke up in the circumstances she described, the jury could reasonably have been satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that she did not consent to sexual intercourse with the appellant.  
     
      
    45 In my opinion, it was also open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant knew the complainant was not consenting or was reckless as to whether or not she was consenting, because that could be inferred from the circumstance that the complainant was asleep. Further, the jury was entitled to reject, beyond reasonable doubt, the appellant’s own account, which was of initiation of the sexual activity by the complainant, and thus was supportive of actual and active consent, and not at all supportive of a mistaken belief that there was consent when there was not.  
     
      
    46 In my opinion also, although this is not necessary for my decision, that there was evidence capable of satisfying the jury of these things beyond reasonable doubt is further confirmed by Daniel’s original statement to the police that the complainant had fallen into a pretty deep sleep before the appellant came into the room and sat on the bed. Although the matter was not explored below, and it was not put to the jury in those terms, this statement was in my opinion admissible firsthand hearsay, pursuant to s 66 of the Evidence Act 1995, having been made in September 2004 when the events were fresh in Daniel’s memory.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion  
      
    47 For those reasons, in my opinion the appeal against conviction should be dismissed.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: Hussein Taoube appears for sentence today on three offences involving armed robbery or being armed with intent to rob. These three offences were committed over a relatively short period when Mr Taoube was under the influence of drugs. When I say under the influence, what I mean is that the motivation for the offences was to get money so that Mr Taoube could buy drugs to feed the addiction. The offences were all very serious, in particular one I will shortly describe, where the shopkeeper was present with both his wife and two young children. 2 The offender pleaded guilty in this court to two of the matters and pleaded guilty in the Local Court, and was committed for sentence on the remainder. I will deal with the facts, not in chronological order, but in the order in which the matters were presented to me.3 The first offence was committed on 17 April 2000. On that day, the offender went to a service station in Tempe. He selected a drink and asked for a Vodafone recharge. When the shopkeeper asked for the money, the offender produced a knife, saying to the shopkeeper “Give me whatever you have in the register.” The shopkeeper then did two things. He tried to hit the panic button and he picked up a blue baseball bat. He held that at his side. The offender grabbed the drink bottle and ran away, hopping into a getaway car that was positioned in the service station. He had previously filled up the petrol too. So the offender thus committed an offence of being armed with intent to rob. He also stole the Gatorade and the petrol. Those two matters appear on a Form 1 attached to the substantive offence. They are part and parcel very much of the substantive offence, and no extra punishment is appropriate. The offender was arrested a few days later. He denied, however, being the person who was identified in closed-circuit television footage committing the offence, and continued that denial until he appeared for trial in this court, when he eventually pleaded guilty.4 The next offence is the most serious. It was committed on 9 March 2007. On this occasion, the offender went to a convenience store in Petersham. It was about 9.45pm on 9 March 2007. Behind the counter were not only the shopkeeper but his wife and their two children. One was six months old and one was three years old. The offender was with another person, both of whom were armed with knives. They clearly went into the store intending to rob the shopkeeper. One might have thought that the fact that the shopkeeper was present with not only his wife but also their very young children might have caused the offender to change his mind. The fact that he did not, the fact that he proceeded to commit the offence despite those circumstances I have just referred to, says a lot about the criminality of the offender.5 What happened was that both the offender and another man pretended to be interested in sunglasses and cigarettes. They paid for those items, and when the shopkeeper had opened the cash register in order to put the money into the till, both the offender and his associate pulled out their knives. The shopkeeper, as the facts record, immediately began to fear for the safety of his family. His wife started to scream out and the shopkeeper tried to ring triple-0. Instead of running away, as they should have done, both of the males then began to wave their knives around and the offender said to the shopkeeper, “Hang up the phone.” He said to them, “Take anything you want but don’t hurt my family.”  So the offender grabbed the cash register and pulled it from the counter. He and his co-offender then ran from the shop.6 They got into a car driven by a man by the name of Yussef. A short time later someone dumped the till in a garbage bin. When the till was discovered and fingerprints were taken from it, a fingerprint of the offender was located, as well as that of Mr Yussef. I should mention now that Mr Yussef was sentenced by Judge Walmsley for being an accessory after the fact to an offence of armed robbery. He received a suspended sentence of eighteen months. The principles of parity, of course, apply, but there are substantial differences both in the offence for which Mr Yussef was sentenced and also the facts on which he was sentenced. It is to be noted that, perhaps consistent with the nature of the offence to which he pleaded guilty, there was no reference in the facts tendered in his case about the circumstance that the shopkeeper was accompanied by his wife and young children.7 The final charge for which the offender is to be sentenced is an offence which he committed on 18 April. This time he went to a tobacco store in Pitt Street in the city. Again, he was with another person and again he was armed with a knife. He began by saying in Lebanese Arabic, “Don’t do anything stupid, you owe someone $20,000.”  The shopkeeper understood what he was saying, and expressed some surprise at what had been said to him. It was at this stage that the offender removed his knife and said, “Don’t do anything stupid, open the fucking till and empty your pockets.” The shopkeeper opened the till. The offender reached over and took about $200 from it. He and the other offender then ran out of the store and got into a getaway car before driving away. He was identified as being the offender in a line-up which was held some time later.8 The offender has a criminal history. He has only been to gaol on one occasion before. He is now thirty-two years of age and has been regularly committing offences for some time now. His family, and in particular his father, have done all that they could to assist the offender to rehabilitate himself. When he was getting in with the wrong crowd, they even sent him away to Lebanon so that he could be taken away from the environment in which he was taking drugs and committing offences. Whilst over there he was conscripted into the Lebanese army, he having been born in Lebanon and coming to Australia when he was very young.9 His father has made other efforts too to deal with his son’s drug problem. He is the only member of his family to be in trouble with the law and he retains to this day the support and love of his family. They are a close family and as I said his father has made many attempts over the years to help his son, all to no avail. He gave evidence before me today as to the difference between his son in March/April 2007 and his son as he is today, after having been in custody for a lengthy period of time, presumably not using drugs. He looked healthier, said his father, has better colour and has put on some weight. It is clear that as I mentioned at the outset of these remarks the offender’s crimes are related to his addiction to drugs. That is not a mitigating factor, however. It is relevant to the prospects of the offender’s rehabilitation. It is clear and recognised by the offender that if he wants to avoid committing further offences he needs to avoid taking drugs.10 There are prospects of rehabilitation. The offender I am satisfied genuinely desires to rehabilitate. However, I cannot say that his prospects of rehabilitation are good or that he is unlikely to re-offend. Much of course will depend on how he goes upon his release from custody. The need for him to be supervised upon his release, or at least the desirability of him being supervised upon his release from custody in order to deal with his addiction to drugs, and the prospect of him taking drugs again is perhaps the most important factor suggesting special circumstances in this case.11 I am satisfied that the offender is remorseful and that he, now that he has not taken drugs for some time, is a different person to the person he was in March/April 2007. A pre-sentence report makes reference to some mental health issues concerning the offender. They are at least partly related to his drug use. I have taken the offender’s mental health issues into account, both in reducing the sentence I would have otherwise have imposed upon him, but also to the extent of the accumulation. However, it is certainly not the case that the offender’s mental health issues allow a lenient sentence to be imposed. To the contrary, a significant sentence is necessary both to deter the offender from relapsing into drug use and then crimes, but also to reflect the significance to the community of offences such as these, which are frightening, dangerous and committed for what is often very small reward.12 Community concern, or at least judicial concern, about sentences imposed on armed robbers led to the second guideline judgment in New South Wales, that of R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. In that case the Court of Criminal Appeal postulated a reasonably common situation, or reasonably common case, which would ordinarily result in a sentence in the range of four to five years. Of course, that judgment is only a guideline, but it is one which I must bear firmly in mind. As was recognised by Mr Coroneos, there is a close relationship between the present case and the standard case postulated in the guideline judgment.13 Of course, the standard case in Henry involved a plea of guilty which was in later cases clarified to be a plea of guilty with limited utility. That is the case for two of the matters which the offender needs to be sentenced. Those pleas came in very late in the piece. On the other hand, the third offence for which the offender is to be sentenced involved an early plea with the offender being committed for sentence to this court. Accordingly, the sentence I would otherwise have imposed for that matter is twenty-five per cent less to reflect the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty. That of course does not mean that it is necessarily the lowest sentence that I will impose, because the timing of a plea of guilty is but one matter which affects the sentence to be imposed for any particular offence.14 It is a fundamental rule of sentencing that the sentences reflect the objective gravity of an offender’s conduct, so even where a person pleads guilty early it does not mean that the sentence is necessarily lower than other offences where a late plea of guilty was entered.15 The offender is currently serving his sentence on protection. It is no longer automatically assumed that those serving their sentences on protection will do their time in custody harder than the general prison population, nor can it be assumed that the offender will serve the remainder of his sentence on protection. I will take into account, however, that there are two risks. One is the risk that he will serve the entirety of his sentence on protection, and the second is the risk that this will involve him doing his time in custody harder than others in the general prison population. The fact that he is and may well be on protection in the future is another matter suggesting not only a reduction in sentence but also special circumstances in this case.16 Mr Coroneos suggested an appropriate overall sentence with a non-parole period to be imposed in this case. That suggestion was fairly close to what I ultimately propose to impose. There is a need, of course, to impose sentences which are partially cumulative on each other. Each matter involves a separate act of criminality. Each matter involves a new victim, subject to the frightening experience of having a knife presented to them, and it is certainly not the case that the offender should feel that he has been able to commit any of these offences “for free”, as it were. 17 On the other hand, of course, the principle of totality applies such that the overall sentence reflects the overall criminality. The sentences I impose are these.18 For the offence committed on 17 April 2007, taking into account the Form 1, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years, to date from 20 April 2007. I set a head sentence of four years.19 For the offence committed on 18 April 2007, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years, to date from 20 April 2008, and a head sentence of four years.20 For the offence committed on 9 March 2007, I sentence the offender to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two years to date from 20 April 2009, and I set a head sentence of five years. 21 Thus, the overall sentence is one of seven years with a four year non-parole period, and the offender is eligible to be released to parole on 19 April, 2011.

     DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS v DENNIS BASIC 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: Before the court is an application by the Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions dated 8 December 2008 for review of the decision of Grove J made on 27 November 2008 acceding to an application for bail by the respondent, Dennis Basic. 
     
      
    2 On 3 October 2008 the Director of Public Prosecutions charged Mr Basic with two relevant offences, namely, that between 25 February 2007 and 26 May 2007 at Sydney in the State of New South Wales and elsewhere he did conspire with Stephen Wayne Spaliviero (Spaliviero) and Michael Selim (Selim) to murder Maurice Melville (Melville). The second was that between the same dates Mr Basic did conspire with the two persons to whom I have referred to murder Darren Cameron (Cameron). Each of Melville and Mr Cameron were critical witnesses in support of a charge by the Director of Public Prosecutions against Spaliviero that he knowingly took part in the manufacture of an amount of a prohibited drug, namely, Ecstasy, which was not less than the large commercial quantity applicable to that drug. There were other charges against Spaliviero which are not presently relevant. 
     
      
    3 The Crown case against Mr Basic is contained relevantly in a document dated 3 October 2008 headed Crown Case Statement prepared by Mr Craig Everson of the Crown Prosecutor's Chambers in Sydney and which, so far as Mr Basic is concerned, contains relevant allegations against him in paragraphs 30, 32, 49 to 52, 54 and 55. 
     
      
    4 In a further document provided to the Court and headed “Outline of Facts” there is a repetition of the material contained in the paragraphs on the Crown Case Statement to which I have referred, and which also sets out the evidence, the nature of the identification of the witness and other documentary evidence in support of the allegations in question. 
     
      
    5 Essentially the Crown's case is that in late February 2007 Spaliviero, whilst in custody, asked his girlfriend, Charlotte Lindstrom (Lindstrom), to arrange a meeting with Mr Basic which occurred and at which Lindstrom handed to Mr Basic two sealed notes provided to her by Spaliviero, together with the sum of $40,000 in cash. It was alleged that Mr Basic told Lindstrom that he would do what Spaliviero wished him to do provided he received $100,000 and a pill press. On 13 March 2007, so it is alleged, at Spaliviero's request Lindstrom gave Mr Basic a further $60,000. 
     
      
    6 It would appear on the Crown case that it is alleged that the notes that were given by Lindstrom to Mr Basic contained a request or instructions from Spaliviero to Mr Basic to arrange the execution of the witnesses Melville and Cameron. However, whether that is so or not remains doubtful given that the notes are apparently no longer in existence and there is no-one apart from Spaliviero and Mr Basic who is able to give evidence as to their contents. Certainly Lindstrom cannot, as apparently her evidence was that she was unaware of their contents and did not open them before handing them to Mr Basic. 
     
      
    7 Lindstrom met with Mr Basic again on 21 May 2007 when she received from him a bag containing $70,000 in cash. It is asserted that on that occasion Lindstrom and Mr Basic proceeded to the former’s car, which was parked in the Angel Place Car Park in Sydney. Lindstrom then approached the car park attendant and asked if she could have some mail directed to him (Basic). She provided the attendant with Mr Basic’s address, so it is alleged, in order that he could send all the information he had gathered to that address to be given to her (Lindstrom). The information in question was, it is alleged, information obtained by Mr Basic either through himself or through a person with whom he was associated, Selim, containing details of the premises at which the witnesses Melville and Cameron could be found, including photographs of them. 
     
      
    8 As the primary judge indicated in his judgment, Mr Basic does not deny that he received the money from Lindstrom but says that it was given to him in order to assist in the preparation of Spaliviero's defence. His Honour considered that that was not a matter upon which he could make any determination, but he observed that it was an arguable proposition.  
     
      
    9 The overall picture his Honour formed on the material which was before him, and which is before us, was that there were triable issues and that he was unable to reach any useful conclusion in saying that the Crown case was either strong or weak. Speaking for myself, I would not necessarily agree with that conclusion. I would take the view that the Crown case is certainly stronger than 50%, but on the other hand one could not say that it was overwhelming. 
     
      
    10 It was common ground before his Honour, as it is before us, that Mr Basic was only entitled to bail if he could establish exceptional circumstances within the meaning of s 9D of the Bail Act 1978. 
     
      
    11 His Honour considered that there were such circumstances by virtue of the delay which had occurred from the time that Mr Basic was arrested and placed in custody at the end of May 2007 until his proposed trial which has now been set down for 1 June 2009. 
     
      
    12 His Honour noted that Mr Basic had been in custody at the time of the application before him for a period in the order of eighteen months, and that if bail was not granted he would remain in custody until the trial commenced in June 2009 and ended in October 2009 upon the basis of the Crown's estimate that it was likely to last sixteen weeks. 
     
      
    13 One of the reasons, as I understand it, for this delay is that in August this year it was only proposed that the conspiracy charges against the three accused would be heard; that is, the conspiracy to murder charges, and that the agreed estimate of the trial was that it would last one and a half to two weeks. Had an arraignment followed it could be anticipated that the trial would take place either late this year or early next year. However, in September of this year, some sixteen months after the arrest of Mr Basic, the Crown indicated for the first time by the despatch of the draft indictment that it was its intention to prefer five counts, including the counts to which I have referred against Spaliviero, and including two further counts against Spaliviero to the effect that he solicited a person known as AD to murder both Melville and Cameron. 
     
      
    14 Accordingly, this change of heart on the part of the Crown in relation to the contents of the indictment has the consequence that instead of the trial of Mr Basic taking place late this year or early next year, there would be a further delay of some six months before it commenced and some ten months before it concluded. His Honour therefore considered that that delay constituted exceptional circumstances. 
     
      
    15 His Honour was further of the view that the bail conditions that he proposed to impose were such that any risk of Mr Basic removing himself from the jurisdiction was unlikely. In particular, his Honour noted that one of the conditions was that the Mr Basic was to reside at his wife's home with his two very young children who he had hardly seen since each of them was born due to his incarceration, and that he had a very close family relationship not only with his own family but also with that of his wife. His father-in-law was a relatively well-known builder in Melbourne who had offered to employ Mr Basic during the period that he was on bail, employment that he sought in order to earn money for the purpose of funding his defence. 
     
      
    16 A further matter which was of concern to his Honour was that Mr Basic was presently incarcerated at Lithgow, his defence team was Melbourne based, and his wife who with the two children wished to visit him regularly were finding extreme difficulty in doing so having to travel not only from Melbourne to Sydney but also to Lithgow. That also increased the time that his lawyers were engaged in seeking instructions from him which added to the expense of his defence. 
     
      
    17 His Honour, therefore, granted bail subject to the following conditions: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. To be of good behaviour. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        2. To report to the OIC of Police Station at Frankston, Victoria daily between the hours of 7am-7pm unless in Sydney attending court. 
         
         
        3. Reside at 10 Fernshaw Place, Mt Eliza and be within those premises between the hours of 8pm and 6am and present himself at the door to police if they call to check his presence. 
         
         
        4. Not to associate or in any way communicate or attempt to communicate with directly or indirectly any Crown witnesses or co-accused. 
         
         
        5. Not to enter New South Wales unless to attend Court when required. 
         
         
        6. To surrender his passport to Det Sen Constable Hancock forthwith. 
         
         
        7. To stay away from all international points of departure from the Commonwealth of Australia. 
         
         
        8. To give an undertaking not to apply for any new passport or travel documents during the currency of bail. 
         
         
        9. To appear at the Supreme Court of NSW on 9/3/09 and thereafter from time to time as directed. 
         
         
        10. To enter into an agreement, without security, to forfeit the sum of $10,000 if he fails to comply with the bail undertaking. 
         
         
        11. That 3 person(s) enter into an agreement or agreements, and deposit acceptable security to forfeit the sum of $600,000.00 in total if the accused fails to comply with the bail undertaking. 
         
         
        Details of surety money for $600,000.00 
         
         
        11 (a)  
        That one further or two jointly person or persons enter an agreement with security to forfeit the sum of $100,000 if the apt fails to comply with his bail undertaking. 
         
         
          
          (b) That one acceptable person, other than the apt enter into an agreement and deposit acceptable security to forfeit the sum of $500,000 if the apt fails to comply with his bail undertaking. 
          ” 
          
         
        
       
      
    18 It is necessary at this point to mention matters that were not before the primary judge but are now before us. At the time that he was arrested at the end of May 2007, Mr Basic was on parole having been convicted on 30 August 2005 of the offence of armed robbery in respect of which he was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of four years with a non-parole period of 18 months.  
     
      
    19 On 16 August 2006 the Adult Parole Board of Victoria made an order that resulted in him being released on 21 August 2006. As I have said, he was, therefore, on parole at the time of the alleged offences in question. As a consequence of his arrest at the end of May 2007 and his extradition to New South Wales whereby he arrived in Sydney on 5 June 2007, the Victorian Parole Board on 13 June 2007 cancelled Mr Basic’s parole and issued a warrant for his arrest. As he was already incarcerated in New South Wales that warrant has, for obvious reasons, not been executed. 
     
      
    20 The ground upon which the parole was cancelled was that Mr Basic was in breach of one of his parole conditions, namely, that he was not to leave the State of Victoria without the written permission of the regional manager. It is apparent that he was in breach of that condition when he was in Sydney between February and May 2007 without advising and receiving the approval of the appropriate officer of the Adult Parole Board. 
     
      
    21 It is, therefore, apparent that if bail is confirmed, Mr Basic will return to Melbourne and, in accordance with the bail conditions set by Grove J and will be required to report to the officer in charge of the police station at Frankston immediately upon his return. There is little doubt that once he does so he will be arrested and the warrant to which I have referred will be executed and he will once more be placed in custody. 
     
      
    22 Two matters arise out of the foregoing. The first is that we have been informed by Mr Basic's counsel that under s 77 of the Corrections Act 1986 of Victoria where an Adult Parole Board has cancelled a prisoner's parole it may at any time by further order revoke that cancellation and on such an order having effect the parole order revives: sections 77(2) and (3). We were informed that in the event that Mr Basic's bail is confirmed today he will be released next Monday and returned to Melbourne immediately and on that day or the following day he will, as I have noted, once again be taken into custody.  
     
      
    23 However, we have also been informed that the Adult Parole Board may well convene within a matter of days in order to consider whether it should make an order under section 77(2) to revoke the cancellation order made by it on 13 June 2007. In that event Mr Basic would be released upon the conditions of the grant of bail imposed by Grove J. 
     
      
    24 The Crown, however, has pointed to a problem that may arise in the event that he is not so released pursuant to the revocation of the cancellation order. Apparently, if Mr Basic is placed back into custody in Victoria then his return for trial in New South Wales would need to be the subject of an application under the Prisoner’s Interstate Transfer Act. We were informed that applications under that Act require the approval of the Attorneys General of both the requesting State and the State in which the prisoner is held and that proceedings under this Act take a minimum of two months. Any such application would, therefore, need to be commenced expeditiously to ensure the attendance of Mr Basic at his next appearance in Sydney in March 2009. 
     
      
    25 I note that that appearance is for the purpose of an application which has been foreshadowed by him that his trial in relation to the two charges of conspiracy to murder be separated from the other charges in the draft indictment that relate solely to Spaliviero. 
     
      
    26 In my view, notwithstanding that I am of the opinion that the Crown case against Mr Basic is stronger than was considered to be the case by Grove J, nevertheless the circumstances of the present case are such as to justify the description of exceptional for the reasons that his Honour gave. If it be the case that it is necessary, in the event that the cancellation of his parole is not revoked, for an application to be made under the Prisoner’s Interstate Transfer Act then that is a matter for the authorities in this State. I do not consider that the bureaucratic delays that might be involved in the making of such an application should be a reason why bail should be refused in the present case. 
     
      
    27 It is a matter for the Crown authorities to ensure that any application under that Act is made with expedition and that it is treated by those who assess it with similar expedition so as to ensure that there is no further delay in relation to the trial of Mr Basic whether in conjunction with the charges against Spaliviero or not. There is no reason why he should be prejudiced by that type of delay.  
     
      
    28 As I have also indicated, the evidence establishes that Mr Basic has strong family ties in Melbourne and has significant reason to spend time with his family and to obtain funds by seeking employment with his father-in-law for the purposes of enabling his defence to be properly funded. True it is that if the cancellation of his parole is not revoked he will remain in custody but he will remain in custody in Melbourne and, therefore, his family as well as his legal representatives will be able to obtain much easier access to him than would be the case if he continued to be incarcerated in Lithgow or even in Sydney. 
     
      
    29 Accordingly, for the foregoing reasons, in my opinion the application for review should be refused and the grant of bail made by Grove J on 27 November 2008 should be confirmed subject to the conditions which his Honour ordered. I would only add to those conditions a further condition, namely, that compliance by Mr Basic with conditions 2, 3 and 9 shall be suspended for so long as Mr Basic is in custody in Victoria. 
     
      
    30 JAMES AJA: I agree with the judgment of his Honour the presiding judge. 
     
      
    31 PRICE AJA: I agree with Tobias J’s orders. 
     
      
    32 TOBIAS JA: The orders of the Court will be as I have proposed.

    SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: On 4 August 2008 the offender, Kevin Thomas RISBY, was arraigned upon an indictment alleging he committed 15 child sexual assault offences. He pleaded not guilty to each allegation. Pre-trial legal issues were determined on that day and a jury was empanelled the following day. On 14 August 2008 the jury returned with verdicts of guilty on all counts.2 There are two offences of inciting a female under the age of 16 to commit an act of indecency with him (s.76A Crimes Act 1900 – maximum penalty 2 years), seven offences of carnal knowledge of a step-daughter under the age of 17 (s.73 Crimes Act – 14 years), five offences of indecently assaulting a female under the age of 16 (s.76 Crimes Act – 6 years) and one offence of sexual intercourse without consent upon a person under the age of 16 (s.61D(1) Crimes Act – 10 years).FACTS3 The facts of the offences, of which I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, are as follows.4 The offences were committed between the beginning of 1980 and the end of 1982. The offender was the step-father of the two complainants KG and SK.5 KG was born in November 1967. SK was born in January 1970. They had an older brother, DR, who was adopted, and a younger brother, SR. Their mother, MW, was married to a man in 1964 but divorced him in 1973 when she found he was having an affair with her best friend. She met the offender later in 1973 and they were married in May 1974, whereupon he moved in to live with the family at their home in Lithgow. The children came to regard him as their father and they changed their names to adopt his surname. (It should be noted that they have long since ceased using his name). The marriage lasted until 1984 when MW found he was having an affair with a good friend of hers.6 The offender had employment at times during the course of his marriage to MW. There was some dispute about the extent of it but that is not important for present purposes. MW also worked. She had a job at the Lithgow Workers Club which required her to work various shifts which meant she was often not home until 9.00 or 10.00 pm. The family routine of an evening was that they had dinner at around 5.30 – 6.00pm; the children then bathed and changed into their nightwear; and they retired to bed at around 8.00pm. 7 The offender used to lie on the lounge watching television in the lounge room. There was a kangaroo skin rug on the lounge. It was apparently regarded as something of a treat for the complainants to lie on the lounge with him under the rug. 8 KG spoke of how for the first 6 to 12 months in this situation it was “cuddle time”. The offender, however, progressed to engaging in sexual activity. She said initially he would touch her over her clothes but it progressed to touching underneath her clothing. She would be wearing a nightie and underpants. She said he touched her on the chest but more towards the bottom half of her body including her vagina. She said he also got her to touch his penis, initially over his clothing but it progressed to him undoing his fly and exposing his penis and having her touch it. She spoke of him saying that this was their “special time together” and gave her to understand it was not to be discussed. She said she loved the attention at first, like any little girl would. However she also felt it was wrong but she could not say or do anything about it. She said that the offender would give her 50c to come and give him a cuddle on the lounge. 9 KG described the sexual touching on the lounge progressing to the point where the offender was digitally penetrating her vagina. When these things were happening on the lounge it was when she and the offender were alone, her mother was absent from the house, usually at work, and the other children had been sent to bed. It was a treat to be allowed to stay up and watch television with the offender in this situation.10 A matter that applied to both KG and SK in terms of understanding why they did not complain of the offender’s sexual activities with them was that he was a stern disciplinarian. He used corporal violence on all of the children. He disputed this at the trial and suggested that the girls were disciplined by their mother but I accept the evidence which was to the effect that he struck all of the children with either a leather strap or belt, or with a piece of dowelling rod.11 The first and second offences charged in the indictment concerned KG and they occurred during a family holiday at Sussex Inlet in late December 1979 to early January 1980. One day, KG got badly sunburnt and as a consequence had to stay indoors for the day while her mother and the other children went shopping. She was in their cabin reading a book and the offender came in, lay a towel across the bed and asked her to lay on it. He removed the bikini bottoms she was wearing and then performed oral sex upon her. She said he sucked her vagina for some 4 to 5 minutes and was using his fingers on her as well (Count 1 – Indecent assault upon a person under 16). She said he then obtained some Vaseline and rubbed it on the outside and inside of her vagina, got her to get on her hands and knees and inserted his penis into her vagina from behind. He ejaculated inside her (Count 2 – Carnal knowledge of step-daughter under 17). 12 The next specific incident occurred in the family home at Lithgow around the middle of 1980. KG said she was off school for a day, she was not sure why, and it was just herself and the offender at home. He told her to go into the main bedroom with him. He did not say why. He told her to undress and he helped her to do so. He then removed his own clothing. When he was naked she saw that he had an erection. He said that they were going to try something different today. He got her to perform oral sex upon him and he then did the same to her. He then rubbed Vaseline on the inside and outside of her vagina and had penile/vaginal intercourse with her. He persisted with this for about 5 to 10 minutes before he removed his penis and ejaculated on her stomach. He then said to her that this was their secret and she was not to tell anyone. KG said that she did not tell anyone about this because she was scared. She asked, rhetorically, “Who would believe me?”. (Count 3 – Carnal knowledge of step-daughter under 17). 13 Counts 4 and 5 were concerned with something that happened by the side of the Great Western Highway on an occasion when the offender and KG were returning to Lithgow after attending a physiotherapy session at the Blue Mountains Hospital at Katoomba in the latter part of 1980. The offender pulled over and stopped on the side of the road at Blackheath. He told her to take her underwear off. He removed a jar of Vaseline from the console and rubbed it on the inside and outside of her vagina. He also unzipped his pants and pulled his penis out. He used his fingers to penetrate her vagina (Count 4 – Indecent assault upon a person under 16). He then had her rub his penis up and down with her hand until he ejaculated (Count 5 – Incite female under 16 to commit an act of indecency). She said that the ejaculate went all over him, on his clothes, and a little on her hand as well and he used an old coat that was in the car to wipe up. KG said she was then told to put her underwear on and she was then driven back to school. 14 Counts 6, 7 and 8 were concerned with an incident that occurred after another trip to the physiotherapist in Katoomba. She had a later appointment that day so they returned to the home after it was over. No-one else was home. The offender told her to go and get undressed and come into the main bedroom. There he proceeded to take photographs of her with a Polaroid camera with her panties on and also with them off. He then got on the bed and told her to perform oral sex on him by sucking his penis. She did that for 4 to 5 minutes (Count 6 – Incite female under 16 to commit an act of indecency). The offender then had her lay back down on the bed and he performed oral sex on her by sucking her vagina. He also used his fingers (Count 7 – Indecent assault upon person under 16). The offender then proceeded to have penile/vaginal intercourse with her. She was on her back on the bed. He put a pillow under her pelvis and inserted his penis into her vagina. This went on for a few minutes, or 5 minutes. He then removed his penis and turned her around so she was on her hands and knees and he then inserted his penis from behind and had intercourse with her until he ejaculated inside her. (Count 8 – Carnal knowledge of a step-daughter under 17). 15 KG said that when this was happening she was scared, emotional and just did not want to be there. She said she was crying. She also said that the offender threatened her that she was not to tell anyone.16 The incidents to which Counts 9 and 10 relate happened in February or March 1982. MW was in hospital at the time. KG said that every night while her mother was in hospital some form of sexual activity would occur in the lounge room but that the main incident she recalled occurred in the bedroom. They had just come back from the hospital and the offender sent everyone to bed. After an hour he came and got her out of bed and took her into his bed. He took her nightie and underwear off. He then took photos of her in various poses with his Polaroid camera. She said he was naked and his penis was erect. He then performed oral sex on her and had her perform oral sex on him. He then got the Vaseline and rubbed it on the inside and outside of her vagina and penetrated it with his penis from behind with her on her hands and knees, she being on the bed and him standing beside it. (Count 9 – Carnal knowledge of a step-daughter under 17). After a few minutes he then told her to lay on her back and he proceeded to enter her vagina again with his penis in that position until he withdrew and ejaculated over her stomach (Count 10 – Carnal knowledge of a step-daughter under 17). KG was then told to put her clothes back on and go back to bed. 17 KG recalled that the next morning she got up early. She had made a decision to tell her mother. She walked up to the hospital but by the time she got there she had talked herself out of it because she was scared of what the offender would do to her. 18 Counts 11 and 12 are concerned with something that happened at a time when her brother, DR, had run away from home. This was sometime in 1982. DR was known to have some friends who lived at the Vale of Clwyd. KG was told by the offender to get in the car as they were going to go looking for DR. They drove to an area near there but the offender stopped the car in a sheltered area off a dirt track. 19 The offender told KG to get into the back seat and to take her clothes off. She was then made to perform oral sex on him, with her seated on the back seat and he standing just outside the car. She told him that she did not want to but he said, “You’re going to do it”. She did not believe she had a choice so she did. When his penis was in her mouth he had his hands on her head to control her. This went on for about 5 minutes or a little less. She said she tasted pre-ejaculate and it made her feel sick (Count 11 – sexual intercourse without consent with person under 16). 20 The offender withdrew his penis and told KG to get out of the car and lean over the boot. She was naked. She leant over the boot and he proceeded to have penile/vaginal intercourse with her from behind. This lasted for about 5 minutes. He then withdrew, told her to put her clothes back on and get back into the car. She did, but she got into the back seat. They then drove home. Whilst the purpose of this trip was to look for DR, there was in fact no attempt to do so.21 KG said that she did not tell anyone of being sexually abused by the offender until she told her husband in the early 1990’s. Soon after doing so she informed her mother. She said she did not go to the police at that time because she was too emotional and did not think she could cope going through the process. It was not until April 2006 that she felt able to cope with the process of coming forward to the police. 22 SK said she was sexually molested by the offender in the lounge room, on the lounge, always under the kangaroo skin rug. She said it started off with the offender just being friendly. They would be laying on the lounge, both on their sides, with him behind her. She said at the start it was just a friendly fun time. She was allowed to stay up late while all the other children were in bed. She was allowed to light his cigarette and also to open his beer and have a taste. Initially there was just cuddling but as time went on he started rubbing her chest outside her clothing and also touching her on the outside of her underpants. She said this happened many, many times. Then it became more sexual where he would feel under her nightie, on her skin and also down her underpants he would be feeling her and touching her vagina. It progressed to him rubbing her vagina and inserting his fingers. As they lay together with her back to him she said she could feel his erect penis pressing against her. She said she was terrified and always tense when this happened but she was not game to move or to say anything. She said he used to say things to her like, “Just relax, it’s okay, it won’t hurt, just lay still,” and other words to that effect. He also referred to these times under the rug on the lounge as their “special time” or something like “it’s our time together as father and daughter”. 23 SK said the progression from innocent cuddling to the touching having a sexual connotation was in 1978. The cuddling and the like had been going on for about a year at that stage. The frequency also increased from this point on. 24 She also mentioned kissing. She said on these occasions under the rug in the lounge room he would kiss her good night with an open mouth and with his tongue.25 Counts 13 to 15 were concerned with an incident that occurred in the lounge room of the family home on an occasion in late 1980. On this particular night MW was at work and the rest of the children had been sent to bed. SK said the offender made her stay up and she was lying with him on the lounge under the kangaroo skin rug. As opposed to other occasions when there was sexual activity with the offender, on this occasion SK said it seemed different in that the offender seemed rushed. There wasn’t the time of him being nice, by letting her change the channel on the TV, lighting his cigarette or the like and there wasn’t much fondling. She was wearing a nightie and underpants and he took the underpants off. He had pulled his own underpants down and he had an erection. He grabbed her hand and placed it on his penis and made her masturbate him (Count 14- indecent assault upon a person under 16). When the offender took his hand away she let go but he put it straight back on his penis, saying, “No, leave it there”. 26 When this was happening she was lying more on her back and the offender was on his side. He was using his other hand to touch and penetrate her vagina with his fingers going in and out (Count 13 – indecent assault upon a person under 16). This did not go on for very long, she said, because she was so tense. She said she was terrified and scared. She did not know what to do or to say. Then the offender proceeded to get up and climb over her. She thought he might be going to get off the lounge. However, he said, “Relax, this won’t hurt”, or words to that effect. He also said, “Keep your legs open”. She was lying on her back at this stage. She then described him being in a kind of kneeling position above her with one leg down on the floor and the other on the lounge. He told her to keep her legs apart and he attempted to penetrate her vagina with his penis. He couldn’t the first time and he tried again. She was saying, “Stop, it’s hurting, it’s hurting”. He replied, “It’ll be alright, just relax”. He then tried again and succeeded in penetrating her (Count 15 – carnal knowledge of a step-daughter under 17). She was yelling out, “Stop it, stop it, it hurts, stop it”. His penis was inside her for a short time, moving in and out, and then all of a sudden he stopped, withdrew from her and said in a frustrated tone, “Go to bed now”. She said her vagina was hurting and it was sore for at least all of the next day. 27 SK said that after that incident there were further occasions of sexual activity but the offender reverted to touching with his hands and digitally penetrating her. The frequency reduced because she tried to become more involved in activities away from the home with sport, mountain climbing, and spending time with friends so as to avoid situations in which she would be in the home alone with the offender. When she was home she started going to bed earlier, even if it was still daylight, to avoid being the one to be kept up. The sexual activity ceased when the offender and her mother separated.28 SK did not complain about the offender’s sexual molestation of her at the time. She said that normal family life resumed after he moved out. Over the years she told people that she had been abused as a child but did not go into detail. She thought she was strong enough to deal with it. She said she kept busy and pushed it to the back of her mind. There was some discussion about it with her mother and her sister in the early 1990’s but not in any detail as to what had occurred. She eventually made a statement to the police in July 2006. UNCHARGED ACTS29 At the trial the Crown relied upon uncharged sexual acts committed by the offender in support of its case as tendency and coincidence evidence. As those acts are not the subject of charges for which the offender has been found guilty he is not to be punished for them. The relevance of those other acts at this stage is simply to deny to the offender any leniency that might have been extended to him if the charged offences for which he was found guilty by the jury were isolated incidents. However, because there are 15 offences, none of them could really be regarded as isolated aberrations in the offender’s conduct.SUBJECTIVE FEATURES30 The offender was born in Portland in April 1944 and so he was aged 35 to 38 at the time of the offences and he is 64 now.31 He has a criminal history comprising two drink driving convictions in the early to mid 1970’s and a matter of possessing an unauthorised firearm in 2007. It is not a significant record in the context of the matters for which he today stands for sentence. 32 The offender gave evidence in the trial and again at the sentence hearing. He said he lived in Portland with his parents and left school when he was 16. He had a variety of employment in Portland and later in Lithgow and Sydney. He commenced working in coal mines at Camden and returned to Lithgow where he continued such work until he ceased full-time employment about 12 years ago.33 The offender has been married 3 times. The first marriage lasted 10 years and there are two children with whom he has no contact. The second was to the mother of the complainants and that too lasted 10 years. The third marriage was to Ms Roslyn Nolte, who gave evidence in the trial and on sentence. They separated in 1995 but maintain a friendly relationship. Ms Nolte has remained supportive of him throughout these proceedings. 34 The offender was placed on a disability support pension when he ceased work because of a collapsed disc in his spine. In 1999 he had a coronary aretery bypass graft. In 2007 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer.35 He has been on a variety of medications for these conditions. He told me that since being in custody he has remained on this medication although there are sometimes disruptions to him receiving it, such as when he was transferred from Bathurst to Silverwater for his court appearance on 7 October. He told me that in relation to the prostate cancer, his prostate was removed by surgery but he had been told that not all of the cancer was taken. To deal with this he has been receiving monthly Zoladex injections. After going into custody he was due for his next injection in September and I was told that he received it, albeit some days late. A letter from his urological surgeon, Dr David Sillar, indicates that he was planning on reviewing the offender in December this year. A letter from Justice Health dated 15 September 2008 in Exhibit 2 confirms that the offender has been provided with all of his medications and his monthly injections and that he is to be reviewed by a urologist in December 2008. 36 It was submitted by Mr Walsh that I should find that custody will be a greater burden for the offender than for most inmates because of his ill-health. He also submitted that I should find that being in custody would adversely affect the offender’s health and that I should take both of these matters into account in mitigation. There was some discussion about the basis upon which I could make such findings. In the end, the matter was stood over to 31 October 2008 and I asked for a report in relation to these matters from Justice Health. 37 The requested report was not to hand on 31 October and so the matter was further deferred, by consent, until today. This morning I have had tendered a report by Dr Stephen Hampton from Justice Health. It makes clear that Justice Health is aware of all of the problems that the offender has and it is able to provide appropriate management and treatment. It indicates that the conditions of his custody “may be affected only in that he may be transferred to Long Bay for treatment if required, as might any other inmate with medical conditions”. 38 It seems to me that the offender’s ill-health is a matter properly to be taken into account in a general sense but it is not a matter that will have any particular bearing on the circumstances of his custody and there is no evidence that being in custody will exacerbate any of his conditions. 39 The offender moved to Ballina about the time he ceased work. He lived there in a caravan park up until he went into custody.40 In relation to the offences, he said in his evidence that he does not accept the jury’s verdicts and maintains his innocence. 41 There was evidence in the prosecution case at the trial that was to the effect that the offender was a very lazy man who did not go to work for significant periods of time and who did virtually nothing around the house. The children were made to do many of the chores, including preparing meals, and their mother found it necessary to find work to make ends meet. There was also evidence that the offender was a very heavy handed displinarian who would physically beat the children for the slightest of indiscretions. This evidence was disputed in the defence case. I do not regard this evidence as being of any real significance on sentence. I can indicate that the complainants, and their mother, were most credible witnesses and I accept their version of these events. The only relevance this has is in providing an explanation for why the complainants felt inhibited in complaining about the offender’s sexual misconduct. The Crown contended that the offender’s behaviour in these ways was designed to keep the complainants quiet. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that even the offender’s violent and denigrating behaviour towards the complainants’ mother was in order to establish himself as the dominant force in the household, thereby rendering the complainants fearful of him and thereby compliant to sexual activity with him. I do not accept these contentions. In my view the offender’s behaviour in these ways was just because that was the type of person he was, at least at that time and in that environment. I do not think that the evidence is such that I could find that he deliberately behaved in those ways for the reasons the Crown has suggested. 42 Mr Walsh submitted that I should find that the offender is a person of good character. Aside from his behaviour during his marriage to the complainant’s mother I accept that. Whilst I will take this into account in his favour, good character is a matter of reduced significance in cases such as these.43 It was also submitted that I should find that he has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. I do not accept the submission about his rehabilitation prospects. He continues to deny the offences and, therefore, is obviously not contrite and has no insight into the causes of his offending behaviour. It is a matter of concern that there is nothing before me that would provide an explanation for the offending conduct. Often in cases such as these it is said that the offences were committed as a result of alcohol abuse or because of some psychological problem such as depression. I must take into account in considering this topic that there is no suggestion that in the 25 years or more since the offences that he has further offended. That would tend to suggest he has gained some control over impulses that he previously could not, or would not, control. It also, however, may simply be because he has not had the opportunity because he has not, in so far as I am aware, lived in the same household as young girls since that time. To the extent that rehabilitation includes acknowledging one’s wrongdoing and having insight into its causes I am unable to make a finding that the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation are any higher than “fair” . I accept, however, that he is unlikely to re-offend in this way and that is because of his age, his ill-health and the fact that he is unlikely to be permitted to have access to children in circumstances that would permit him an opportunity to sexually abuse them. 44 The offender gave evidence that up until now he has been in a form of protective custody which he referred to as “non-association”. I doubt that is the correct description of it. From what he said it is more likely to be limited association. I do not know what is likely to happen after the offender is sentenced. He will be classified and placed somewhere that is regarded as appropriate for that classification. It is well known that often offenders serving sentences for sex crimes, including child sexual assaults, are held together and away from other inmates in facilities that do not deny to them any access to programs or facilities. Without evidence that the conditions of the offender’s imprisonment will be more onerous I am unable to take this into account in mitigation of the sentences I impose.DELAY45 The period of time that has elapsed between the commission of the offences and now is relevant to my sentencing task in a number of ways. 46 It is relevant to the manner in which I assess the objective gravity of the offences of indecent assault and committing acts of indecency. In July 1981 the law relating to heterosexual sex offences was substantially amended. Prior to then, an act of penile/vaginal intercourse amounted to rape and all other forms of penetrative intercourse could only be prosecuted as an indecent assault. That means that the range of conduct that could amount to an indecent assault was wider, and included more serious conduct, than it did after the 1981 reforms. An act which might now be seen to fall in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, for example, would previously have been lower in the range. Alternatively, an act that might now be prosecuted as a more serious offence would previously have been something that tended to be in the upper echelons of seriousness as an offence of indecent assault, or an act of indecency.47 This consideration is relevant to Count 5 which involves an act of digital penetration, Count 6 of inciting an act of fellatio, Count 7 which involves an act of cunnilingus, and Count 13, an act of digital penetration. 48 The next way the delay is relevant is that if sentencing practices have changed in the intervening period in a way that is adverse to the offender I am required to replicate the sentencing practices of the time when the offences were committed: Regina v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 368.49 Identification of the sentencing practice that prevailed in 1980 to 1982 is not without difficulty. It has been the subject of discussion in a number of recent cases including Bradbury v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 93 and AJB v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 51, (2007) 169 A Crim R 32. 50 The regime of sentencing in that period of time was governed by the Parole of Prisoners Act 1966. Remissions of either 1/3 or 1/4 were applied to the head sentence but not the non-parole period. This necessitated setting non-parole periods that were short enough to allow a sufficient period for parole with the head sentence being substantially reduced by executive action. It was not until the Sentencing Act 1989 that there was any across the board statutory stipulation of the proportion of a sentence that was ordinarily to be represented by the non-parole period. No allowance was made for the remission system when sentences were imposed. It has recently been held that when a court now sentences for offences committed when the earlier regime applied, no regard should be had for the fact that sentences in those days were reduced by operation of the remissions system: see Bradbury v Regina at [24] and AJB v Regina at [31] – [33]. 51 In AJB it was noted that in 1982, non-parole periods were in the order of one-third to one-half of the total term of the sentence. I have reviewed a large number of NSW sentencing cases for a period from the early 1970’s to mid 1985 that are collected in Ross W Carter, “Australian Sentencing Digest”, (1985) The Law Book Company Limited, and in the 1985 Supplement to that work, and it confirms that this was usual for the period of 1980 to 1982 that I am concerned with in this case. Some cases involved non-parole periods greater than a half of the head sentence and, indeed, there are some where no no-parole period was fixed at all. What I make of this is that I should have regard to the usual one-third to one-half proportion but I should not feel constrained to impose non-parole periods in the present case of that proportion if there is good reason to do otherwise. 52 Having regard to the regime of sentencing that prevailed at the time of the offences has been accepted as a special circumstance under the present legislation justifying a departure from the now mandated usual expectation that non-parole periods will be three quarters of the total sentence. Other matters that Mr Walsh has submitted that I should consider in this context of “special circumstances” are that this is the first experience of custody for the offender and that he would benefit by a longer period of parole in order to re-establish himself in the community after what Mr Walsh conceded would be a “significant time in custody”. The parole period I am going to allow for in the sentences I impose will be more than sufficient to meet these needs. The accumulation of sentences, which it has been conceded I must order at least partially, is another matter that I will take into account. I must also, however, take into account what the majority in the High Court said in Power v The Queen (1973) 131 CLR 623 at 627 that the non-parole period should represent the “minimum period of imprisonment to be served because the sentencing judge considers that the crime committed calls for such detention”. In the same case, at 628, it was held that general deterrence is amongst the objectives in relation to setting the non-parole period. I record here that I have set the non-parole component of the total effective sentence I am going to impose with what was said in Power v The Queen firmly in mind.53 Another matter relevant to the principle that I must sentence in accordance with the sentencing regime that applied at the time of the offences is to determine whether any particular range of sentencing is identifiable. That poses a difficulty. There is, to my knowledge, no statistical material available to indicate what range of penalties were imposed for these kinds of offences in the early 1980’s. Absent that, and there being no other available means of identifying any sentencing range, for the correct approach I draw from the following in the judgment of Howie J in R v Moon (2000) 117 A Crim R 497 at 511 [70] – [71], case citations omitted, which was referred to and applied by Sully J in MJR: 
     
      
      [70] The nature of the criminal conduct proscribed by an offence and the maximum penalty applicable to the offence are crucially important factors in the synthesis which leads to the determination of the sentence to be imposed upon the particular offender for the particular crime committed. Even after taking into account the subjective features of the offender and all the other matters relevant to sentencing, such as individual and general deterrence, the sentence imposed should reflect the objective seriousness of the offence, and be proportional to the criminality involved in the offence committed. Whether the sentence to be imposed meets these criteria will be determined principally by a consideration of the nature of the criminal conduct as viewed against the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence. 
       
       
      [71] When sentencing an offender for offences committed many years earlier and where no sentencing range current at the time of offending can be established, the court will by approaching the sentencing task in this way effectively sentence the offender in accordance with the policy of the legislature current at the time of offending and consistently with the approach adopted by sentencing courts at that time. 
      
    OBJECTIVE SERIOUSNESS OF THE OFFENCES54 There are a number of features to be considered in assessing the objective seriousness of the offences. One is the nature of the activity that comprised the assaults. Where the offences involve penetration, some forms of penetration can be regarded as more serious than others: see Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447.55 Another matter is that to which I referred earlier concerning the change in the law relating to sexual assaults in 1981. 56 Another matter to take into account is that each of the offender’s crimes were committed in a gross breach of the trust that reposed in him as step-father to the complainants. However, some care is necessary in relation to this topic because a breach of trust is inherent in most offences of having carnal knowledge of a step-daughter. I propose to take it into account as an aggravating feature in relation to all of the other offences. 57 The harm that the offender occasioned to the complainants is another matter to take into account. Once again, however, some care is required in relation to this issue. It is a statutory aggravating feature to find that “the injury, emotional harm, loss or damage caused by the offence was substantial”: s.21A(2)(g) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. However, it is reasonable to assume that where an offence is specifically concerned with sexual assaults upon children the maximum penalty has been set by Parliament at least in part in recognition of the harm that such an offence occasions to such a victim. In saying this I should not be taken to mean that I do not accept that substantial harm was caused. Clearly it was as the victim impact statements that have been made by each complainant makes abundantly clear. What I am saying here is that it would be double counting for me to have regard to the maximum penalties for the offences which has inbuilt recognition of the harm such offences cause to children and then to also find the severity of the offences is aggravated because substantial harm was caused. This consideration applies to each of the offences in that they all include as an essential element, in effect, that the complainant was a child. 58 The age of the complainant is a relevant matter to take into account. The degree by which the age of the complainant is under the threshold age element of the offence can render an offence more serious. For example, the offences of having carnal knowledge of a step-daughter of or above the age of 10 and under the age of 17, can be seen as more serious where the complainant’s age was at the lower end of that range than if at the higher end of that range. The same applies to the indecent assault and acts of indecency offences where the age of the complainant is significantly less than 16. 59 Another matter to take into account is that the offences were not isolated incidents, or an aberration in the offender’s conduct. I am not saying that this is an aggravating feature because that would be to punish the offender for more than the individual offence itself. I am merely pointing out the absence of what would be a mitigating feature.60 Have regard to all of the circumstances of the offences, including the matters I have just mentioned, I am of the view that each of the carnal knowledge of a step-daughter offences and the sexual intercourse without consent offence is in the middle of the range of seriousness for offences of their type. They are not of precisely the same seriousness – for example, the offence in count 15 is a little more serious than that in count 12 because of the difference in the age of the complainants. Nevertheless, they are all within the mid-range. Apart from count 14, all of the other offences I assess as being above the middle of the range of seriousness for offences of their types. They are not, however, in the worst case category. The offence in count 14, given the wide range of conduct that could be found in an offence of indecent assault, must be categorised as below the middle of the range.OTHER SENTENCE CONSIDERATIONS61 General deterrence is a matter I must take into account in determining the sentences, including the non-parole periods. Personal deterrence is a factor but not of great significance because of my finding of the unlikelihood of further offending. Acknowledging the harm occasioned to the complainants, denouncing the offender’s conduct and making him accountable for his actions are further matters that must be taken into account. 62 The offender has been in custody since the date of the jury’s verdicts and so I will back-date the sentences until then.63 There must be a degree of accumulation of the sentences to recognise the multiple criminal acts and also that there are two victims. The extent of accumulation is limited, however, by consideration of the principle of totality.64 I will impose fixed terms of imprisonment where there is no utility in setting a non-parole period.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: I have before me today Leaton Richard Kingsly Sutcliffe. An issue has been raised as to his fitness to be tried in accordance with s 11 of the Mental Health Criminal Procedure Act. That issue has been tried by me alone. I note that this inquiry is not to be conducted in an adversarial manner and that neither the Crown nor Mr Sutcliffe has an onus of proof. The Crown tendered two documents without objection from Mr Steel, who appears for Mr Sutcliffe. The first was a report by Dr Westmore and the second a report by Dr Neilson. They are of like mind. They are both of the opinion that Mr Sutcliffe is unfit to be tried. Dr Westmore describes his conversations with Mr Sutcliffe. It is clear that Dr Westmore was unable to have a coherent conversation with Mr Sutcliffe. Dr Neilson agreed with the findings of Dr Westmore, noting that his severe communication disorder would render Mr Sutcliffe unable to provide reliable instructions or follow any proceedings in any adequate way. I will not repeat all of the conversations which Mr Westmore recorded from page 2 of his report but it is apparent that no meaningful communication was had between the doctor and Mr Sutcliffe. I will however refer to some aspects. For example when Dr Westmore asked Mr Sutcliffe whether what he did was wrong, he replied, 
     
      
       
      “Lord Carnarvon, Lord Carnarvon. He died of a mosquito bite, wonderful things, wonderful things.” 
      
    2 Very few of the responses recorded by Dr Westmore or Dr Neilson suggested that Mr Sutcliffe was capable of listening to a question asked of him and responding in a meaningful way. It is apparent, abundantly so, that Mr Sutcliffe’s bizarre answers which were unrelated to the questions asked of him would prevent him adequately instructing counsel appearing for him at trial. It is also clear that he would be unable to follow the proceedings in any meaningful way. The Presser tests requires before a person can be fit for trial a number of things, one of those is that the accused is able to give necessary instructions to his counsel by letting his counsel know what his version of the facts is and if necessary telling the court what it is. The accused also needs to be able to understand what is said against him so that he can make his defence or answer the charge. 3 I am satisfied without any shadow of a doubt that Mr Sutcliffe is unable to satisfy those two tests. He would be unable to participate in his trial in any meaningful way by understanding what was happening, instructing his counsel or responding to any of the evidence led against him. His inability to communicate is at the core of these problems. He would effectively not be present at the trial: physically he may be, but mentally he would not. In those circumstances I am satisfied that Mr Sutcliffe is unfit to be tried. I therefore make the following orders:4 I refer Mr Sutcliffe to the Mental Health Review Tribunal. I remand him in custody until the determination of the tribunal has been given effect to.

    2 KIRBY J: On 2 October 2007, Damien John Wright (the applicant) was arraigned before Solomon DCJ and a jury upon an indictment charging the following offences: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1:  
        That on 28 October 2006, he maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm with intent to do so upon Joel Fairfull, contrary to s 33 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         1900 (“the Act”) (maximum penalty: 25 years imprisonment with a standard non parole period of 7 years). 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: In the alternative - 
         
        That on 28 October 2006, he maliciously inflicted grievous bodily harm upon Joel Fairfull, contrary to s 35 of the Act (maximum penalty: 7 years imprisonment). 
        
       
      
    3 On 18 October 2007, the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on Count 1, but guilty on Count 2. 
     
      
    4 On 8 February 2008, Solomon DCJ sentenced the applicant to a total term of 6 years imprisonment (9.11.2006 to 8.11.2012), made up of a non parole period of 4 years (9.11.2006 to 8.11.2010), with an additional term of 2 years (9.11.2010 to 8.11.2012). The applicant seeks leave to appeal against that sentence. 
     
      
       
      Notice of appeal. 
       
      
    5 The notice of appeal relies upon a single ground expressed in these terms: 
     
      
       
       “1. The sentence is manifestly excessive.” 
       
       
      The incident. 
       
      
    6 Solomon DCJ, in his remarks on sentence, summarised the background to the incident in these words: (ROS 1/3) 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender met an acquaintance by the name of ‘Mark’ at about 7pm on 27 October 2006 at Central Railway Station. The offender and ‘Mark’, at about 8pm, attended a hotel in the Surry Hills area where they remained for about five and a half hours. During their time at the hotel both the offender and ‘Mark’ consumed a quantity of alcohol. 
        
       
       
        
        Joel Fairfull (‘the victim’) on 27 October 2007, at about 11.30pm met a number of friends, including a man by the name of Daniel Falzon at the Slip Inn Hotel in the city where he consumed a quantity of alcohol. At about 2am on 28 October the victim and Falzon met two sixteen year old girls, Veronica … and Chantelle … , outside the nightclub section of the Slip Inn Hotel. Veronica … gave the victim her telephone number. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 2am on 28 October 2006 the offender and ‘Mark’ left the Surry Hills hotel and attended upon the Criterion Hotel in Park Street, City. Between about 2.15am and 2.45am Veronica … and Chantelle … also attended upon the Criterion Hotel where they fortuitously met up with the offender and ‘Mark’. The offender had met Chantelle … on two previous occasions and Veronica … on one previous occasion. Whilst at the hotel the two girls, the offender and ‘Mark’ consumed alcohol and the two girls engaged in flirtatious behaviour with the offender. 
        
       
       
        
        At about 2.45am on 28 October the victim telephoned Veronica … and made arrangements to meet her at the Criterion Hotel. During the course of this conversation the victim heard a male voice on the phone say ‘Fuck off’. Veronica … later telephoned the victim and told him there was nothing to worry about. The victim and Falzon made their way to the Criterion Hotel. On their way to the hotel the victim said words to Falzon to the effect of ‘Get ready, something may happen, there may be a fight’.” 
        
       
      
    7 His Honour then described what happened once the victim and his friend arrived at the Criterion Hotel. He said this: (ROS 3) 
     
      
       
        
        “Between about 2.45am and 3am the victim and Falzon arrived at the Criterion Hotel where they met up with the offender, ‘Mark’ and the two girls. Eventually all six of them sat at a table. 
        
       
       
        
        Whilst seated at the table the victim handed Chantelle … a bundle of money. A short time later Falzon said to ‘Mark’, words to the effect of, ‘What the fuck are you staring at?’ ‘Mark’ thereupon stood up and punched Falzon. The offender then stood up with a glass in his hand and walked to a position near the victim, who at this stage was sitting in his chair. The offender struck the victim in the face with the glass. The victim and the offender then engaged in a fight.” 
        
       
      
    8 The consequences for the victim have been severe. He suffered injuries to his face, forehead and eyes. He underwent emergency surgery in respect of his eyes. There has been a substantial loss of sight. He is no longer able to drive. He is required to wear sunglasses, even on dull days. He finds difficulty with reading, which was his passion, and with his computer screen, which was his livelihood. He has been left with obvious scarring to his face. The psychological consequences have also been severe. He has lost confidence and has required counselling. 
     
      
    9 During the sentencing hearing, the applicant gave evidence. He said he believed that the victim paid Chantelle money in order that she prostitute herself. His Honour remarked that Mr Wright made no reference to that belief when he gave evidence at the trial. An affidavit was filed by a solicitor employed by Legal Aid which stated that he had received instructions from the applicant along similar lines. His Honour, however, was not persuaded. He said this: (ROS 4) 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not give much weight to the offender’s evidence regarding his belief that the victim handed money to Chantelle for the purpose of Chantelle prostituting herself. I come to this view for the reason that the CCTV film tendered in the trial clearly reveals that offender, at the hotel, had a romantic interest in the two girls prior to the victim and Falzon arriving at the hotel. I find that the offender’s action in attacking the victim was precipitated not by his concern for the welfare of Chantelle …, but for his concern that the victim and Falzon were rivals for the attention of the two girls.” 
        
       
      
    10 His Honour characterised the criminality involved in Mr Wright’s actions in these words: (ROS 4) 
     
      
       
        
        “I find that the offender’s attack on the victim, whilst unplanned, was deliberate, unprovoked and effected in a cowardly manner. I find the offence to be at the high end of the range of objective seriousness for the offence.” 
        
       
      
    11 Further, there were a number of aggravating features. First, the offence was committed whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty (s 21A(2)(j)). On 19 March 2006, he was charged with the offence of resist an officer in the execution of his duty. He was released to conditional bail on that day. The offence was committed whilst he was subject to that bail. 
     
      
    12 The second aggravating feature was that he was intoxicated at the time of the offence, knowing that he had a history of committing offences of violence whilst intoxicated. At the trial he said that he had consumed about eight drinks prior to the commission of the offence. He told W John Taylor, a psychologist, in a report which was tendered: (p5) “I was drunk and someone got hurt.” 
     
      
    13 Solomon DCJ set out part of the cross examination of the applicant during the sentencing hearing. It was in these terms: (ROS 5/6) 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Right, now you also told Mr Taylor that you had a problem with alcohol for some time, is that correct? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And that alcohol had been a factor in most of the offences that you’ve been convicted of? 
         
        A. I’d say all of the offences, yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. All of the offences? So it’s fair to say that you’ve got a problem with alcohol haven’t you? 
         
        A. Yes, that would be correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. That alcohol predisposes you to being violent, doesn’t it? 
         
        A. Under certain circumstances in the past, I have been violent when drunk, yes that’s correct. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And would it also be fair to say in light of the matter that you have already been convicted of, that you tend to have a predisposition to when you become intoxicated to arm yourself with a bottle or glass? 
         
        A. I couldn’t comment on my predisposition. There’s a lot of different circumstances that happen on lots of different times and places. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You don’t deny that in the past when you’ve become affected by alcohol you’ve armed yourself with a bottle and hit someone in the face with it? 
         
        A. No I don’t deny that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You don’t deny that? You don’t deny that on another occasion you were stopped by police just after arming yourself with a bottle and breaking it, and approaching someone? 
         
        A. Actually I was found not guilty of approaching anyone with a bottle in that case. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But you were found guilty of being in possession of a broken bottle? 
         
        A. I did have a bottle, I didn’t threaten anyone with it, no. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Now it’s also fair to say isn’t [it] that you’ve been aware for some time that you’ve got this problem with alcohol and violence haven’t you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you would have been aware of that in October 2006 when this offence occurred? 
         
        A. Yes.” 
        
       
       
      Continuing disregard for the law. 
       
      
    14 There was a third matter of aggravation (s 21A(2)(d)). It was one of some importance. Mr Wright had manifested a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. The Crown tendered his criminal record. His Honour, ignoring certain convictions, identified those which he regarded as significant in sentencing the applicant. They were: (ROS 6/7) 
     
      
       
        
        “1. On 23 April 2001 at the Bidura Children’s Court the offender was convicted of the offence of malicious wounding. The offender was placed on probation for 12 months. 
        
       
       
        
        2. On 6 December 2001 at the Hornsby Children’s Court the offender was convicted of the offence of Assault Police in the Execution of Duty. The offender was fined $600. 
        
       
       
        
        3. On 15 August 2003 at the Sydney District Court the offender was convicted of the offence of malicious wounding. The offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years with a non parole period of 18 months. 
        
       
       
        
        4. On 2 October 2003 at the Manly Local Court the offender was convicted of the offence of common assault. The offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 6 months. 
        
       
       
        
        5. On 20 October 2003 at the Downing Centre Local Court the offender was convicted of the offence of common assault. The offender was placed on a s 9 bond. 
        
       
       
        
        6. On 20 October 2003 at the Downing Centre Local Court the offender was convicted of having custody of an offensive implement in a public place. The offender was placed on a s 9 bond for a period of 9 months. 
        
       
       
        
        7. On 20 October 2003 at the Downing Centre Local Court the offender was convicted of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The offender was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 9 months.” 
        
       
      
    15 Three of these matters were of particular concern. Each involved the applicant arming himself with a glass. The Crown tendered an outline of the facts in respect of each offence. The first occurred on 4 July 2000 and was dealt with at the Bidura Children’s Court on 23 April 2001. It involved an altercation between a number of individuals at the McDonalds restaurant at Cremorne. During the course of the altercation, the applicant struck the victim in circumstances which were described as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The victim … turned his head to see if his friend was okay and when he turned his head back to face the young male, the Young Person who was holding a beer bottle in his right hand struck Bates with the bottle connecting with his left eye and nose.” 
        
       
      
    16 The victim was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital. His nose was broken and he had a four centimetre laceration above his left eyebrow. There was, in addition, a five centimetre laceration “from in between his eyes down to the inside corner of his left eye”. The lacerations required stitching. 
     
      
    17 The second offence occurred on 9 October 2001. It was dealt with in the Local Court on 20 October 2003. Mr Wright was charged with having an offensive implement in his possession in a public place. There had been a fight involving the applicant and others in a street in Crows Nest. The victim broke free from the grasp of the applicant and his male companion and ran to the Crows Nest Hotel. Thereafter the following occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “A short time later the Defendant was outside the Crows Nest Hotel, Falcon Street, Crows Nest. At the time he was in possession of a glass bottle holding it by the neck. The Defendant has smashed the end of the bottle against a garden bed. He has approached the Victim, Bordakiewicz, holding the jagged end of the bottle within 30cm of the victim’s stomach. 
        
       
       
        
        He has raised the bottle towards the victim’s face. The victim fearing that he may be stabbed moved back inside the hotel. The defendant was confronted by hotel security and left the area.” 
        
       
      
    18 The third matter of concern to the sentencing Judge was a charge of malicious wounding. It occurred on 26 April 2002 and was dealt with in the District Court on 15 August 2003. The victim, Matthew Young, and the applicant had been friends for a number of years. They had a falling out. On 26 April 2002, a number of young people, including Matthew Young, congregated at a service station in Neutral Bay. It came to Mr Wright’s notice that Matthew Young had made a disparaging remark about him. He was reported as having said that he hated the applicant and wanted to hang him. The person who made the report added that Matthew Young had later said that “he didn’t mean it and it was just ‘drunk’ talk”. 
     
      
    19 The applicant’s reaction was described in these words: 
     
      
       
        
        “Almost immediately thereafter the prisoner calmly reached behind his back and picked up a broken beer bottle. He walked over to the exit area of the Service Station where the victim was standing and, without warning, punched him with the first in which he was holding the beer bottle. This blow struck Mr Young on the left hand side of his head in the area of the neck and ear lobe with the jagged edge of the bottle causing deep wounds to both areas. A struggle then ensured during which the prisoner still had hold of the bottle which was near the victim’s face. He took hold of both of the prisoner’s wrists and was able to avoid any further injury.” 
        
       
      
    20 The victim was taken to Royal North Shore Hospital. His injuries were recorded as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … deep laceration, ten centimetres in length to the left neck area involving penetration of muscle but not the neurovascular structures below … also … a smaller laceration, five centimetres in length, in the triangle area of the neck and a deep laceration to the left ear which had nearly severed the left earlobe.” 
        
       
      
    21 Against that background, his Honour referred to the principle in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1987-1988) 164 CLR 465, which was in these terms: (at 477/8) 
     
      
       
        
        “ … The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind.” 
        
       
      
    22 His Honour concluded as follows: (ROS 10) 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender in committing the offence of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm on 28 October clearly demonstrated a continuing disregard for the law. The sentence to be imposed today will contain a strong element of individual deterrence in order that the offender be deterred from continuing to manifest a disobedience of the law and from committing further offences.” 
        
       
       
      Other aspects of the subjective case. 
       
      
    23 Mr Wright was examined before the sentencing hearing by Mr W John Taylor, psychologist. Mr Taylor recorded a history that the applicant’s parents had separated when he was ten years old. They had each later remarried. He was, according to Mr Taylor, “raised in a rather dysfunctional and abusive early family environment” (p 9). He began drinking alcohol at the age of 14 years and regularly became drunk. He later smoked cannabis and experimented with other drugs. He left school at the age of 16 years. To his credit, he returned to a TAFE college where he obtained the Higher School Certificate at the age of 19 years. He was reported to have been an above average student. In 2004 he obtained a Real Estate Certificate. 
     
      
    24 Mr Taylor administered a number of tests. He noted some antisocial personality traits, as well as “mild anger pathology” (p 7). He had twice been suspended from school for fighting. He was assessed by Mr Taylor as having a “moderate risk of recidivism” (p 8).  
     
      
    25 His Honour, however, did not accept Mr Taylor’s view on recidivism. He said this: (ROS 10) 
     
      
       
        
        “ … I find in light of the offender’s criminal record, which he has accumulated by the age of twenty-four and his abuse of alcohol, that I cannot accept that the offender has only a moderate risk of recidivism. I find the offender has a high risk of recidivism and that there is a need for society to be protected from the offender.” 
        
       
      
    26 It was said on behalf of the applicant that he was remorseful. Indeed, he wrote a letter to the sentencing Judge in which he said he was very sorry for the injuries suffered by the victim. He added that he “took responsibility for his actions”. He was “not trying to pass the blame”. His Honour, however, was again not persuaded. He said this: (ROS 10/11) 
     
      
       
        
        “I have concerns about the prisoner’s letter. My first concern is that the offender, in the letter, appears to place some degree of blame on the victim for the attack and this indicates the offender’s lack of true remorse. My second concern is that the offender does not appear to have developed any real insight into his alcohol/anger management problem.” 
        
       
      
    27 It should be noted that Mr Wright told Mr Taylor that he was innocent of the offence. He would only acknowledge that he should have handled the situation differently, by reporting the victim to the bouncers. 
     
      
    28 Three witnesses were called on behalf of Mr Wright. One was a family friend who had known the applicant since he was a child. He said that he had never seen him exhibit violent behaviour. Another was his eldest brother, who said that he had never observed his brother “to be antagonistic or aggressive in social situations”. Unsurprisingly, his Honour said this in respect of that evidence: (ROS 11) 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence of both Mr McDonald and Mr Benjamin Wright has little weight in light of the record of the offender.” 
        
       
      
    29 Mr Leith gave evidence as a former employer of Mr Wright. He was aware of his criminal record. He has known him for four years. He was a reliable employee and was regarded highly. Mr Leith said that he would be prepared to re-employ Mr Wright upon release. In his remarks on sentence, his Honour made the following comment concerning that evidence: (ROS 12) 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Leith’s evidence does not assist me to any degree in the sentencing process.” 
        
       
       
      The submissions of the parties. 
       
      
    30 In substance, the arguments advanced on behalf of the applicant can be summarised as follows. First, although his Honour characterised the applicant’s criminality as at “the high end of objective seriousness”, he did not find that it was within the worse category of case. Yet the head sentence imposed was almost the maximum, six years in the context of a maximum of seven years.  
     
      
    31 Secondly, his Honour placed too much significance upon the objective seriousness of the offence. It was serious, but there was also a subjective case, which his Honour all but ignored. The subjective case may not have been exceptional, but it was relevant. The applicant had the continuing support of his father and his partner. They continued to visit him in gaol. He had, since his incarceration, displayed a willingness to undertake programmes which will assist in his rehabilitation. Although he had a serious criminal record, there were periods where he had not offended. He had, during those periods, worked well. He was highly regarded by a former employer who was willing to re-employ him. 
     
      
    32 Thirdly, the statistics of the Judicial Commission suggested that the sentence imposed was in the top two percent in terms of head sentence, and the top several percent in terms of the non parole period. Finally, a comparison with other cases supported the view that the sentences were excessive. Reference was made to R v Steeden (NSW CCA, unreported, 19/8/1994); R v Woodhouse (NSW CCA, unreported 20/12/1996); R v McAdam (NSW CCA, unreported, 29/9/1997); R v Rowe (NSW CCA, unreported, 10/12/1997); R v Mackey [2006] NSWCCA 254; Morris v R [2007] NSWCCA 127. 
     
      
    33 The Crown responded by emphasising the serious nature of Mr Wright’s crime. The circumstances of aggravation had to be given weight, especially Mr Wright’s “continuing attitude of disobedience of the law” (Veen v The Queen (No 2) (supra)). The aggravating features meant that the statistics and other sentences were of limited assistance. Attention was drawn to the observation of Barr J in R v Trevenna [2004] NSWCCA 43; (2004) 149 A Crim R 505 at 530/531, where his Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        “[99] Another difficulty concerns the use by way of argument of the facts and resulting sentences in cases unrelated to the case under appeal. It is sometimes put that the facts of the case under appeal and those of the case cited for comparison are so alike that the sentences, too, should have been alike. Since they were not, error must have occurred. Hunt CJ at CL warned against such an approach in  
        R v Morgan 
         (1997) 70 A Crim R 368 when he said at 317 - 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It is quite wrong to compare the sentence under challenge directly with that imposed upon another offender (who is not a co-offender) simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. What must be looked at is whether the challenged sentence is within the  
          range 
           appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence (other than that of a co-offender) which merely forms part of that range. As Mason J said in  
          Lowe  
          (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 612; 12 A Crim R 408 at 411: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           ‘the reference to an appropriate sentence is apt to be misunderstood. Generally speaking, a sentence within a limited range of years is appropriate to the circumstances in which the offence was committed and to the character, antecedents and conditions of the offender. As the ascertainment and imposition of an appropriate sentence involve the exercise of judicial discretion based on an assessment of various factors it is not possible to say that a sentence of a particular duration is the only correct or appropriate penalty to the exclusion of any other penalty.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [100] When speaking of ranges of culpability and sentence counsel seem to have assumed that there must be a precise correlation between the two. While no doubt offences of high culpability ought to attract high sentences and those of low culpability low sentences there need be no precise correlation between sentences in unrelated cases where the facts are similar. Sentencing is an art. Sentencing judges have to evaluate a mass of evidence and different judges evaluate differently. Even if it were possible to say that the culpability in two unrelated cases was the same it would not be correct to say, if the sentences were different, that for that reason alone one of them must be wrong. To say so would deny the existence of judicial discretion. 
        
       
       
        
        [101] The statement of Hunt CJ at CL in  
        R v Morgan 
         is of general application …” 
        
       
       
      Conclusion. 
       
      
    34 I accept the Crown’s submissions. In my view the sentence was not manifestly excessive. There was no error. Whilst the offence may not have been in the worst category, it was certainly at the high end. His Honour did not impose the maximum. He did, nonetheless, include an element of personal deterrence and that was entirely appropriate, given Mr Wright’s continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. I have no doubt that his Honour was mindful of the applicant’s subjective case. It was, however, as counsel acknowledged, not an exceptional case. 
     
      
       
      Orders. 
       
      
    35 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. That leave to appeal should be granted. 
       
       
      2. The appeal be dismissed. 
       
      
    36 HALL J: I agree with Kirby J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Grove J and with the additional remarks of Howie J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Hosking DCJ in the Sydney District Court. In circumstances which are detailed in documentation to which I will refer the applicant pleaded guilty to a count of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm for which the prescribed maximum penalty is imprisonment for 7 years. His Honour sentenced the applicant to a total term of 5 years imprisonment in respect of which he specified a non-parole period of 3 years. He stated that, without the plea of guilty, the overall sentence should have been approximately 5 years 9 months imprisonment. The sentence hearing proceeded upon an agreed statement of facts bearing the signatures of the solicitors for the applicant and the prosecution, the police officer in charge of the investigation, the victim and the applicant. The content of this document was: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. At about 9.00pm on Thursday 29 June 2006, the offender attended the Peppermint Lounge at the Crest Hotel, Darlinghurst, with his then fiancée Victoria Berton to watch various live comedy acts. 
        
       
       
        
        2. Shortly after, the victim Clinton O’Grady and his friends arrived at the bar. At about 10.45pm, the victim’s brother Brendan arrived. 
        
       
       
        
        3. There were more than one hundred people at the bar sitting or standing watching the comedians. The offender and his fiancée were sitting at the back section of the seating area. The victim and his brother were standing behind where the offender and his fiancée were sitting. 
        
       
       
        
        4. The victim and his brother were talking to each other as they had not seen each other for some time. The offender was irritated and distracted by the conversation. The offender got up and approached the victim and stood within 30 centimetres of the victim’s face. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The offender said, ‘Shut the fuck up’. The victim replied, ‘Sorry for making a noise. I was just talking to my brother who I haven’t seen for a while.’ The offender then said to the victim ‘Get out.’ The victim said, ‘No, I’m having a drink. I’m going to finish my drink and then I’m going outside for a cigarette.’ At that time, the offender was holding a spirit glass in his right hand. The victim’s hands were down by his side. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The offender raised the glass and punched the glass into the victim’s face. The glass shattered in the victim’s face. The victim was forced backwards by the impact and fell to the ground. The victim’s face was bleeding. The offender also cut his own right hand when the glass shattered on the victim’s face. 
        
       
       
        
        7. Four (4) independent witnesses observed the offender approach the victim and punch the glass into his face. 
        
       
       
        
        8. The offender turned around left the premises immediately. When he got outside the bar, the offender ran northwards along Victoria Street. The victim’s brother chased the offender until he stopped on the corner of Victoria Street and Earle Place, Potts Point. Security staff from the Peppermint Lounge arrived and detained the offender until the police arrived. 
        
       
       
        
        9. The offender was arrested and ambulance officers treated his hand injuries. The offender was taken to Sydney Hospital by the police and his hand injuries were treated. He was taken to Kings Cross Police Station and entered into Custody. His rights under Part 9 of LEAPRA were explained to him. 
        
       
       
        
        10. The offender participated in a video recorded interview. He admitted approaching the victim and telling him to be quiet. He admitted punching the glass into the victim’s face. 
        
       
       
        
        11. The offender consumed three (3) Jack Daniels and Coke drinks on the night prior to assaulting the victim. 
        
       
       
        
        12. The victim was taken to St Vincent’s Hospital. He suffered the following injuries as a result of the assault: - 
        
       
      
    · .Two chipped upper front teeth.· Fractured nose.· Lacerations to his right eyebrow, nose, right cheek, upper lip, chin, inside mouth and hands. 
     
      
       
        
       
       
        
         The victim’s injuries were photographed soon after he arrived at the hospital and the following day. Copies of those photographs are annexed. 
        
       
       
        
        13. A shard of glass was stuck in the victim’s eye. His brother removed that from his eye before the ambulance arrived. A further shard of glass was stuck under the victim’s eyelid. That was removed by doctors in the emergency department. The victim was reviewed by an eye surgeon 10 days later. 
        
       
       
        
        14. The victim’s lacerations were sutured with 40 sutures under local anaesthetic by plastic surgeon Dr Ho. The victim underwent a closed reduction of the fractured nose, under general anaesthetic. He was discharged from hospital on 1 July 2006. 
        
       
       
        
        15. The victim subsequently attended dentist Dr Floyd and had his two chipped front teeth capped. He may require root canal therapy if the nerves in either of his two damaged teeth die in the future because of the trauma to the teeth caused by the impact of the glass. 
        
       
       
        
        16. The victim’s facial scars and injuries have been reviewed on two occasions and will be reviewed further in the future. He may require further surgery to correct persisting nasal displacement. He may also require further surgery to investigate possible nerve damage below his eye where a piece of glass was embedded. He suffers ongoing numbness in his upper lip. 
        
       
       
        
        17. On 30 June 2006, the offender was charged with malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (Section 33), maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm and malicious wounding (Section 35). 
        
       
       
        
        18. On 5 February 2007, the offender’s solicitor advised the ODPP that the offender was prepared to plead guilty to a Section 35 charge if the ODPP withdrew the charge of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm and did not elect to have the matter dealt with on indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        19. On 26 February 2007, that plea offer was rejected by the ODPP. 
        
       
       
        
        20. On 22 March 2007, the offender was committed for trial. 
        
       
       
        
        21. On 30 March 2007, the Crown filed an indictment charging one count of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (Section 33). 
        
       
       
        
        22. The matter was fixed for trial to commence on 28 May 2007. 
        
       
       
        
        23. On 7 May 2007, the offender’s solicitor renewed the offender’s offer to plead guilty to a Section 35 offence if the ODPP took no further proceedings on the charge of count of malicious wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm (Section 33). 
        
       
       
        
        24. On 23 May 2007, the ODPP advised the offender’s solicitor that the plea offer would be accepted. 
        
       
       
        
        25. On 28 May 2007, the offender was arraigned and pleaded guilty to a charge of maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm. 
        
       
       
        
        26. The offender was bail refused upon his arrest on 29 June 2006. He was released on bail on 6 July 2006. He has spent seven (7) days in custody in relation to this matter.” 
        
       
      
    3 The applicant has filed the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The learned sentencing Judge erred in his assessment of the value of the plea of guilty. 
        
       
       
        
        2. His Honour erred in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        3. His Honour erred in not finding a causal link between the mental illness of the applicant and the circumstances of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        4. His Honour erred in the weight to be given in the sentencing process to the applicant’s mental illness. 
        
       
       
        
        5. His Honour erred in his assessment of the applicant’s previous criminal record and the weight to be given to it in relation to the sentencing process. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
       
       
      GROUND 1 
      
     
     
      
       
        
        The learned sentencing Judge erred in his assessment of the value of the plea of guilty. 
        
       
      
    4 When the application was called on for hearing counsel informed the Court that this ground was no longer pressed. 
     
      
      GROUND 2 
       
       
        
        His Honour erred in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence. 
        
       
      
    5 It was appropriate for his Honour to establish the heinousness of the applicant’s conduct of which a significant element was the damage caused to the victim: Ibbs v The Queen (1987) 163 CLR 447. In this regard there is some detail in the agreed facts and his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “My assessment of the objective seriousness of this malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm is that as an example of this offence, this is an offence towards the top of the scale at least. In my view to ram a glass into the face of another ranks as one of the most vicious and cruel types of infliction of serious bodily harm. Evil though it would be to ram a glass into another’s arm or torso, it would at least mean that the victim could cover the wounds with clothing. Not so of course with the face. There is no hiding facial scarring. There was no provocation in this instance at all, unless the offender thinks that somebody carrying on a conversation behind him is provocation to in any way even explain what he did. If he does hold any such thought, (and I do not suggest that he does), then he would be completely wrong. The offender acted deliberately and entirely without the slightest provocation or justification.” 
        
       
      
    6 There are circumstances personal to an offender which may be relevant to the seriousness of an offence by reason of causal connection with its commission: R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. Complaint is made of an alleged absence of mitigation by reason of a relevant mental condition of the applicant and I will refer to this in more detail in connection with ground 3.  
     
      
    7 His Honour recited a lengthy extract from the Victim Impact Statement and, given the consequences to the victim recounted therein, it was entirely appropriate for his Honour in addressing his remarks on sentence to the applicant to remind him in vivid detail of the damage which his crime had caused. There is no basis for concluding that his Honour did other than receive and consider the content of the statement in accordance with s 28 of the sentencing legislation and I would reject the submission that his Honour “may well have inappropriately elevated the assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence by reference to it’s content”. 
     
      
    8 However, inter alia, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view it would be difficult, albeit not impossible, to inflict more damage to the face of another person by the use of a glass in this way than the offender did in this instance. To ram a glass into the face of another is calculated to inflict serious damage to that part of each of us is most conscious of in terms of the way other people perceive us, that is to say the face. I have no doubt whatever that this is what the offender intended. This was the essence of the malice in what he did to Mr O’Grady and to which he has pleaded guilty. An intention to disfigure Mr O’Grady’s face – an intent to seriously disfigure it. The offender accepts that what by his plea that what he did caused Mr O’Grady grievous bodily harm. In plain English, really serious bodily harm.” 
        
       
      
    9 In this context it is important to recapitulate the detail concerning the count upon which the applicant stands convicted. The distinction between count 1 (upon which the applicant was not convicted) and count 2 was an element in the former requiring proof that the applicant intended to inflict the grievous bodily harm suffered by the victim. In her written submission to this Court the Crown Prosecutor emphasized that “maliciously” which was an element of count 2 (as legislation then articulated) is defined to include “intent to injure” but to elevate an offence into the category that was charged as count 1 (which has a prescribed maximum penalty of imprisonment for 25 years) the intent must be specifically greater than simply to injure and be a specific intent to cause grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
    10 There is clear authority proscribing taking into account facts adverse to an offender which would so aggravate the offence charged as to make the offender liable to punishment for a more serious offence: The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. 
     
      
    11 There is, of course, no issue about the element of the offence to which the applicant pleaded guilty that his actions in fact caused grievous bodily harm. His Honour’s finding above quoted was that the applicant’s action was “calculated to inflict serious damage to … the face”, which expression is undeniably synonymous with an intent to cause really serious bodily harm. 
     
      
    12 Apart from the plain meaning of those words, his Honour repeated that he had “no doubt whatever that this (i.e. the infliction of serious damage to the face) is what the offender intended” and further “an intent to seriously disfigure” the victim’s face. 
     
      
    13 The inevitable conclusion is that his Honour proceeded to punish the applicant for harbouring the intent which he found. Such a specific intent was not an element of the offence for which the applicant was liable to be punished and in this regard I would uphold ground 2. 
     
      
    14 I add that, when this matter was canvassed at the hearing, the Crown Prosecutor acknowledged the defect and did not seek to press the issue beyond what had appeared in the written submission. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 3 
       
        
        His Honour erred in not finding a causal link between the mental illness of the applicant and the circumstances of the offence. 
        
       
      
    15 In written submissions counsel for the applicant noted that the Crown called no psychiatric evidence. In that a claimed psychiatric condition of the applicant might be relevant, it was a matter of mitigation in respect of which no onus lay on the Crown. There was evidence from a psychiatrist Dr Tran and the tender of a Justice Health file relating to the applicant. It is contended that his Honour rejected the evidence of Dr Tran when it was not open so to do.  
     
      
    16 A report by Dr Tran was tendered and he gave oral evidence. The latter was of some length. I observe that the first question in cross examination produced a concession that the opinions expressed in the report were based solely upon what the applicant had told Dr Tran and from hospital and gaol records of what the applicant had told other doctors. Histories were not confirmed by evidence from the applicant himself.  
     
      
    17 It was submitted that his Honour misconstrued the evidence of Dr Tran in that the doctor did not accept what the applicant told him was truthful or a reality, rather than being what the applicant told Dr Tran represented a perception. It was nevertheless necessary that perceptions expressed by the applicant and conveyed to Dr Tran by him be accurate in the sense that what he was describing was in truth what he perceived. His Honour had available the video recordings of the lengthy interview of the applicant by police which took place within hours of the commission of the offence, as well as the histories relied upon by Dr Tran. 
     
      
    18 His Honour’s function as a fact finder included determinations of the acceptability of expert opinions such as offered by Dr Tran and there was ample basis in the evidence, particularly in the lucidity of the applicant’s attempts to describe the facts to police in his own favour (and contrary to the facts which were the subject of the express agreement in the proceedings) for concluding that Dr Tran’s opinions were based upon unfounded premises and hence were unreliable. 
     
      
    19 The only evidence suggesting a link between the offence and any mental condition of the applicant was to be found in Dr Tran’s opinions. It was entirely open to his Honour to find that he was not satisfied that there was any link between any mental condition from which the applicant suffered and the unprovoked attack on the victim. 
     
      
    20 I add that neither was his Honour obliged to accept the descriptions of “weird” behaviour by the applicant which were said to have been observed by his wife. 
     
      
    21 Despite his finding of the absence of causal link, his Honour stated that he would make some allowance for the “possibility” and he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The plain and simple fact was that Mr O’Grady was annoying the offender and that he reacted to that with overwhelming anger and violence for which he is now criminally answerable. As I have said, I am not prepared to find the causal connection asserted between the offender’s mental conditions and what he did on this night. For whatever reason he is violent and he has little impulse control. Perhaps that is in someway connected with his mental condition, I will make some allowance in his sentence for that possibility.” 
        
       
      
    22 As, in my opinion, this Court should intervene to resentence there is no need to explore the extent to which this possibility may or may or not have been reflected in his Honour’s assessment.  
     
      
    23 As expressed I would reject ground 3. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 4 
       
       
        
        His Honour erred in the weight to be given in the sentencing process to the applicant’s mental illness. 
        
       
      
    24 Although there may not be a link between a mental illness harboured by an offender, if such a condition exists it may be that the offender is unsuitable as a vehicle to exhibit general deterrence and if that be the case, logically, the absence or the reduction of the significance of such an element would operate to reduce the assessment otherwise reached: R v Scognamiglio [1991] 56 A Crim R 81. 
     
      
    25 However, it does not inevitably follow that the existence of some mental illness must result in a lesser sentence: Courtney v R [2007] 172 A Crim R 371. The applicant submitted that his Honour erred in applying the principles of general and specific deterrence in the sentencing process and relied for that proposition upon what was said in R v George [2004] 149 A Crim R 38 particularly at pars 34-39 of that judgment. Nothing therein suggests, as the submission implied, that the existence of mental illness extinguishes the capacity of a judge in sentence assessment to give weight to both specific and general deterrence. The requirement is for a judge to consider in particular circumstances what weight should be given to personal deterrence: R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 and what weight should be given to general deterrence: R v Engert [1995] 84 A Crim R 67. 
     
      
    26 In the present case his Honour said in relation to general deterrence: 
     
      
       
        
        “I will say it once, that although the offender is said to suffer from a mental condition, my assessment is that the consideration of general deterrence should apply even to the offender in significant measure, even if not in full measure.” 
        
       
      
    27 On the question of personal deterrence his Honour made remarks which I have quoted when dealing with ground 3. 
     
      
    28 His Honour did not make his assessment contrary to any applicable principle and the extent to which the mitigation was included was a matter for the exercise of his discretion. Subject to what I will say in relation to ground 6, there is no demonstration that the discretion miscarried.  
     
      
       
      GROUND 5 
       
       
        
        His Honour erred in his assessment of the applicant’s previous criminal record and the weight to be given to it in relation to the sentencing process. 
        
       
      
    29 In written submissions ground 5 was articulated differently and in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        GROUND 5 – His Honour was not appropriately provided (and it is accepted that the Applicant’s representatives did not provide appropriate assistance in this regard) with a copy of the Court of Criminal Appeal’s decision of 2003. 
        
       
      
    30 Concerning the ground (in both of its expressions) it was contended that his Honour elevated a previous conviction of the applicant into an aggravating factor pursuant to s 21A (2)(d) of the Sentencing legislation, and that that was “not appropriate given the time gap between the offences and the nature of the mental illness”.  
     
      
    31 This submission conflated several concepts. The application of the statutory provision has had attention and the existence of prior record may indicate that retribution, deterrence or the protection of society warrant a greater severity of sentence: R v Shankley [2003] NSWCCA 253; R v Wickham [2004] NSWCCA 193. His Honour stated inter alia, in regard to the record, that the applicant was entitled to “no discount that a first offender might receive” thus explaining the manner in which the record was being taken into account. This was entirely appropriate: R v Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109. 
     
      
    32 It is true that there was a considerable time gap between the offences, the earlier conviction following events of 28 August 1992. 
     
      
    33 The applicant had pleaded guilty to an offence on that occasion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and he was sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for 18 months to be served by periodic detention. Subject to a requisite adjustment for time served, an appeal to this Court was dismissed on 6 December 1994. Thereafter, as can be gleaned from a judgment of this Court of 1 December 2003, ([2003] NSWCCA 384) the applicant presented himself on 14 December 1994 at the Periodic Detention Centre but he was denied entry because no warrant had been received there. Apparently it arrived subsequently and a number of notices were sent to the applicant at a particular address but these were returned unclaimed.  
     
      
    34 In 1995 the applicant (having not attended for periodic detention) returned to his country of origin, Turkey. A report from Blacktown Hospital recording an admission between 22 April 1996 and 17 May 1996 demonstrated that he had by then returned to Australia. However, a report issued in May 1999 revealed that he was in Turkey again. At some time he once more returned to Australia and on this occasion he was arrested by execution of warrant on 14 August 2002. Thereafter he was kept in full time custody until he was released on bail on 20 February 2003. The second appeal to this Court which I have mentioned was dealt with on 1 December 2003 and the consequence of its order was that the applicant was required (or in a practical sense, deemed) to be released on parole with effect from 20 February 2003.  
     
      
    35 I interpolate that his Honour commented that he considered that the applicant went to Turkey to avoid serving periodic detention but it has not been suggested that he took this into account as an aggravating factor when he was making sentence assessment. From the judgment of this Court in 1994 it can be seen that the facts of the 1992 offence were that the applicant approached a man who was said to have had an affair with his then wife at some time before the applicant had even met her. The victim thought that the applicant had punched him in the stomach but on detecting blood he realized that he had been stabbed and he thereupon drove himself to a hospital. The applicant followed him there and he was arrested whilst sitting in the casualty waiting room. 
     
      
    36 His Honour described this event as demonstrating that the applicant was a man capable of extreme violence without warning. He had reference to the judgment of this Court of 6 December 1994 and made express reference to the content of some of it.  
     
      
    37 Neither the Crown nor the applicant’s representatives drew attention to the judgment of 1 December 2003. There was no obligation on the Crown so to do. What has been said to be desirable is for the Crown to provide adequate information about prior convictions in order to enable a court to identify matters which might be similar or distinguishable: R v Mitchell unreported FCA 9 December 1997. This was done. 
     
      
    38 Expressed in either way I would reject ground 5. 
     
      
       
      GROUND 6 
       
       
        
        The sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
        
       
      
    39 As observed above, the maximum available penalty was imprisonment for 7 years. It is well established that a maximum may be appropriate for an offence in the worst category and/or for an offender who falls into the worst category. 
     
      
    40 So far as the latter is concerned, the applicant is aged 41 years and the matter in 1992 is his only prior offence. In the subjective sense he is well outside the category of being a worst offender. 
     
      
    41 It cannot be disputed that the offence itself was serious and his Honour was entitled to consider battery to the face with a glass to be misconduct of a high order, such consideration being confirmed by the extent of injury to the victim in this case. However, in the scale of things which could amount to grievous bodily harm it could not reasonably be concluded that the harm in this case lay at the top or near to the top of the range. 
     
      
    42 An assessment of 5 years 9 months imprisonment (prior to allowance for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty) approached so close to the maximum that in all the circumstances I would classify it as manifestly excessive. It might be considered likely that his Honour’s assessment came about as a result of the impermissible taking into account of an actual intention by the applicant to cause the serious harm suffered by the victim which I have discussed above concerning ground 2.  
     
      
    43 I would quash the sentence in the District Court and proceed to resentence. It is not necessary to repeat the facts or the matters dealt with in connection with the grounds of appeal. His Honour found there were special circumstances requiring departure in the applicant’s favour from the statutory formula in setting the non-parole period and I agree with his conclusion in that regard. In particular his Honour saw a need for lengthy supervision to require the applicant to adhere to a medication regime and it might be noted that he ordered conditions on parole appropriate to this. 
     
      
    44 I would assess an appropriate total sentence as 4 years 6 months which I would reduce by approximately 15 percent for the utilitarian value of the plea of guilty (congruent with the assessment by his Honour) resulting in a term of 3 years 9 months. Using the same proportion as Hosking DCJ I would calculate a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months.45 The orders which I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. The application for leave to appeal against sentence granted and appeal allowed. 
       
      2. Sentence in the District Court quashed. 
       
      3. In lieu thereof, the applicant sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months commencing on 23 August 2007 and expiring on 22 November 2009 with a balance term of 1 year 6 months commencing on 23 November 2009. . 
       
      4. The earliest date of eligibility of release to parole is specified as 22 November 2009. 
       
      
    46 HOWIE J: I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J for the reasons given by him. I simply wish to add that had it not been for the maximum penalty prescribed for the offence of malicious wounding, in no way would I have considered the sentence imposed manifestly excessive. In fact having regard to the nature of the injuries and the manner in which they were inflicted without any provocation or chance for the victim to take evasive or protective action, the penalty imposed was lenient as a reflection of the objective culpability of the applicant and the need to denounce and deter the conduct. 
     
      
    47 The offence, popularly known as “glassing”, is becoming so prevalent in licensed premises that there are moves on foot to stem the opportunity for the offence to be committed by earlier closing times and the use of plastic containers. The courts clearly must impose very severe penalties for such offenders, but of course within the limits afforded by the prescribed maximum penalty. In light of the fact that the maximum penalty for an offence under s 35(2), recklessly inflict grievous bodily harm, is now 10 years imprisonment, the increased maximum penalty should result in a marked increase in the penalty for offences of this nature. Had the sentence this Court is now substituting been imposed for the new offence under the Crimes Act with the increased maximum penalty, it would be arguably manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    48 I have some sympathy for the sentencing Judge because in almost all cases of this type of conduct there would be little difficulty in inferring the intention for the s 33 offence. The Judge’s statement as quoted by Grove J is absolutely correct in general terms but not having regard to the offence for which the applicant was being sentenced. The applicant was very fortunate, in my opinion, to be allowed to plead guilty to an offence under s 35. However the Crown having accepted that course, the Judge was bound to sentence the applicant accordingly.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: This is an appeal by Mr Johan Savic against his conviction on the charge of wounding one Daniel John Eschler (the “complainant”) with intent to murder him, contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 27. Mr Savic also seeks leave to appeal against his sentence for this crime and another committed some months before this offence. 
     
      
    2 The trial was conducted before a judge sitting alone (English DCJ) who, on 11 April 2005, found the offence proven beyond reasonable doubt. In the light of the trial judge’s conclusion on the more serious charge of wounding with intent to murder, her Honour did not need to come to any conclusion on the lesser and alternative count in the indictment: wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm, contrary to the Crimes Act, s 33. 
     
      
    3 The appellant had stood trial previously on the same indictment, in November 2004, before a judge and jury. The jury was unable to reach a verdict. 
     
      
    4 The trial proceeded before English DCJ from 5 April 2005, concluding on 11 April 2005. It was submitted by the appellant that he had consented to the course of trial by judge alone on the basis of advice that had been given to him by his then counsel. As part of the appeal, he said that counsel’s conduct in so advising him was incompetent. 
     
      
    5 By April 2005 when the trial took place, the appellant had pleaded guilty (on 8 November 2004) to a charge that on 11 September 2002 (about four months before the events that gave rise to the indictment for wounding with intent to murder) he did break and enter a dwelling house and therein maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm upon the complainant in circumstances of aggravation, namely knowing that there were persons present within the house. 
     
      
    6 After his conviction, English DCJ sentenced the appellant on 6 December 2005 in respect of both offences. In relation to the offence committed on 11 September 2002 to which the appellant pleaded guilty, he was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for five years commencing on 10 October 2003 and expiring on 9 October 2008. A non-parole period was not set as the offence was subsumed in the sentence imposed for the more serious crime. On the more serious offence of wounding with intent to murder, English DCJ sentenced the appellant to a minimum term of imprisonment of six years and six months commencing on 9 April 2007 and expiring on 8 October 2013. An additional term of three years and six months was set commencing on 9 October 2013 and expiring on 8 April 2017. The appellant was eligible for release to supervised parole on 8 October 2013. 
     
      
    7 It is important to understand the events of September 2002 which gave rise to the charge to which the appellant pleaded guilty and the place these events had in the Crown case in relation to the charge of wounding with intent to murder. The evidence of the circumstances of the offence in September 2002 was led to provide evidence of motive for the offence said to have been committed on 22 January 2003 and to demonstrate the relationship between the appellant and the complainant. 
     
      
    8 The complainant gave evidence that he was once friends with the appellant (whom he called “Johnny”). During 2001, they had lived together (with others) in Katoomba. After a falling out, the appellant moved out and the complainant did not see him again until 11 September 2002, by which time the complainant was living at Dalrymple Avenue, Wentworth Falls. On that morning, the complainant said that he was asleep in his room and heard banging on the windows and doors and heard a male voice screaming. He said that he did not recognise the voice immediately, but after he walked out of his room and went into the lounge/kitchen area at the front of the house he saw the appellant through the window holding a baseball bat and using it to try to open the back door. The complainant said that shortly after that he saw the appellant at the front door of the house screaming to be let in. He said the appellant hit the window next to the front door and used the baseball bat to break the window. The appellant entered the house and swung the bat at the complainant, who ran to the kitchen where the appellant hit him a number of times with the baseball bat, causing injuries including a broken elbow and broken bone in his right hand.  
     
      
    9 The complainant’s evidence was also that he and the appellant used to call each other names by way of friendly rivalry when playing soccer games. He called the appellant (who was of Serbian descent) “Serb scum” and the appellant called him (of Croation descent) a “Cro dog”. 
     
      
    10 The complainant also gave evidence that in 2001 he and the appellant used drugs together. He said that he (the complainant) had contracted hepatitis C in prison whilst getting a tattoo. 
     
      
    11 The transcript of the appellant’s former partner (Ms Locke) from the first trial was tendered. She said that at around 8.40 am on the day in question in September 2002, she was in the appellant’s car and they dropped their son off at day care. The appellant was angry and said “I’m gunna get this cunt”. She asked who he was talking about and he said she knew and that she was coming with him. He drove to Dalrymple Street, parking the car across the road from a house. She gave evidence that the appellant went to the boot of the car, grabbed the baseball bat walked to the house and started tapping on the windows with the bat saying in a loud voice “I know you’re in there, you dog cunt. Open up or I’ll smash my way through the window”. Ms Locke saw the appellant walk to the side of the house (where the front door was situated), smash a window and enter the house through the broken window. She heard a male voice yelling “Johnny, don’t”. Ms Locke heard yelling and screaming. The appellant subsequently came out of the house and returned to the car and drove off. 
     
      
    12 Evidence was also given in the form of transcripts from the first trial from two persons who were in the complainant’s house in September 2002 at the time of the above attack. These two persons and the complainant gave evidence that during the assault the appellant was yelling at the complainant “You gave me hep C you Cro dog”. 
     
      
    13 The complainant reported the matter to the police. It was the violent background, the reporting of the matter to the police and the evidence of the breakdown in the relationship between them that led the Crown at the trial of the more serious offence to lead this evidence. 
     
      
    14 Though not part of the Crown case at the trial, in cross-examination of the complainant, he gave evidence that on the night of 10 January 2003, a Mr Parker, whom he knew, was at the front of his house with others yelling and throwing rocks smashing two windows. On 13 January the complainant said that he was walking home and saw Mr Parker and Mr Sinclair (who once lived with him in Katoomba) and another male in front of his house. Parker had a bottle and Sinclair had a long knife. Parker smashed the bottle on a rock and walked towards him in a threatening way saying “come on dog”. The complainant understood that they were upset because he had caused the appellant to be charged for the offence in September 2002. The complainant ran off. He was chased by Parker who used the broken bottle to cut his (the complainant’s) hand and who jammed the broken bottle into his back. These injuries required him to go to hospital. In cross-examination, the complainant agreed that Mr Sinclair had referred to him as “Cro dog”. The complainant also said in evidence that the physiques and heights of Mr Parker and Mr Sinclair were nothing like the appellant. 
     
      
    15 The events of the night of 22 January 2003 were recounted by the complainant. He gave evidence that on that night he and a Mr Walden went to the cinema to watch a film. Upon coming back and arriving at the house, the complainant walked to the front verandah and started to unlock the front door. Both the complainant and Walden then gave evidence that while the complainant was unlocking the door a person came on to the verandah from their left. 
     
      
    16 At this point it should be noted that identification was the crucial issue in the trial. Two astronomical certificates were tendered certifying that on the night the moon was 85% visible, moon rise was at 2259 hours and there was maximum cloud coverage. 
     
      
    17 The complainant gave evidence that there was no light at the front of the house, but there were a few street lights along the road. The moon was out and it was dark, but not pitch black. Mr Walden said that the verandah was quite dark. He said that the street lighting did not provide much light and that the nearest light was on the opposite of the road approximately two houses up the street. 
     
      
    18 The complainant said that the person he saw on the verandah was at first 4 to 4.5 metres away from him. The complainant’s evidence was that he asked the person “Who’s that?” The person replied “Who is that?” At the time Mr Walden was standing between them. At the trial, the complainant said that he did not recognise the person at the time of first seeing him. The exchange between him and the person was repeated and the complainant saw a glimmer of light from the moonlight on a metal object which the person was holding in his hands at the side of his legs. The complainant said that he stepped towards the person and then “kind of realised who it was”. He gave evidence that he recognised the voice as being that of the appellant, although this did not appear in his police statement. The evidence of Walden and the complainant was slightly different as to the description of the person at this point. The complainant, however, gave evidence that he knew that the appellant “had it in for him” and he felt scared once he knew who it was, so he ran and he told Walden to run and said “it’s Johnny”. He ran off the verandah, past the appellant and felt a punch to his chest above his left nipple. He realised later that he had been stabbed. He continued to run down the driveway. He crossed the road. He ended up at the front yard of a neighbouring house and was tackled from behind by the appellant. They struggled and then the complainant ended up on his back. The appellant attacked him at close quarters above him with a knife, inflicting a number of stab wounds. The complainant said at the trial that he recognised who it was who was stabbing him, that he knew for fact who it was and that it was the appellant kneeling over him inflicting these stab wounds. The complainant’s evidence was that the appellant was saying to him “I’m goin’ kill ya, you dobbed me into the cops”.  
     
      
    19 The attack eventually stopped. The complainant said the he “played dead” and the appellant got up and walked away saying “don’t dob me into the cops”. 
     
      
    20 Walden did not give clear identification evidence. He had headed off in the opposite direction after the appellant chased the complainant. 
     
      
    21 Walden later took the complainant to the hospital where he was treated by Dr Haffner.  
     
      
    22 The complainant was visited at the hospital by a friend, Amy Prince, and by his mother. The complainant gave evidence that Prince asked him who it was and that he had told her it was Johnny. Ms Prince gave the same evidence.  
     
      
    23 The complainant’s injuries were a number of serious stab wounds to the upper quadrant of his abdomen, one in the area of the heart to the left of his chest, one in the area of his left shoulder blade, one to his right hand at the base of his little finger, a laceration in the area of his left ear and various superficial scalp lacerations. The complainant underwent emergency surgery for his abdominal wounds at the Katoomba Hospital. Following the operation, he was transferred to Liverpool Hospital because of a life threatening complication, being bleeding from the heart. There was medical evidence as to shock which was relevant as to the reliability of the identification.  
     
      
    24 The appellant gave evidence and was cross-examined. The evidence that he gave of the events of September was significantly different from that of the complainant and was in some respects contrary to the un-cross-examined statements of persons who gave evidence at the first trial. His history of the relationship between him and the complainant was different, emphasising the complainant’s familiarity and selling of drugs. The appellant denied the attack. 
     
      
    25 The trial judge accepted the evidence of the complainant as both honest and accurate and rejected the evidence of the appellant as totally unreliable.  
     
      
       
      Ground one: that the trial miscarried as a consequence of the Crown Prosecutor’s opening submission to her Honour; namely the admission into evidence by the Crown Prosecutor of inadmissible evidence that the appellant had pleaded guilty to another incident that would prejudice her Honour in determining the issue raised at trial 
       
      
    26 The evidence of the events of September 2002 were said to be inadmissible and “went to the very heart of the proceedings and caused the trial to miscarry”. The Crown Prosecutor opened as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Your Honour the two matters that are currently before the Court consist of the trial matter that your Honour had just heard particulars of, and a matter that preceded that, which is an aggravated breaking and entering of a house and an assault committed on the same person Mr Eschler. That matter resulted in a guilty plea, and for reasons that I’ll elaborate upon in a moment, some of the facts that attach to that case will form part of the evidence in this particular one. So at the end of the case, regardless of the verdict in the trial matter your Honour will be well placed to make a determination as to the facts that effectively surround, not just the trial matter but the earlier one as well. I turn to the trial matter. 
        
       
      
    27 This was not objected to by counsel. This was said to be an illustration of counsel’s incompetence.  
     
      
    28 I reject this submission. 
     
      
    29 The appellant disputed the substance of some of the evidence led by the Crown about September 2002. In that evidence, he denied the account of the circumstances out of which the offence arose that was the Crown case and gave evidence that it arose because the complainant refused to return to the appellant a gold chain which he had handed to the complainant as security for the payment of drugs bought from the complainant on credit. That, however, did not make the evidence inadmissible. 
     
      
    30 As the Crown submitted on the appeal, the evidence about the events of September 2002 was relevant. It was relevant to the Crown case against the appellant, since it was evidence of motive and of the relationship between the complainant and the appellant. It was not admitted as tendency evidence and the judge did not use it as such. In particular, since her Honour was required ultimately to sentence the appellant for the offence, it was not unreasonable for her to be told of the plea. The plea was the legal embodiment of the admission that he had committed the earlier attack. Her Honour directed herself as to the manner in which the evidence of the offence of September 2002 should be used and no complaint was made about that direction.  
     
      
    31 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground Two: that the learned trial judge erred in failing to accede to an application by trial counsel to have her Honour attend the location where it was alleged the appellant assaulted the complainant; namely the complainant’s evidence was clearly confusing as to his description of what he could or could not hear and see at the time of the assault 
       
      
    32 No error was made by the trial judge in her ruling on 5 April that she was not prepared to have a view. The trial judge expressed the view that if during the course of evidence she thought it might be of assistance she would raise the matter with trial counsel. She did not do so, presumably because she did not feel it necessary. The evidence of identification was as to voice and close visual identification. The assailant was directly upon the victim. 
     
      
    33 No further application was made by trial counsel to have a view. No error has been shown in the trial judge’s approach. 
     
      
    34 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground Three: the learned trial judge erred by disallowing trial counsel’s cross-examination of the complainant as to his participation in an act of injecting himself with heroin; namely, it was put to him that in the previous trial he had said something inconsistent which bore directly on his believability and his credit 
       
      
    35 Credibility and identification were central to the trial. The trial judge permitted a body of cross-examination about whether the complainant injected himself with drugs, whether the appellant injected him, and whether he knew how to inject himself and mix drugs preparatory to injecting himself. 
     
      
    36 After several objections as to relevance and assertions by trial counsel for the appellant that it went to the credibility of the witness, there was a detailed exchange in the absence of the witness. Trial counsel submitted that it was an aspect of his cross-examination to credit and identified inconsistency in the evidence that the complainant had given at the previous trial with the evidence he had given in chief at this trial. 
     
      
    37 After detailed submissions, the trial judge took the view that she could not see how who injected him (the complainant) before 1999 was relevant and disallowed the questions. All this cross-examination went to prior inconsistent statement and credit. Bearing in mind the terms of the Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), ss 102 and 103 and the course of a somewhat disjointed and rambling cross-examination (leaving aside the interruptions by way of objection), it has not been shown the cross-examination that had preceded the ruling by her Honour was of sufficient probative value to lead to the conclusion that there was any error in her Honour stopping the questioning. 
     
      
    38 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground Four: the trial miscarried as a consequence of trial counsel’s flagrant incompetence; namely that he did not object to the admission into evidence by the Crown Prosecutor of inadmissible evidence and counsel’s advice to the appellant to conduct the appellant’s trial on the basis of judge alone trial 
       
      
    39 The appeal proceeded on the basis that the advice given by counsel was that there should be, or that there could be, a judge alone trial. There was no waiver of privilege asserted about any other aspect of the communications with counsel. 
     
      
    40 There has been no incompetence shown. The evidence of what happened in September 2002 was not objectionable and it could have been led before a jury or a judge. Identification evidence was crucial, as was credibility. Given the apparent circumstances of the violence of the attack in September 2002 on the complainant’s version and the savagery of the attack in January, it might well have been thought to be a prudent course for the appellant’s counsel to prefer a judge alone trial in the light of the fact that the evidence was admissible and likely to be admitted. 
     
      
    41 There is no basis to conclude that the advice was other than competent.  
     
      
    42 There was no denial of procedural fairness. There was no lack of competence shown. 
     
      
    43 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground Five: the proviso has no application in this case as error has been demonstrated and there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice  
       
      
    44 I will come to this under ground seven, below. 
     
      
       
      Ground Six: for each of the above reasons alone and in combination there has been a miscarriage of justice 
       
      
    45 No error having been shown this ground of appeal does not arise. 
     
      
       
      Ground Seven: the verdict is unsafe and unsatisfactory and should be set aside 
       
      
    46 The Crown case depended upon the acceptance of the credibility and identification evidence of the complainant. The identification was of a man who, at night, in extremely close proximity to the complainant, spoke to and knelt over the body of the victim being stabbed. There was ample ground to think that the complainant could be positive about both the voice and the visual identification, albeit in the night darkness, given his personal familiarity with the appellant. 47 Given the advantage of the trial judge hearing and seeing the witnesses, there was a powerful case of the guilt of the appellant on the evidence that was accepted by the trial judge. There is no basis to conclude that the trial judge in any way misused her position in coming to her views about the credit of the appellant and the complainant. 
     
      
    48 Even if I am wrong as to any aspect of the complaints as to the conduct of the trial by the primary judge I do not see that any such error has caused any substantial miscarriage of justice on the evidence. Bearing in mind the trial judge’s advantages, it was a case that on the materials appeared to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    49 In oral address on appeal, the appellant made submissions additional to those in writing. He said that he did not use the phrase “Cro dog”. This was a matter dealt with in the evidence. The submission reflected, to a degree, a tendency for the appellant to identify “prejudicial” material (that is, material supporting the Crown’s case) with inadmissibility. 
     
      
    50 He submitted that there was a conflict between the evidence of Dr Haffner and of Ms Prince. Dr Haffner said that he did not allow anyone near the complainant at the hospital and Ms Prince said that the complainant said “It was Johnny” to her while waiting to be attended to at the hospital. 
     
      
    51 The trial judge accepted that Ms Prince had this conversation with the complainant. The evidence of Dr Haffner was not such as to require this to be rejected. 
     
      
    52 The appellant also stressed that the attackers of the complainant earlier in January 2003 threw his conviction in doubt. Again, the question of identification was central. Her Honour, after directing herself as to the requisite caution, accepted the complainant’s evidence of the close visual and voice identification. 
     
      
    53 The appellant also stressed the last words said by the attacker as he was walking away (“don’t dob me into the cops”) as indicative of a lack of intent to murder. The trial judge dealt with this, saying it could have been said in a sense of self-justification. It is not a factor which throws into any doubt the strength of the case on intent, given the extrinsic circumstances and the violence of the attack. 
     
      
    54 The appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      The application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    55 There were two grounds identified in relation to sentence: (a) an assertion that the sentences were excessive; and (b) a failure to take into account the utilitarian benefit of the manner in which the appellant conducted his trial. 
     
      
    56 Complaint was made also about the failure to set a non-parole period for the offence committed on 11 September 2002.57 The offences were ones of serious violence. In each episode, but in particular the second, the victim was subjected to a violent and brutal attack. The sentences in my view adequately reflected the objective seriousness of the offences. In my view, neither was excessive and taken together there was no excessive accumulation. 
     
      
    58 It was said that the trial judge failed to take into account and give credit for the co-operative manner in which the trial was conducted. Trial counsel made no such request to the judge. 
     
      
    59 There was no miscarriage of the discretion. 
     
      
    60 In the circumstances, it does not fall to this Court to resentence the appellant. If the question of resentencing had arisen there were matters of evidence which the appellant wished to address. He made submissions on the appeal which required a body of underpinning evidence to be legitimately made. The Court indicated that if it came to resentencing the appellant he would be given an opportunity to lead that further evidence. 
     
      
    61 Given my view that there is no error revealed in the sentencing judge’s approach, the issue of further evidence does not arise. 
     
      
    62 In my view of the orders of the Court should be: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
       
      3. Appeal against sentence dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    2 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Bennett DCJ at Parramatta District Court on 20 October 2006. The applicant and a co-accused William Le each pleaded guilty to an indictment containing four counts, jointly charging them with specially aggravated kidnapping and three counts of robbery in company. Those offences carry maximum available penalties of 25 years and 20 years imprisonment respectively. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was sentenced on the first count of kidnapping to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 10 November 2004 and expiring on 9 November 2010 with a balance term of 2 years, and on each of the counts of robbery to a non-parole period of 3 years with a balance term of 1 year to be served concurrently with each other and concurrently with the imposition on count 1. Pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act his Honour dealt with a further offence of driving whilst licence suspended in respect of which no penalty was imposed but an automatic disqualification came into effect. 
     
      
    4 Bennett DCJ sentenced Le to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months commencing on 2 October 2006 with a balance term also of 2 years and 6 months for the kidnapping and non-parole periods of 2 years with balance terms of 1 year on each of the robbery counts to be served concurrently with each other and the first 2 years of the non-parole period of the sentence on count 1. In circumstances which it will be necessary to detail, following an appeal to this Court Le was remitted to the District Court for resentence and on 17 April 2008 Blackmore DCJ imposed a sentence of imprisonment for the kidnapping consisting of a non-parole period of 13 months 14 days commencing on 4 March 2007 with a balance term of 46 months and 15 days and for the three offences of robbery to imprisonment for non-parole periods of 12 months also commencing on 4 March 2007 with balance terms of 2 years. 
     
      
    5 Le had been released to bail following the quashing of the sentences imposed in October 2006 and the resentence in April 2008 was structured to avoid his being returned to custody. The quashing of the sentences on Le by this Court was ordered on 23 November 2007 and Blackmore DCJ referred to Le “leaving custody in December 2007”. It appears therefore that the commencement date of 4 March 2007 was selected so as to create equivalent periods from that date to 17 April 2008 when his Honour ordered release to parole and the span of actual custody following the sentence by Bennett DCJ until release in December 2007. 
     
      
    6 A ground of appeal filed expressed a single ground that “the sentence imposed is manifestly excessive”. The thrust of submissions was to claim that the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by reason of the heavier sentence which he is serving compared to that ultimately received by Le: Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606; Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295.  
     
      
    7 Although they remain relevant, it is noted that the sentences on counts 2, 3 and 4 are now expired and the applicant is now serving only the sentence imposed in respect of the kidnapping. 
     
      
    8 At the hearing before Bennett DCJ the Crown tendered a lengthy statement of facts. Without reciting all of the detail, some central facts can be recounted. Le was acquainted with the victim Tuan Pham. He made a number of phone calls and other contacts eventually persuading Pham to enter a vehicle in which the applicant was a passenger. The vehicle was then driven away. 
     
      
    9 Le referred to his having been “robbed” of a mobile phone some three years previously as well as a later event and he asserted that Pham had something to do with them. It was threatened that Pham was going to be shot. The vehicle was stopped in what would appear to have been an isolated spot. Pham was dragged from the car by the applicant who punched him in the face. Other assaults followed and money was demanded. Pham telephoned a friend and in the early hours of the morning he was taken to the friend’s home where he obtained $150 which was later taken from him by the offenders. 
     
      
    10 On the next day the applicant called Pham and made a further demand and Pham complied with a direction to meet where, upon his arrival, the applicant and Le took a further $300 from him. The counts of robbery related to these two payments and a taking of Pham’s mobile phone which had occurred during the initial journey. 
     
      
    11 More phone calls were made to Pham and another meeting was arranged but by this time the matter had been reported to police. The applicant was arrested near the appointed meeting place and Le was arrested as he was returning to his home. 
     
      
    12 There were aspects of the alleged conduct of the individual offenders which were the subject of dispute. These can be noted but they do not require detailed elaboration at present. There was a significant contest between them concerning their respective involvement and his Honour heard evidence in those regards. In particular Le asserted that he participated in the crimes as a result of duress applied upon him by the applicant. Bennett DCJ found that he was not satisfied that threats by the applicant caused duress to Le “explaining his part in these offences”.  
     
      
    13 Evidence and argument concerning the roles of the offenders extended over a number of intermittent occasions. It became of significance that on one occasion the applicant gave evidence and was cross examined by the Crown Prosecutor in the absence of Le or his legal representative.  
     
      
    14 Ultimately Bennett DCJ expressed this finding: 
     
      
       
        
        “I find that together they embarked upon this venture without one or other being the dominant partner. Their motivation was the acquisition of funds to service their continuing addictions. As to the clear contrast between the extent of the conduct upon which they each engaged in the commission of these offences, and that it was Nguyen who did most throughout the actual detention of Pham, I find that this was conduct upon which he engaged for the joint purpose and that Le should bear equal responsibility for the violence in which he acquiesced and continued to exploit as further money was taken from the victim.” 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour reiterated this finding when dealing with subjective matters concerning Le. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have already indicated my finding in relation to the commission of these offences by these men that this was a joint enterprise for which this offender should bear equal responsibility, subject, of course, to the circumstances that are unique to him and which will impact upon the sentence that is appropriate for him.” 
        
       
      
    16 I turn to the course of proceedings against Le. As abovementioned, his appeal against sentence was heard and determined in this Court on 23 November 2007 ([2007] NSWCCA 330).  
     
      
    17 It was held that the reception of evidence from the applicant in the absence of Le or his legal representative constituted a denial of procedural fairness and for that reason the sentences imposed were quashed and the matter remitted to the District Court with this direction: 
     
      
       
        
        “As the sentencing judge accepted Nguyen’s evidence  
        the sentencing proceedings are to be commenced again 
         so far as the applicant is concerned before another judge of the District Court”. (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    18 Hence the hearing before Blackmore DCJ was a new proceeding. As Bennett DCJ’s remarks on sentence dealt with both offenders I infer that they must have been edited somewhat for those proceedings as Blackmore DCJ stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “One other factor no doubt taken into account by Judge Bennett was that of duress. I have not been given his Honour’s remarks on sentence with respect to this offender (Le), only those relevant to the co-offender (Nguyen), but it was conceded by the Crown in the sentencing proceedings that at least to some degree the offender (Le), could be seen to be operating under the duress of the co-offender (Nguyen). It was accepted that the offender (Le) had a real basis for fearing the co-offender (Nguyen).” 
        
       
      
    19 As already recounted, Bennett DCJ rejected the allegation of duress claimed by Le, however, in accordance with the direction of this Court, it was for Blackmore DCJ to make findings in new proceedings. Obviously the concession now recorded as having been made by the Crown concerning duress had not been made in the earlier proceedings against both offenders. 
     
      
    20 In addition Blackmore DCJ commented and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Certainly Judge Bennett who sentenced both of the offenders regarded the co-offender Nguyen as the principal offender. I agree with that assessment.” 
        
       
      
    21 The extracts from Bennett DCJ’s remarks where he found that the offenders should bear equal responsibility show that he did not find that the applicant was the “principal offender” but the statement by Blackmore DCJ should be understood as expressing his own assessment to that effect even though he was apparently mistaken about Bennett DCJ having the same opinion. 
     
      
    22 In Postiglione Dawson and Gaudron JJ (at p 301) observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated.” 
        
       
      
    23 Sometimes offenders are dealt with on different occasions and upon different evidence concerning their respective participations in crime. Postiglione and his co-offender Savvas were instances of this. Their Honours pointed out that it was the finding in the case of the appellant before them (Postiglione) upon which they had to act as distinct from findings in the separate proceedings concerning his co-offender Savvas. Thus, in the present case, they are the findings by Bennett DCJ upon which this Court must act. 
     
      
    24 Attention was directed to the observations of Hunt CJ at CL (in dissent on the result of the particular appeal) in Hodges v R [1997] 95 A Crim R 85. Inter alia, his Honour said at p 86: 
     
      
       
        
        “The factual bases of those different findings are often very different. Thus, if judge X sentences A upon the basis that, on the findings of fact made by that judge, A was merely a courier and B was the organiser of the drug importation, and judge Y sentences B upon the basis that, on the findings of fact made by that judge, the roles were in fact reversed, any sense of grievance on the part of A in relation to the different findings by judge Y would be disregarded should A seek to appeal against his own sentence. It would not be a justified sense of grievance. All things would not have been equal, although that is not to deny the proposition that the sentence imposed on A should bear a reasonable relationship with or relativity to that imposed upon B albeit sentenced upon a different factual basis.” 
        
       
      
    25 An addendum to that judgment referred to the publication of the decision in Postiglione an analysis of which did not cause any variation to the remarks just quoted.  
     
      
    26 The sentence received by the applicant reflected the objective seriousness of the offences in which, on the findings of Bennett DCJ, he and Le were of equal culpability. Subjective considerations were markedly different. The applicant pleaded guilty on the first day of his scheduled trial. He had a not inconsiderable prior record significantly including a sentence in July 2000 in Sydney District Court for robbery whilst armed with a dangerous weapon, for which he was sentenced to 4 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years to be served in a juvenile detention centre. Later for an offence of robbery he appeared in Sydney District Court on 19 August 2004 where he was sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year 13 days, which was structured to enable his release to parole from current custody forthwith. He was on that parole at the time of commission of the current offences. Bennett DCJ said that he had no information about the revocation of parole and he therefore commenced the sentences on 10 November 2004, the date of the applicant’s arrest, which virtually coincided with the commission of the offences. His Honour recognized that this may have operated to the practical advantage of the applicant in that it would be likely, if parole were revoked, that the commencement date of sentence might be postponed. 
     
      
    27 Bennett DCJ noted the applicant’s extensive history of drug use but commented “It in no way justifies the lifestyle that he has chosen committing crimes so that he may have funds to feed his habit.” He referred to the contents of a report by a psychologist Mr Borenstein, which recorded that the applicant had been the victim of stabbing whilst in gaol. Mr Borenstein thought that the applicant manifested some symptoms of post traumatic stress disorder. 
     
      
    28 His Honour formed a favourable opinion of the applicant’s credibility including his expressions of remorse and plans to attempt rehabilitation. As to the latter, given the history of earlier failed attempts recorded by Mr Borenstein, he thought that the prognosis needed to be guarded. He did not find that the applicant could be assessed as unlikely to re-offend and he considered that the prospects of rehabilitation were “not strong”.  
     
      
    29 In the whole of the circumstances, objective and subjective, I would not assess the sentences imposed as manifestly excessive and I am of that opinion that the impositions lay well within the range of the sound exercise of his Honour’s discretion. There is a tacit recognition of this in the placing of focus upon the alleged absence of parity between the applicant and Le in the submissions to this Court.  
     
      
    30 As already described, Le was sentenced on 17 April 2008 and it is the sentence then received which is claimed to provide an unacceptable contrast with the sentence received by the applicant. It was not contended that such a contrast existed in respect of the sentences, less than those received by the applicant, originally imposed by Bennett DCJ but subsequently quashed. 
     
      
    31 I have already made reference to the findings by Blackmore DCJ that the applicant “was the principal offender” and that Le had acted under duress from him. His Honour found that Le pleaded guilty at the first reasonable opportunity. Le had no relevant criminal history and was regarded as a person of prior good character and the offences were “an aberration” in his case. In reference to the finding of duress, Blackmore DCJ referred to evidence that Le took out a loan of $15,000 to help the applicant pay gambling debts. There was no realistic prospect of repayment but his evidence was that he was too terrified not to do as the applicant asked. 
     
      
    32 His Honour further found that there had been considerable delay in Le being dealt with (the offences having occurred in November 2004 and his final appearance for sentence being in April 2008) and that it was not caused by any action on the part of Le himself. 
     
      
    33 Significantly his Honour found that Le was now “substantially rehabilitated”. Le had addressed a gambling addiction which was an underlying cause of his offending. Whilst in custody he had taken the opportunities offered to complete many courses and since released on bail he had applied for some 20 to 30 jobs eventually succeeding in securing a job as a customer service officer and he had remained in this employment. 
     
      
    34 He had a stable girlfriend and had revealed to her on the very day his single lapse into gambling again. Le’s girlfriend expressed the opinion that he had matured during and after the period in custody. His Honour observed that return to custody would be likely to lead to the loss of employment. 
     
      
    35 Blackmore DCJ was expressly aware of the possibility that the longer sentence received by the applicant may lead to complaint but he observed that it was not for him to say whether the applicant might harbour a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    36 Looked at in isolation, whilst recognizing the powerful subjective case which had been made, it could nevertheless be postulated that the sentence received by Le in April this year was manifestly inadequate. Whether that were so or not, the intervention of this Court would not be attracted so as to impose the sentence upon the applicant which was disproportionate to his objective and subjective criminality.  
     
      
    37 A useful applicable summary was provided by Johnson J in R v Wei Pan [2005] NSWCCA 114: 
     
      
       
        
        “The elimination of unjustifiable discrepancy in sentencing is a matter of abiding importance to the administration of justice and to the community – the issue is whether the particular sense of grievance or injustice is a legitimate one:  
        Lowe v The Queen 
         (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 611 per Mason J. The test for determining the existence of a sense of grievance is objective not subjective. What has to be demonstrated by the person complaining on the grounds of parity is not that he feels aggrieved, but that a reasonable mind looking overall at what has happened would see that the offender’s grievance is justified:  
        R v Doggett 
         (Court of Criminal Appeal, 24 March 1996, unreported) per Sully J:  
        R v Ilbay 
         [2000] NSWCCA 251 at paragraph 6. 
        
       
       
        
        Where there is a degree of disparity so as to invite a reduction in the sentence imposed, it is not necessary for the Court of Criminal Appeal to intervene if the result of doing so is to produce a sentence disproportionate to the objective and subjective criminality involved:  
        R v Boney  
        [2001] NSWCCA 432 at paragraph 15. A stage can be reached at which the inadequacy of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is so great that the sense of grievance engendered can no longer be regarded as a legitimate one:  
        R v Diamond 
         (Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 February 1993, unreported, BC9302054);  
        R v Boney 
        , above, at paragraph 16.” 
        
       
      
    38 The favourable findings made by Bennett DCJ in relation to the applicant’s sincerity and credibility were reflected in a substantial element of leniency which is perceptible in the sentences which he imposed. In the circumstances discussed in the foregoing I would reject the contention of the applicant that the intervention of this Court should be attracted by reason of his harbouring a sense of grievance which is justifiable. 
     
      
    39 I propose that leave to appeal against sentence be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    40 HOWIE J: I agree with Grove J.

    1 HIS HONOUR: These are applications brought by Mr Button SC on behalf of Moustafa Cheikho, and by Messrs Waterstreet and Lange on behalf of Khaled Cheikho. The first is an application to exclude the identification of Moustafa Cheikho as being a person who was present at a camping trip between 12 and 14 April 2005 at Mulga Creek Station in far west New South Wales. The second application on behalf of Khaled Cheikho is in similar terms. It seeks to exclude evidence of Khaled Cheikho’s identification as being a person involved at the same camping trip.  
     
      
    2 The Crown proposes to call evidence in the trial from Matthew Cooley, an associate of Mr Fairey, the owner of the Mulga Creek property. The Crown also proposes to call evidence from Mr Fairey’s ex-partner Janine Bodkin. Their evidence will go, in part, to the identification of Moustafa Cheikho and Khaled Cheikho as being persons present at the camp. In particular, the evidence will include Mr Cooley's identification of the four of the accused as persons who were on the property at the relevant time. (There was no suggestion that the fifth accused Mr Jamal was there at the time). Secondly, there will be evidence of identification from Ms Bodkin of Moustafa Cheikho as the person with whom she spoke upon the arrival of a group of men at the property.  
     
      
    3 The identification procedures were arranged by the police separately with each of Mr Cooley and Ms Bodkin. They were carried out principally by Detective Toohey and videotaped by other officers on 16 April 2005. The procedure involved showing each of the two witnesses a series of photographs, some 30 in all, and asking them, in the case of Ms Bodkin, to identify the person with whom she had spoken, and in the case of Mr Cooley, asking him to identify people he had seen at the property at the relevant time.  
     
      
    4 Yesterday, when the question arose, it became apparent that the application had first been foreshadowed by Mr Waterstreet in correspondence with the Crown. This identified that it would be alleged that there had been a breach of s 3Zp of the Crimes Act by Detective Toohey, in that he had failed to undertake a separate identification process for each of the suspects who were under investigation, as required by that section.  
     
      
    5 When the matter was raised, Mr Waterstreet assured me that he anticipated there would be some discussion between the Crown and his side so that the issue could be shortened, or perhaps even resolved. Regrettably that has not happened, so it has been necessary to deal with this essentially pre-trial issue during the middle of the trial - perhaps ""the middle of the trial"" is too ambitious a phrase, but at least during the currency of the trial. This is a situation I would have preferred to avoid given that the Court has already devoted many months to the resolution of pre-trial issues. The practical consequence is that the jury have had to remain out of Court for a number of hours. This is precisely the situation I had hoped to avoid. 
     
      
    6 Yesterday, Mr Waterstreet indicated (transcript at page 1336) that his side would not be denying that Khaled Cheikho was present at the camp, but that the real thrust of the application would be a denial that Mr Khaled Cheikho was the person who was “principally doing the talking” at Mulga Creek, when conversations were had between the men and Mr Cooley. However, this morning Mr Lange, who presented the arguments, appeared to seek to move somewhat away from Mr Waterstreet's very fair concession, and put in issue the identification process itself and hence the identification evidence. This was on the basis that the identification evidence had been obtained illegally within the meaning of s 138 of the Evidence Act, and that it should therefore be excluded.  
     
      
    7 Mr Button of senior counsel supported the argument and put propositions on behalf of Moustafa Cheikho as to why the Court should conclude that there had been a breach of s 3ZP of the Crimes Act 1914. Both Mr Button and Mr Lange put various arguments to the Court as to why the Crown had failed to discharge the burden it bore under s 138 of the Evidence Act. This argument assumed that the Commonwealth Crimes Act had been breached. The Crown took issue with those submissions and put reasons why, in its submission, the Court should be persuaded that the evidence should not be excluded, but in fact should be admitted. 
     
      
    8 I will not go into the details of the evidence in any great particularity. Nor will I address each and every argument. I will however, refer briefly to some of the evidence. There is a statement that, by consent, the Court has been able to take into account. This is the statement of Janine Bodkin. Ms Bodkin says that on Tuesday, 12 April about 1pm she was alerted to the presence of a car outside the property. Ms Bodkin, in her statement, says she had a conversation with the driver of the car who told her that “they were the hunters”, although he said the actual hunters hadn't arrived yet. There was discussion about filling out forms, about providing a map of the property and the conditions of use of the property. Ms Bodkin guided the men to an area about three to four kilometres from the house.  
     
      
    9 In her statement, she described the driver and gave evidence about his payment of approximately $500 in cash. She said that on 16 April 2005 Detectives Toohey and Passak attended the residence, and that Detective Toohey showed her a photo presentation of about 30 photos of males. She had a look at all the photos and picked out one of them, number 9, as the man that had paid her the $500. It is clear that the man in this particular photograph was Moustafa Cheikho. 
     
      
    10 Matthew Cooley had been staying up at Mulga Creek Station for about a week before 12 April 2005. He learnt that some hunters were going to be on the property from 12 April 2005. On that particular morning he was not at the property, as he had to go to a funeral in Bourke. Later that day, Mr Cooley and the owner of the property went down to talk to the men who, by now, had arrived at the property. In his statement, Mr Cooley described the men in a very general way, and he observed one of the men in particular speaking to the owner. After that he and the owner went back to the house.  
     
      
    11 The next day he saw the men again up near the house, and he had a conversation with one of the males about motor vehicle problems. The next day the police came out to the property and the owner and Mr Cooley spoke to the police. One of the police officers asked whether Mr Cooley might be able to recognise any of the males from a group of photos, and there then took place an identification procedure involving an array of 30 photographs. 
     
      
    12 Mr Cooley picked out five photographs, being numbers 4, 9, 11, 20 and 25. He identified these as people he had seen at the property in connection with the trip. These photographs were respectively of Mr Elomar, Mr Moustafa Cheikho, Mr Khaled Cheikho, an alleged co-conspirator Mr Touma, and Mr Hasan. (I might observe at this point that counsel for Mr Elomar and Mr Hasan have indicated that they do not put in issue the identification of their clients for the purposes of the present application). 
     
      
    13 The Court was shown the presentation of the procedures involved in the two identifications on a DVD, which became Exhibit “A” on the voir dire. It is clear that Miss Bodkin very quickly and definitively identified the photo of Moustafa Cheikho. She said, ""It was him, definitely"". Mr Cooley, although not as forceful in his identification, quite carefully picked out the photos I have indicated. He was quite confident that these five males were persons who were at the property. There was one other photograph, number 3. He was not certain about that person, and indeed the police officer who gave evidence about the matter in Court, and who conducted the identification, Senior Constable Toohey, was unable to identify the person in photograph 3.  
     
      
    14 The first issue that arises on this application is whether there has been, in the case of each identification, a breach of s 3ZP of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). That section is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        3ZP Identification procedures where there is more than one suspect 
        
       
       
        
        If: 
        
       
       
        
        (a)  
        a constable is attempting to ascertain: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) which of 2 or more suspects committed an offence; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) the identities of 2 or more suspects who may have been jointly involved in an offence; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (b) for that purpose, the constable intends to conduct an identification parade or to identify a person by showing a photograph or a picture of a suspect to a person; 
        
       
       
        
        the constable must undertake a separate identification process for each of the suspects.” 
        
       
      
    15 To make some sense of s 3ZP it is necessary, I think, to look at a number of other sections of the Crimes Act 1914. In particular I think it is necessary to look at ss 3ZM, 3ZN, 3ZO, 3ZP and 3ZQ. The Crown has argued that, when regard is had, in particular to Senior Constable Toohey's evidence, that it could not be said that he, as the constable conducting the identification processes, was attempting to ascertain the identities of two or more suspects who may have been jointly involved in an offence. Those of course are, in part the words of the section.  
     
      
    16 It is fair, I think, to say that Senior Constable Toohey has suggested, at least when he was giving his evidence here, that he saw a distinction between the fact that, on the one hand, these men were generally being investigated with a view to seeing whether they had committed an offence under the Criminal Code, namely an offence involving some aspect of terrorism or politically motivated violence, and, the situation, on the other hand, where the procedures at Mulga Creek were more in the nature of intelligence gathering. Senior Constable Toohey appeared to believe that the events at Mulga Creek did not in themselves involve an offence.  
     
      
    17 It is not unimportant, so far as Senior Constable Toohey is concerned, to state that he said, which I accept, that he simply did not know of the provisions of s 3ZP of the Crimes Act 1914. He said, however, that in effect while the men may have been guilty of an offence, the Mulga Creek presence was to his mind, more of an intelligence gathering operation. Their presence there was not, as I have said, an offence in itself.  
     
      
    18 The position was made more complicated by the evidence of another New South Wales police officer, Ms Bibiana Passak who was also present at the property. She was clearly at the scene in a subordinate role doing the work involved in videotaping et cetera, and she was, as I say, clearly junior to Senior Constable Toohey. She conceded, however, that her state of mind was that she did regard Moustafa Cheikho as a suspect for the commission of a Commonwealth offence. That was plainly her state of mind.  
     
      
    19 To complicate matters even further there was, as well, a federal agent there. It is to be presumed that Federal Agent Paul Deller knew of the provisions of s 3ZP of the Crimes Act 1914 and he certainly said in his evidence that he was so aware, although I rather gathered the impression that he may not have necessarily passed a test if he were to be put to the proof of stipulating the precise requirements of the section. Be that as it may, Federal Agent Deller conceded that he was aware of the provisions of the section. He accepted that there were 30 photos shown. He identified photos which were shown to him in the witness box as being the ones that were shown to Mr Cooley and to Ms Bodkin. He conceded that he did not tell Senior Constable Toohey that this array did not comply with the Federal legislation.  
     
      
    20 However, he indicated that this was because he, in effect, took a step backwards in the procedure. He deferred to Senior Constable Toohey who was conducting the processes. For reasons he did not make not entirely clear, Federal Agent Deller seemed to think that, because Senior Constable Toohey, a New South Wales Policeman, was conducting the procedures, the identification procedures relevant to the New South Wales police force would, or should, prevail. His role, I stress, was a limited one, principally to operate the video of the procedures and to keep his superiors informed of the situation. He, like Senior Constable Toohey, had been involved in obtaining a warrant or warrants for intercepts or listening device product, and he properly conceded that, at least in connection with any such application, he would have had to identify an offence or offences for the purposes of making the application.  
     
      
    21 In re-examination Federal Agent Deller confirmed that his specific role, however, was that of videotaping the procedures.  
     
      
    22 The position as to the applicability of the section is, as I said during argument, far from clear. The Crown has asked me to find that the matters of the greatest consequence are the views of Senior Constable Toohey. If they be accepted, according to the Crown's submission, it could not be said that the section had any application. Because I have had to give a decision in this matter quickly, I have not formed a definite and final conclusion on this important preliminary issue. I am prepared to accept, for the purpose of the argument, however, that the section has been breached. I am less certain about this being so in the case of the identification procedure involving Ms Bodkin, because it seems to me that she had simply been asked to identify one person, and indeed what she was precisely asked to do was to identify one person to whom she had spoken. She was not called upon to identify more than one “suspect”, even if the person she spoke to could be described in that way. 
     
      
    23 Even if the broader view be taken, that this was part of an investigation to see whether an offence had been committed, and an endeavour to identify who may have committed the offence, then it must be said that the section is less likely to apply to her identification process because she was not involved in identifying multiple suspects. She was only involved, as I say, in identifying the one person.  
     
      
    24 In relation to the Cooley identification process, however, it seems to me that there is a respectable argument, particularly if one were to give the section a broad meaning and a useful meaning, that would require the Court to take an objective view about what was occurring, rather than simply to attempt to focus upon the subjective intentions of one of the constables present at the procedure, even if that constable were the officer in charge. The problem of course is further compounded when there were two other persons present, each of whom falls within the definition of a constable, and where each seemed to have taken a different view, or at least arguably a different view, than did the principal constable about the purpose of their joint endeavours.  
     
      
    25 But putting those last mentioned complications to one side, it seems to me there is, as I have said, a respectable argument to suggest that in relation to the facts of the present matter, s 3ZP was triggered. The better view is that objectively what was happening was that there was an attempt to ascertain the identity of two or more suspects who may have been jointly involved in an offence. That being so, the conclusion I would reach, on this admittedly preliminary view, is that here, certainly in the case of the Cooley identification, there was a failure to undertake a separate identification process for each of the suspects.  
     
      
    26 It is not necessary, I think, to emphasise the fact that Senior Constable Toohey appeared to be applying an approach that was entirely consistent with New South Wales practice and procedure for identification process by way of an array of photos. If the matter had fallen to be determined by the applicability of New South Wales procedures, then the present exclusion application would have little, if any, chance of success.  
     
      
    27 As a consequence, making the assumptions I have made, I conclude that there has been a breach of the section, certainly in the case of the Cooley process, and possibly in the case of Ms Bodkin, although less certainly so.  
     
      
    28 That being the position, it is necessary for the Court to consider the applicability of s 138 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        SECTION 138 
          
         
         
         
        Discretion to exclude improperly or illegally obtained evidence  
         
         
         
        (1) Evidence that was obtained:  
         
         
         
          
          (a) improperly or in contravention of an Australian law; or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) in consequence of an impropriety or of a contravention of an Australian law;  
           
          
         
        is not to be admitted unless the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting evidence that has been obtained in the way in which the evidence was obtained. 
         
         
         
        (3) Without limiting the matters that the court may take into account under subsection (1), it is to take into account:  
         
         
         
          
          (a) the probative value of the evidence; and  
           
           
          (b) the importance of the evidence in the proceeding; and  
           
           
          (c) the nature of the relevant offence, cause of action or defence and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding; and  
           
           
          (d) the gravity of the impropriety or contravention; and  
           
           
          (e) whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless; and  
           
           
          (f) whether the impropriety or contravention was contrary to or inconsistent with a right of a person recognised by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights; and  
           
           
          (g) whether any other proceeding (whether or not in a court) has been or is likely to be taken in relation to the impropriety or contravention; and  
           
           
          (h) the difficulty (if any) of obtaining the evidence without impropriety or contravention of an Australian law.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    29 The Court of Criminal Appeal has itself considered the operation of s 138 of the Evidence Act in recent times. In R v Camilleri [2007] 68 NSWLR 720 (McClellan CJ at CL, Bell and Howie JJ) reinforced the views expressed by Howie J in R v EM [2003] NSWCCA 374, to the effect that s 138 is concerned with balancing public interests. McClellan CJ at CL (with whom the other members of the Court agreed) said at 727 (31): - 
     
      
       
        
        “The fundamental concern of the section is to ensure that, if the law has been breached, or some other impropriety has been involved in obtaining evidence, this is balanced against the public interest in successfully prosecuting alleged offenders. The competing interests are obedience to the law in the gathering of evidence and enforcement of the law in respect of offenders. In R v EM (at 74), Howie J said: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The discretion under s 138 is similar to that which was described in R v Swaffield (1998) 192 CLR 159 as the public policy discretion at common law. Of course, there is a significant difference between the discretion under s 138 and that at common law: the section requires that the Crown persuade the Court to admit evidence that was improperly or unlawfully obtained. But just as at common law, the public policy discretion was distinct and separate from the unfairness discretion, so the discretion to admit evidence under s 138 is a distinct and separate discretion from that arising under s 90. The two discretions may overlap but they are not synonymous. Section 138 is not, in its terms at least, concerned with the Court ensuring a fair trial for the accused. Certainly that is not a paramount consideration when exercising the discretion. The discretion exercised under s 138(1) seeks to balance two competing public interests, neither of which directly involves securing a fair trial for the accused.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    30 Considering the matters stipulated in s 138(3), McClellan CJ at CL said at (35): 
     
      
       
        
        “This case is to be distinguished from a situation where evidence is obtained by police in knowing breach of the law or, where they may be reckless as to whether or not it has been lawfully obtained. Where the breach of the law is innocent, and the alleged offence serious there must be powerful countervailing considerations before the evidence should be rejected. The fact that the evidence is of high probative value will weigh in favour of its admission.” 
        
       
      
    31 There are several earlier first instance judgments in the Common Law Division of the Supreme Court that I have also found helpful. The first is that of Adams J in Director Public Prosecutions v Coe [2003] NSWSC 1 May 2003. In that decision, Adams J examined the common law principles, which had preceded the introduction of the section. He also examined the discussion by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its Interim Report on Evidence (No 26) of the issues sought to be addressed by s 138. Although his Honour was principally concerned with the meaning to be given to the word “obtained” in s 138(1), he also gave consideration to the general principles, which underpinned the public policy discretion, reflected both at common law and in the section of the Evidence Act. Adams J referred to a passage in Robinett v Police (2000) 78 SASR 85; 116 A Crim R 492 where Bleby J had cited Lobban (2000) 112 A Crim R 357 per Martin J (with whom Doyle CJ and he agreed). The passage is at 367 where Martin J said: - 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion however the history of the public policy discretion has been centred upon the discretion being enlivened only when the evidence is obtained by unlawful, improper or unfair conduct on the part of law enforcement authorities. In identifying the rationale for the existence of the discretion, the High Court and other authorities have emphasised the importance of preventing the courts from being ‘demeaned’ by the use of the ‘fruits of the illegality’ or being used ‘to effectuate the illegal stratagems of law enforcement agents or persons acting on their behalf’. The focus is thus upon bringing the administration of criminal justice into disrepute through the use of the courts in this manner. The courts have not undertaken the role of supervising the conduct of law enforcement authorities generally in circumstances divorced from any attempt by those authorities to use the courts to further the aims of their unlawful, improper or unfair conduct”. 
        
       
      
    32 Adams J thought this statement of the position was “plainly correct”. His Honour added however: - 
     
      
       
        
        “But I would not interpret this passage as doing anything more than restating the principle that the courts will not allow themselves to be manipulated into condoning crimes or serious improprieties by law enforcement officers or their agents, as is made clear by the concluding sentence.” 
        
       
      
    33 A second decision which I have found particularly helpful is that of Howie J in an interlocutory judgment Regina v Richard Bruce Cornwell Supreme Court, Common Law Division (unreported 20 February 2003). In that case his Honour was considering an application by the accused in that trial to hold that the evidence obtained as a result of the use of a listening device was inadmissible under s 138 of the Evidence Act. The basis of the ruling sought was that the evidence had been obtained in consequence of an impropriety by the investigating officers. The alleged impropriety was said to have been a misstatement in the affidavit in support of the warrant. 
     
      
    34 Howie J held that the evidence had not been obtained as a result of an impropriety and that the particular misstatement, seen in the context of the affidavit as a whole, led him to the view that all that was involved was an inadvertent mistake in an otherwise carefully drawn affidavit. His Honour held that such conduct could not alone be reasonably be regarded as improper, notwithstanding the significance of swearing an affidavit in support of a Listening Device Warrant. His Honour also found that there was no causal connection between the impropriety alleged and the obtaining of the impugned evidence. At para 20, his Honour said: - 
     
      
       
        
        ”I am of the view that, otherwise than when sub-sections 138(2) or s 139 apply, the court should determine whether the section in engaged having regard to the particular facts and circumstances before it but with due regard to the seriousness of a finding that evidence was obtained improperly or as a consequence of an impropriety and the outcome of such a finding. Not every defect, inadequacy, or failing in an investigation should result in a finding that the section applies merely because it may be considered that, as a result of those defects inadequacies or failings, the investigation was not properly conducted or that the police did not act properly in a particular respect. On the other hand the terms of sub-section 138(3)(e), which sub-section requires the court to take into account whether the impropriety or contravention was deliberate or reckless make it clear that the conduct need not necessarily be wilful or committed in bad faith or as an abuse of power”. 
        
       
      
    35 To these two authorities I would also add the reference to the decisions by Johnson J, R v Petroulias [No 8] 2007 NSWSC 82 and R v Petroulias [No 9] 2007 NSWSC 84. They are to like effect. (Although these decisions were involved, as was Cornwell with improprieties, they have a value by analogy in relation to the present issue which is concerned more precisely with an illegality or the actual breach of a statutory provision.) 
     
      
    36 Both Mr Button SC and Mr Lange have addressed the Court on the extent of the probative value of the evidence. Counsel, on behalf of their respective clients, differed somewhat on this point. But the difference is not a major one and I think the matter can be addressed broadly. In my view the probative value is quite high in each case. So too is the importance of the evidence to the Crown case. In the case of Khaled Cheikho, for example, the thrust of the defence case is that he is to be assessed, in terms of the Crown case at least, differently from the other accused, in the sense that he had not been personally involved in the purchase of weapons or chemicals. His association with the other accused, accordingly, in a “training” situation is quite important to the Crown case. 
     
      
    37 The overall approach of Khaled Cheiko’s defence is to limit his involvement in the alleged conspiracy. Therefore, I think that evidence of his identification as a person present at this camp, in that context, must also be said to be of reasonably high probative value. In a entirely circumstantial case, evidence of this kind can, in an important way, affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of a fact in issue. This relates to both his physical acts and to his state of mind. In the case of Moustafa Cheikho, it is true that he had already been identified by Ms Bodkin as the driver of the vehicle, and the person who had paid her the money on the relevant day. That may, in one sense, lessen the importance of the evidence, but it does not lessen the probative value of the evidence of his subsequent identification by Mr Cooley. I consider, overall, that the evidence of his identification as a person in attendance at this camp remains of reasonably high probative value.  
     
      
    38 Mr Button fairly accepted that it would have a degree of probative value, but I think that the value of the evidence is higher than counsel was prepared to concede. Neither counsel had anything to say about the nature of the charge involved here. It is obviously of the highest seriousness. The offence carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. In both Dally and in Camileri the Court of Criminal Appeal has emphasised the importance of this consideration.  
     
      
    39 An important consideration here relates to the nature of the contraventions. It was not argued that they were deliberate, and indeed the evidence plainly shows that to be so. It was but faintly argued by Mr Lange that they were reckless, in the sense stipulated by the section, but it was certainly put by both counsel that the actions of Snr Constable Toohey, in particular, were negligent.  
     
      
    40 I have had occasion in earlier decisions in this trial, and for that matter in The Queen v Lodhi, where issues of this kind had been raised, to note that there are justifiable criticisms that can be levelled at the investigating authorities because of a failure to properly coordinate investigative activities conducted on a joint basis between the New South Wales Police and Federal Police. In many instances this had resulted in New South Wales Police simply being unaware of the provisions of the Crimes Act 1914. In other situations, and this is a very good example of it, we here have a Federal Agent who was present, but because he was taking a subordinate role and really leaving it to the New South Wales police officer to conduct the procedures, no attempt was made to contemplate or consider drawing Senior Constable Toohey's attention to the provisions of section 3ZP of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
    41 Some responsibility must also be laid at the feet of those who were involved in sending the photos through. I can only assume that it did not occur to any of those persons that there might be some requirement in the Commonwealth legislation that needed to be addressed.  
     
      
    42 But, overall, the view I take is that, while there was a degree of carelessness here, and I am critical of the police for that, I certainly do not consider it was deliberate, and I do not consider that it was reckless. In particular, I do not think that there was any intention or attempt by the police to deny these men the rights that were available to them under the Crimes Act 1914 and, importantly, I do not think that there is any real suggestion in the overall submissions that the integrity of the identification process was affected in this matter by the failure to have separate photographic arrays prepared and presented. Mr Cooley did not have the slightest difficulty in identifying the four men he nominated as being at the camp. Ms Bodkin was very clear and definite in her identification of Moustafa Cheikho. 
     
      
    43 Both of the identifying witnesses had no problem at all in identifying the persons they picked out, and I do not think that there can be any suggestion that, if the proper procedures had been followed, any different result would have occurred.  
     
      
    44 It is not irrelevant, I think, to note that, certainly so far as Mr Waterstreet was concerned, as of yesterday he was prepared to concede that his client had been at the camp, although, as Mr Button said, if the evidence should be excluded, that is if the Crown has not discharged the onus it carried of satisfying the Court that the evidence should be admitted, then there was no reason why his client should not be entitled to take advantage of that situation. The point I am making perhaps is a broader one. It is that this identification issue has really only come up at the last minute, as it were, during the trial. Prior to yesterday when the point arose, it had been tacitly accepted that both Khaled Cheikho and Moustafa Cheikho were present at this camp at Mulga Creek.  
     
      
    45 The only relevance of these latter considerations is that they go to reinforce the conviction I have that the integrity of the process was not in fact affected by the failure to comply strictly with s 3ZP. I certainly would not classify the breaches as technical or trivial, but I do not think that they were so serious as to warrant this reasonably important evidence being excluded on the trial of this offence, serious as it is.  
     
      
    46 I do not think that there is any need to refer to any of the other particular subsections of s 138(3) of the Evidence Act. I accept that the identification processes could have been carried out without contravention of the laws. I accept, as Mr Button has argued, that the police could have sent through booklets in the proper form to enable the section to be complied with. But, overall, it is my view that the contraventions occurred, essentially, through ignorance and inadvertence, rather than as a result of considerations of practicality or timing.  
     
      
    47 I do not imagine that any proceedings of a disciplinary kind have been, or are likely to, be taken in relation to the contravention or contraventions, but I would like to draw the attention of the police to this decision. I ask that the Crown arrange for a copy of this decision to be made available to the relevant authorities. It is quite clear that there needs to be tuition and co-ordination at a high level so that police officers of both State and Federal persuasion understand the requirements of this rather complex legislation and endeavour to meet those requirements in future cases. There is also a strong argument to say that these procedures should be made uniform as between the Commonwealth and the States.  
     
      
    48 All that, however, is rather beside the point. I simply repeat that so far as the matters in s 138(3) are considered, having considered all of the relevant matters, it is clear to me that the Crown has comfortably established that the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighs the undesirability of admitting it, notwithstanding the breaches or possible breaches which may have occurred.  
     
      
    49 In those circumstances, I hold that the evidence should not be excluded and may be admitted at trial.

     Judgment 
      
      
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    2 On the question whether the appellant’s failure to stop could be taken into account as an aggravating factor in relation to the offence of dangerous driving occasioning death, I would note that the moral culpability of an offender in relation to that offence can vary enormously, not least because of different degrees of mens rea that may be involved.  
     
      
    3 On the one hand, the dangerous driving may be a momentary aberration in the conduct of a person who is otherwise properly concerned to observe the requirements of the law and properly concerned about the safety of other persons. On the other hand, it may be conduct carried out in disregard for the requirements of the law and disregard for the safety of other persons.  
     
      
    4 Failure to stop after an accident so severe that it occasions death is a strong indication that the dangerous driving itself falls into the latter rather than the former category. The failure may be explained in terms of panic; but in my opinion, even with that explanation, it would still remain relevant, albeit that it may be given less weight as an indication of the moral culpability of the offender in relation to the dangerous driving.  
     
      
    5 There is nothing in the sentencing judge’s reasons to suggest that he took the failure to stop into account as an aggravating factor in relation to the offence of dangerous driving occasioning death otherwise than by way of what it indicated concerning the moral culpability of the offender in relation to that offence.  
     
      
    6 JAMES J: I agree with Price J.  
     
      
    7 PRICE J: This is an application by Michael John Shumack, the applicant, for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentences imposed upon him in the District Court. The applicant had been arraigned upon an indictment containing one count of dangerous driving occasioning death contrary to s 52A(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900 (‘the first count’) and one count of failing to stop and assist after a collision occasioning death contrary to s 52AB(1) of the Crimes Act (‘the second count’). The applicant pleaded not guilty. Following a trial lasting two weeks, the jury found him guilty of each count.  
     
      
    8 On 3 December 2007, the applicant was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
      On the first count, imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years to date from 15 October 2007 and to expire on 14 October 2011 with an additional term of 2 years to expire on 14 October 2013. 
       
       
      On the second count, imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3 years to date from 15 October 2009 and to expire on 14 October 2012 with an additional term of 2 years to expire on 14 October 2014.  
       
       
      As a result of partial accumulation, the total effective sentence was imprisonment for 7 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. The earliest date that the applicant is eligible for release to parole is on 14 October 2012. 
       
      
     The applicant was disqualified from driving for a period of 3 years.  
     
      
    9 The applicant relies on the following grounds: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The learned sentencing judge erred by imposing “double punishment” in finding that the offence of dangerous driving occasioning death was aggravated by the fact that the applicant failed to stop after the accident which constituted the gravamen of the second offence for which he fell to be sentenced specifically failing to stop after an accident. 
       
      
    Ground 2: The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.  
     
      
       
      Relevant legislation  
       
      
    10 Section 52A(1)(c) relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        52A  
        (1)  
        Dangerous driving occasioning death 
         A person is guilty of the offence of dangerous driving occasioning death if the vehicle driven by the person is involved in an impact occasioning the death of another person and the driver was, at the time of the impact, driving the vehicle 
        
       
      
     … (c) in a manner dangerous to another person or persons. 
     
      
       
        
        A person convicted of an offence under this subsection is liable to imprisonment for 10 years.” 
        
       
      
    11 Section 52AB(1) of the Crimes Act provides : 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        52AB Offence of failing to stop and assist after vehicle impact causing death or grievous bodily harm 
        
       
      
      
     
      
        
      (1) A person is guilty of an offence if:  
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) a vehicle being driven by the person is involved in an impact occasioning the death of another person, and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the person knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the vehicle has been involved in an impact occasioning the death of, or grievous bodily harm to, another person, and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) the person fails to stop and give any assistance that may be necessary and that it is in his or her power to give.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
      Maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years.”  
       
      
    12 Section 52AB commenced on 13 February 2006. The present offence was committed on 15 September 2006. 
     
      
       
      Facts  
       
      
    13 The facts are not in dispute. The Judge found as to the circumstances of the offences: 
     
      
       
        
        At about 7.43pm [on 15 September 2006] the victim, Ashleigh Harriss, had been walking along Horsley Drive, a short distance behind her two friends, Jessica Brown and Albinas Lenartas. As Ms Brown and Mr Lenartas stepped off the kerb to cross the road Ms Brown said she noticed a car at the roundabout coming towards them. She yelled out to her friends to hurry up and she commented “I thought we were going to get hit and that we were in danger”. She said her impression was that the car was driving at high speed and it appeared to be almost going down the centre of the road. She said it only took the car seconds to get from the roundabout to where they were. She said as she saw the car approach closer she began to run a bit faster. She said she was just over half way across the road when she heard a loud noise and the shattering of glass.  
        
       
       
        
        Mrs Dandridge and her daughter, Kristy Lee Dandridge, gave evidence that they were sitting in their car parked across the road from number 31 Horsley Drive. Mrs Dandridge observed the first two young persons crossing the road and noticed a car coming down from the roundabout moving very fast. She saw the victim walk out and the car hit her. She heard two different sounds and the breaking of glass. She said the victim went up in the air and her hands went up and she went straight back. She said she was expecting the driver of that vehicle to pull over. At a point approximately three to four houses down the road she noticed the vehicle’s brake lights go on for a few seconds and then the car sped off. Kristy Lee Dandridge made similar observations and immediately went to the victim’s assistance. She then went to a nearby residence to get help.” 
        
       
      
    14 The Judge was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Ms Harriss had made her way onto the roadway from the kerb crossing in the same manner as her two friends when she attempted to turn and retreat in the direction of the kerb, and in that manoeuvre she was struck by the car.  
     
      
    15 As to the second count his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The jury’s verdict meant that despite the offender being aware his car had impacted on its front nearside with Ms Harriss, sending her up onto and along the bonnet, aerial and left front windscreen pillar, and causing him to slow his vehicle, he nevertheless made a conscious decision not to 
          
        stop and render assistance.” 
        
       
      
    16 Prior to the collision the applicant had consumed five schooners of beer at a club and two stubbies of Tooheys Extra Dry at the home of his former de facto wife. Dr Judith Perl, a pharmacologist, had given evidence during the trial that the applicant’s minimum blood alcohol reading at the time of the collision would have been 0.1 grams per 100 millilitres of blood. The Judge was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the applicant was the driver of the vehicle at the time of the impact and was driving in a manner dangerous as a result of a combination of factors: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        1. He was driving under the influence of alcohol so that he lacked the full capacity to control and manage his motor vehicle; 
        
       
       
        
        2. That he drove at an excessive speed along the street given the 50 kilometre [per hour] speed limit; 
        
       
       
        
        3. That he failed to keep a proper lookout, not slowing for Ms Brown and Mr Lenartas as they had to hurry on out of his path before the car struck Ashleigh Harriss.” 
        
       
      
    17 Ms Harriss was 16 years old when she died.  
     
      
     Subjective circumstances  
     
      
    18 The Judge made findings concerning the subjective circumstances of the applicant which were taken into account as mitigating factors under s 21A(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. His Honour found that the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) was 33 years old at the time of the offence and was at sentence 35 years old; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) had no prior criminal history and what could only be described as a relatively minor traffic record; 
        
       
      
     (c) was a person of prior good character; 
     
      
     (d) was unlikely to re-offend; 
     
      
       
        
        (e) had good prospects of rehabilitation which his Honour said “must be so given his prior good character, his previous work record and the continued support of his family.” 
        
       
      
    19 A reference tendered to the Judge disclosed that the applicant had been employed by M & E Engineering Proprietary Limited since May 2005 and had an exemplary work history. He was described by the managing director of the company as a conscientious, pleasant, reliable and valued team member who would be offered employment when the matter resolved. 
     
      
    20 It had been the applicant’s case at trial that he was not the driver of the vehicle which had collided with Ms Harriss. During the proceedings on sentence, the applicant’s counsel informed the Judge that “there is no remorse in this case and my instructions have never changed.” The Judge found that the applicant “continued to exhibit a lack of remorse.”  
     
      
    Dealing with the appeal  
     
      
      Ground 1: The learned sentencing Judge erred by imposing “double punishment” in finding that the offence of dangerous driving occasioning death was aggravated by the fact that the applicant failed to stop after the accident which constituted the gravamen of the second offence for which he fell to be sentenced specifically failing to stop after an accident. 
       
      
    21 The Judge considered on the first count the guideline judgment in R v Whyte (2002) 55 NSWLR 252; 134 A Crim R 53 and made reference to the aggravating factors in Whyte. His Honour found in the present case:  
     
      
       
        
        “… that the offender was driving under the influence, that speed was a factor, that Ms Harriss, Ms Brown and Mr Lenartas were all at risk and that the offender  
        failed to stop. 
        ” (italics added)  
        
       
      
    22 And further: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        When scrutinising the present facts, with particular reference to the abovementioned aggravating factors, my assessment is that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his conduct so that his moral culpability was high.”  
        
       
      
    23 The core of the applicant’s complaint is that in regarding failing to stop as a matter of aggravation in his consideration of the first count, his Honour offended the principles against double punishment. The applicant pointed out that the offence of failing to stop contrary to s 52AB of the Crimes Act was introduced by the Crimes Amendment (Road Accidents) (Brendan’s Law) Act 2005 on 13 February 2006 whereas the Whyte guideline was delivered on 20 August 2002. It was submitted that in any case where the offence of failing to stop contrary to s 52AB of the Crimes Act is prosecuted on indictment, Whyte has been superseded with respect to the list of aggravating factors and regard ought not to be had to “failure to stop”. To do otherwise incurs, the applicant submitted, the real risk that the offender will be doubly punished. What has happened, the applicant contended, is that the error complained of has had the effect of increasing the objective seriousness of the first count and yet the criminality of the action is wholly reflected in the second count. He has, in other words, suffered double punishment.  
     
      
    24 The Crown argued that this is not an instance where the applicant has been doubly punished for a single act. There is not, the Crown contended, a common element in the offences an act which both the sentences imposed could be said to punish. They were distinct offences with different elements. The convictions were for separate violations, the first of the community’s right to punish those who drive in a manner which is dangerous, in the second the focus is society’s abhorrence to those who injure their fellow citizens and then abandon them to die. The Crown submitted that the legislative purpose behind the enactment of s 52AB(1) is not merely to punish the failure to stop, but also the failure to render assistance.  
     
      
    25 During the proceedings on sentence, no submission was made by the Crown that the failure to stop was to be taken into account as an aggravating factor on the first count. The Crown’s submission before the Judge was confined to the speed of the vehicle, the number of persons at risk and the degree of intoxication. It is, however, well established that the Crown is not bound on an appeal by the position taken by a Crown Prosecutor in the court below: Ahmad v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 177; R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561.  
     
      
    26 “Failing to stop” and “Degree of sleep deprivation” were added by Spigelman CJ at [217] in Whyte to the list of aggravating factors for offences contrary to s 52A(1) and s 52A(3) of the Crimes Act which had been identified at [231 B-C] in the guideline in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209, 101 A Crim R 259. After Whyte these factors are: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Extent and nature of the injuries inflicted. 
        
       
      
     (ii) Number of people put at risk. (iii) Degree of speed.  (iv) Degree of intoxication or of substance abuse. (v) Erratic driving. (vi) Competitive driving or showing off. 
     
      
       
        
        (vii) Length of the journey during which others were exposed to risk. 
        
       
      
     (viii) Ignoring of warnings. (ix) Escaping police pursuit. (x) Degree of sleep deprivation. (xi) Failing to stop. 27 As was said by Mason P at [33-34] in R v Errington 157 A Crim R 553:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        These factors engaged the second limb of the guideline in R v Jurisic as reformulated in Whyte at [228] – [229] as follows:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          228. In the above list of aggravating factors, items (iii) – (xi) are frequently recurring elements which directly impinge on the moral culpability of the offender at the time of the offence. Individually, but more often in some combination, they may indicate that the moral culpability is high. One way of expressing such a conclusion is to ask whether the combination of circumstances are such that it can be said that the offender has abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. That is not the only way of expressing such a conclusion. 
           
          229. The guideline for offences against s 52A(1) and s 52A(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 for the typical case identified above should be: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              Where the offender’s moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate. 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The nine identified factors refer to the conduct of the offender, as distinct from background subjective factors. Speaking of them, Spigelman CJ said (in Jurisic at 231; 277, restated in Whyte at [218]): 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              The presence of these latter factors may indicate that the offender may have abandoned responsibility for his or her own conduct. When the presence of such a factor can be so described, then it can be said to be present to a material degree for purposes of determining an appropriate sentence.” 
               
                
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    28 In the present case, the presence of the failure to stop was identified by the Judge in combination with the applicant’s degree of intoxication, the degree of speed and the number of people who had been put at risk as indicating that the applicant had abandoned responsibility for his own conduct. His Honour determined that the applicant’s moral culpability for the offence was high.  
     
      
    29 The High Court in Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610 considered the issue of double punishment. The indictment charged the offender with maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act and with breaking and entering the dwelling house of the same victim and, while therein, inflicting grievous bodily harm on him contrary to s 110 of the Crimes Act. McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ stated (at 623 [40]): 
     
      
       
        
        “To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common.” 
        
       
      
    And (at 623 [42]): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear in this case that a single act (the appellant’s inflicting grievous bodily harm on his victim) was an element of each of the offences under ss 33 and 110. The identification of a single act as common to two offences may not always be as straighforward. It should, however, be emphasised that the inquiry is not to be attended by ‘excessive subtleties and refinements’. It should be approached as a matter of common sense, not as a matter of semantics. 
        
       
       
        
        The trial judge sentenced the appellant to identical terms of imprisonment on counts 9 and 10 and made those sentences wholly concurrent. We can only conclude that the sentence on each of those counts contained a portion which was to punish the appellant for his inflicting grievous bodily harm on his victim. Prima facie, then, he was doubly punished for the one act.”  
        
       
      
    30 It was the single act of inflicting grievous bodily harm for which the offender was doubly punished in Pearce.  
     
      
    31 In Dudko (2002) 132 A Crim R 371 this Court dealt with the issue of double punishment. The appellant had been charged with rescuing an inmate in lawful custody by force contrary to s 32 of the Correctional Centres Act 1952 and assaulting a member of a crew of an aircraft contrary to s 206(a) of the Crimes Act. The first charge, ‘rescue by force’ involved conduct that was the subject of the assault, the second charge. The appellant argued that because a single act of force was common to both the rescue of the inmate and the assault on the pilot, there was a resulting “double conviction” or “double punishment”. Spigelman CJ with whom Simpson J and Blanch AJ agreed said at [109]: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        So here the gist or gravamen of the offence under s 32 of the Correctional Centres Act is the rescue, whereas the gist or gravamen of the offence under s 206 of the Crimes Act is the diversion of a pilot from his functions and duties, that is, the hijack. That the element of force in one and the element of assault in the other was, apparently, said to be constituted by the same conduct, does not detract from the proposition that there were two quite distinct offences. In my opinion, there was no double conviction or double punishment.” 
        
       
      
    And at [113]: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I have indicated above, the gravamen of the two offences in this case was quite distinct. Although both offences carried maximum penalties of 14 years, in one case the focus was on a rescue by force and in the other case, on a hijack by threat. Even though the force and the threat was constituted by the same act, it cannot be concluded in this case, unlike Pearce , that the appellant has been ‘doubly punished for a single act’. In Pearce, the single act was the infliction of grievous bodily harm. That was much more than simply an element of the offence, it was the gist or gravamen of the criminal behaviour. In the present case the gist or gravamen of the criminal behaviour was not the same in the two offences. In my opinion it is not correct to say that there was a double punishment 
          
        on the facts of this case.” 
        
       
      
    32 For an offence contrary to s 52A(1)(c) the act which constitutes the offence is the driving of a vehicle at the time of the impact causing death in a manner dangerous to another person. The gravamen of the offence has been identified as being “…not just dangerous driving, but doing so in association with the causing of death of one human being”: Mason P in Errington at [45]; see also R v Hallacoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 at 75; 63 A Crim R 287 at 294. A failure to stop is not a necessary element of the offence nor does the section contain any provision for punishment for it. Where the facts disclose in an offence of driving in a manner dangerous causing death (or inflicting grievous bodily harm) a failure to stop, the relevance of that factor is confined to an assessment of the abandonment of responsibility (moral culpability) by the offender. It was in this way that the Judge considered on the first count the failure to stop in combination with the degree of intoxication, the degree of speed and the number of people who had been put at risk.  
     
      
    33 For a s 52AB(1) offence, the relevant acts which constitute the offence are the failure to stop and give any assistance necessary that is in the driver’s power to give. The failure to stop is a necessary element of the offence. It is the failure to stop and give assistance in circumstances which the driver knows, or ought reasonably to know, that the vehicle has been involved in an impact occasioning death or grievous bodily harm that is the gravamen of this offence.  
     
      
    34 The gravamen of the criminal behaviour in the two offences is not the same. This is not a case where the applicant has suffered double punishment for a single act. In my opinion, the first ground of appeal has not been established.  
     
      
    Ground 2: The sentences imposed were manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    35 The applicant contended that the sentence imposed on each count was manifestly excessive. It was argued in respect of the first count that the sentence was double that of the guideline in Whyte.  
     
      
    36 Spigelman CJ said at [229] in Whyte:  
     
      
       
        
        “The guideline for offences against s 52A(1) and s 52A(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 for the typical case identified above should be: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Where the offender’s moral culpability is high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than three years (in the case of death) and two years (in the case of grievous bodily harm) would not generally be appropriate.’”  
          
         
        
       
      
    37 The guideline of a head sentence of not less than three years (in the case of death) is postulated on the characteristics of a typical case which include “genuine remorse” and a “plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value”: Spigelman CJ in Whyte at [204]. In the present case the applicant had pleaded not guilty and no remorse was demonstrated. As the Chief Justice emphasised in Whyte at [232] the guideline is a “guide” or a “check” and the sentence imposed “in a particular case will be determined by the exercise of a broad discretion taking into account all of the factors required to be taken into account by s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act”. Each case depends on its own circumstances.  
     
      
    38 In the present case, the applicant whilst driving under the influence of alcohol and at an excessive speed caused the fatal injuries to Ms Harriss. His moral culpability was of a high order. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 10 years. The Judicial Commission sentencing statistics as well as a number of sentences imposed in other cases to which the Court was referred do not persuade me that the sentence was manifestly excessive. The sentence imposed for the first count was, in my opinion, within the discretionary range open to his Honour.  
     
      
    39 The applicant submitted that the sentence imposed for the second count was manifestly excessive. I reject this argument. The Judge found that the impact of the vehicle sent Ms Harriss up onto and along the bonnet, aerial and left front windscreen pillar causing the applicant to slow his vehicle. Notwithstanding the force of the impact the applicant made the decision not to stop and render assistance to her. Ms Harriss had sustained a deep impact injury to the left thigh causing the fracture of her pelvis in several places and fatal head injuries.  
     
      
    40 It was next contended by the applicant that the Judge failed to consider the issue of totality with the result that the ultimate sentence was manifestly excessive.  
     
      
    41 During the proceedings on sentence, the Judge informed counsel that there would be a partial accumulation of sentences to which the applicant’s counsel responded: 
     
      
       
       
       
        
        “… I can’t argue for better than that.” 
        
       
       
       
      His Honour in his sentencing remarks expressly referred to the principle of totality and determined that there was a need for “some accumulation”. As a result of the partial accumulation on the sentence imposed for the first count, the effective non-parole period for the second count was 12 months. It is evident that his Honour carefully considered the issue of totality.  
       
      
    42 In my view, the overall sentence, although a stern sentence, was within a permissible sentencing range.  
     
      
    43 I propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed.  
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              **********

      2007/5781 R v Danielle STEWART 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 14 July 2008 Danielle Stewart was arraigned on an indictment which charged that on 23 August 2006 she murdered Chaim Kimel. She pleaded not guilty to this charge and a trial ensued. On 11 August 2008, the jury, by a majority of 11 to one, entered a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. 
     
      
    2 The background of the matter is as follows. The deceased, Chaim Kimel, was the offender's husband. They married in September 2004 but their relationship commenced some years earlier. There was a considerable age difference between them. In 2006 the offender was 30 years old and the deceased was 55. I shall be saying more about their relationship a little later, but it was clearly at times a highly volatile one. 
     
      
    3 I shall commence with the events of 23 August 2006. At that time the offender and the deceased were living in an apartment in New South Head Road, Rose Bay, together with the deceased's 16-year old son, Jordan. It was a Wednesday, and both the deceased and the offender had been at work during the day. They came home separately late in the afternoon. Not long afterwards they left to drive to the home of their friends, Harley and Angela, at Bellevue Hill. The four of them had a glass of wine together and then left to go to a restaurant in Rose Bay. The offender and the deceased arrived at the restaurant before the others and drank a bottle of wine between the two of them before their friends arrived. A further bottle was consumed whilst all four of them were eating their meal. They left the restaurant at about 8:30pm. The deceased accompanied their friends back to their Bellevue Hill home while the offender drove back to the Rose Bay apartment. Jordan was there at the time, and described her as “a little intoxicated” when she arrived. 
     
      
    4 Not long after the deceased telephoned the offender and asked her to join him at their friends' home. She left shortly afterwards and drove to Bellevue Hill. There the four of them sat and chatted and drank red wine. The offender must have consumed a considerable quantity of wine whilst there, given her subsequent very high blood alcohol reading, for she drank no further alcohol after she left the Bellevue Hill home, which was at about 10:30pm. 
     
      
    5 For some reason, which remains unexplained, the offender drove home on her own leaving the deceased to walk home. Jordan was on his computer when she arrived. He described her as appearing “very intoxicated”. The offender logged into her own computer shortly afterwards. 
     
      
    6 The deceased arrived home about ten minutes later. Jordan said that the offender was at that time playing music very loudly through the computer speakers. The deceased turned the music down and the offender immediately turned it back up. This happened on several occasions. Jordan described the offender has becoming agitated, and he sensed an argument brewing, so he went into his bedroom and shut the door. 
     
      
    7 At 11 minutes past 11 the offender rang her grandmother, with whom she was very close, and spoke to her for about ten minutes. While she was on the phone the deceased changed the password enabling access to his business website. Shortly afterwards Jordan heard screaming and yelling between the offender and the deceased. The offender was calling out: ""You fucking barred me out of the computer"". The deceased said: ""There's no need to get violent"". A number of neighbours also gave evidence of hearing loud screaming, which apparently went on for several minutes. 
     
      
    8 At some stage the offender and the deceased moved into the hallway outside Jordan's bedroom. Jordan heard the sound of punching immediately outside his door followed by the thud of a body hitting the door. He assumed, because of the force of the impact, that it was his father striking the door. I should interpolate here that the deceased at the time weighed about 110 kilograms, which was approximately double the body weight of the offender. 
     
      
    9 Jordan then heard the noise of someone, presumably the offender, hitting the ground, as the noise was accompanied by her scream. Moments later he heard his father call out: ""Are you crazy? What are you doing? Are you crazy?"" Shortly afterwards his father emitted a large scream of pain. At this point Jordan opened the door and saw his father in the hallway holding his hands across his stomach. His hands and his shirt were covered in blood. The offender was holding an antique knife in her hand. Almost immediately afterwards, at 11:38pm, the deceased made a triple-0 call in which he said he had been stabbed by his wife. He was taken by Jordan and others to the ground floor of the building. The ambulance arrived shortly afterwards and took him to hospital. Emergency surgery was performed, but he died on the operating table. A post-mortem examination showed that he had sustained two major stab wounds to the abdomen. 
     
      
    10 In the meantime the offender had thrown business records and a computer onto the floor outside the apartment and then locked herself into the apartment. She refused to open the door for the police, and they eventually had to break it down. She was behaving extremely irrationally at the time, and they concluded that she must be under the influence of alcohol or drugs. They were sufficiently concerned about her condition to have her eventually placed in an ambulance and taken to the Prince of Wales Hospital. There she was behaving in such an agitated and aggressive manner that hospital staff were unable to take blood tests in order to determine whether she had taken an overdose of drugs. It was only after she was administered two separate doses of Diazepam that she finally settled so that a blood test could be taken. This showed a reading of .203 grams of alcohol per 100ml of blood. She also had 1.3ml of Quintepine in her blood. Quintepine is the main ingredient of the drug Seroquel. 
     
      
    11 Dr Allender calculated that at the time of the stabbing the offender's likely blood alcohol reading was .240. He said that at that level all people, including regular drinkers who have greater tolerance than others, would be impaired. Their cognitive skills would be greatly impaired, inhibitions would be removed so that aggressive tendencies would be brought to the forefront. As to the Seroquel, Dr Allender said it was not possible to work backwards and calculate the amount of drug in the bloodstream at an earlier time. Seroquel, he said, is an antipsychotic drug, and 1.3ml is more than double the therapeutic dose. A combination of a high level of Seroquel and alcohol he said could significantly impair a person's memory of events which occurred whilst they were affected. This is of real significance in this case because I accept that the offender has no memory whatsoever of the stabbing, nor of the events immediately leading up to it. 
     
      
    12 The Crown has submitted that there is a real possibility that the offender took at least part of the Seroquel after the stabbing. There is no firm evidence either way on this, although the offender told Dr Allnutt that she took large quantities of Seroquel before the stabbing, and I am inclined to accept this. Ultimately it makes little difference in my view. If she did take some of the drug after the stabbing, it was certainly not for any forensic purpose. She was much too agitated to be calculating in her actions at that time. In any event, the jury's verdict means that by reason of the offender's intoxication, be it from alcohol alone, or from a combination of alcohol and drugs, she lacked the requisite intention for murder. I will be returning to discuss this later. 
     
      
    13 At this point I turn to discuss the offender's background. She is now 32 years old, having been born in January 1976. She had a particularly difficult childhood. When she was aged 11 her mother died of breast cancer after about three years of illness. The offender had been very close to her mother, and had helped to look after her during her illness. Also at about this time the offender suffered sexual abuse from three separate perpetrators. The last was the worst. It involved forced intercourse, and took place at much the same time as the death of her mother. 
     
      
    14 The offender has a history of self-harm, starting when she was about ten or 11 years old. Professor Quadrio, who provided several reports on behalf of the defence, commented that self-harm in young children is almost invariably associated abuse and/or trauma. 
     
      
    15 Not long after her mother's death the offender's father remarried. His new wife had children of her own, and had little time for the young Danielle. When she was 12 her family sent her to a youth refuge saying that she was out of control. She returned to live with her father and stepmother at various stages during her schooling. However she also spent a great deal of time in refuges, or staying with friends. During this period she became introverted and depressed, and took to alcohol and drugs. She is clearly an intelligent person, and despite her difficulties she achieved sufficiently good grades to go to university. However, she was unable to persist with her studies because of her mental condition. In addition to abusing alcohol and drugs, she developed anorexia nervosa, and at one point her weight went down to 37 kilograms. 
     
      
    16 It is unnecessary to go through the offender's adult life in any detail. Consistent with her borderline personalty disorder, which I shall be discussing shortly, there was little stability in her lifestyle. She had several moves from city to city, or suburb to suburb, and undertook various studies and forms of employment. The offender was close to some of her family members, including her maternal grandmother, her stepsister and her stepbrother. She was devastated when the latter two both died in traumatic circumstances within a relatively short time of each other. 
     
      
    17 In 1999 the offender entered into a relationship with Jason Gooden, who has maintained a friendship with her, and who remains highly supportive of her. It was when Jason was away in Darwin in November 2000 that the offender first met Chaim Kimel. This was a turning point in her life, although she continued her relationship with Jason, at least on an intermittent basis, until the middle of 2002. 
     
      
    18 The offender's relationship with the deceased was a volatile one from the beginning. In January 2001 the offender was admitted to hospital following an overdose of prescription drugs. She complained, amongst other things, of having been sexually abused by her older employer. It is apparent that this must have been the deceased, for on a number of occasions since then the offender has talked about the deceased's sexual demands in the earlier stages of their relationship. In 2001 and January 2002 the offender again took overdoses of prescription tablets and was admitted to hospital. On the last occasion it was the deceased who contacted emergency services when he was unable to raise the offender from her bed. 
     
      
    19 A summary extracted from hospital and police records between January 2001 and April 2006 was in evidence at the offender's trial. This attested to the several occasions, particularly in the early stages of their relationship, when the offender either attempted suicide or threatened to do so. There were also a number of occasions between July 2002 and March 2005 when arguments between the offender and the deceased became so violent that police and/or hospital authorities became involved. On all of these occasions one or both of them was heavily intoxicated. Indeed, it is apparent that throughout their relationship both parties regularly used to abuse alcohol and other recreational drugs. 
     
      
    20 In spite of these problems the relationship endured and they married late in 2004, having a ceremony both in India and in Australia. In early 2005 the offender became pregnant to the deceased but the pregnancy was terminated on the basis that the relationship was not stable enough for them to have a child. Towards the end of 2005 they separated and the offender went to live in Balmain. She commenced an Internet relationship with a man in Melbourne and, at the end of that year, went to Melbourne to meet him. However, she returned to Sydney early in 2006 and resumed her relationship with the deceased. As it transpired, she had become pregnant in Melbourne. The deceased insisted that the pregnancy be terminated, and this took place. However, the offender found it extremely upsetting. 
     
      
    21 Shortly afterwards, in April 2005, she started to seek treatment from a psychotherapist, Dr Rosalind Foy. She first saw Dr Foy on 10 April 2006 and, thereafter saw her almost every week until 22 August, the day before the killing of the deceased. Dr Foy diagnosed her as suffering from borderline personalty disorder. The offender made no mention to Dr Foy of any physical abuse at the hands of her husband, although she did refer to emotional abuse. Dr Foy said she had had highly conflicting feelings about their relationship. On the one hand she had a high level of anxiety or fear about the loss of the relationship, on the other hand she resented what she described as his dominating and controlling behaviour. 
     
      
    22 I think I should interpolate here that the deceased was well aware of the offender's problems, and was apparently highly protective of her. It is very likely that the behaviour which she perceived as controlling or dominating was in fact designed to shield her from her own excesses. 
     
      
    23 The offender's conflicting feelings about the deceased were also conveyed to the other psychiatrists who gave evidence. She told Dr Allnutt that the deceased was funny, exciting, full of energy and intelligent. They had a lot to talk about, and communicated well despite their age difference. She described the relationship as consisting of intense highs and lows. 
     
      
    24 It was Dr Foy who put the offender onto Seroquel. She said in evidence that the offender was making positive steps during the time she was treating her. Both the offender and the deceased were trying to address their alcohol problems. They were drinking less than previously, and had adopted a firm rule of not having any alcohol in the home. This evidence accords with other evidence in the trial, to the effect that there seemed to be more stability in their relationship during the several months leading up to the killing, when the two of them and Jordan were living in the Rose Bay apartment. 
     
      
    25 This takes me to say something about the offender's psychiatric condition. Three psychiatrists gave evidence at the trial; Dr Foy and Dr Allnutt on behalf of the Crown, and Professor Quadrio on behalf of the offender. All agreed that the offender suffers from borderline personalty disorder. Dr Foy and Professor Quadrio described her condition as ""severe"", or ""very severe"". Dr Allnutt did not put it so high. This disorder is generally related to childhood trauma, of which the offender had more than her fair share. Dr Allnutt noted that the offender had made between eight and ten suicide attempts from the age of 12. Also at that age she started to abuse alcohol and other drugs. He described her as having a substance dependence disorder. 
     
      
    26 All the psychiatrists were in general agreement as to how the offender manifested her symptoms of borderline personalty disorder. She had a tendency to volatile relationships, a high level of impulsivity, emotional instability involving extreme mood swings, having a maladaptive way of dealing with difficult situations, self-destructive behaviour, substance abuse, and inappropriate anger. These symptoms of course are not present all the time. In many respects the offender was able to lead a relatively normal, if rather disorganised, life. She is clearly highly intelligent and, as Professor Quadrio commented, would have had great potential were it not for the problems associated with her condition. 
     
      
    27 Professor Quadrio has seen her since her conviction and an updated report was tendered on sentence. The professor noted that the offender's psychiatric status is unaltered in that she still has a severe borderline personalty disorder. However, the issues of substance abuse are now under control because she is in prison. She said that the offender is very slowly learning more adaptive ways of dealing with situations, particularly since she has no access to drugs or alcohol. 
     
      
    28 Professor Quadrio considers that the offender will require lengthy and intensive treatment for her condition. This is not available within the prison system. If she had access to such treatment, Professor Quadrio considered that she would have good prospects for significant recovery over two to five years. She considered that the risk of re-offending was very low, particularly if the offender was engaged in therapy and remained abstinent. She did not regard the offender as a risk to the community, but said that she would be a risk to herself unless and until she receives adequate treatment. 
     
      
    29 The offender has at no stage denied that it was she who inflicted the fatal stab wounds on the deceased. Nor could she in the circumstances, particularly as she has no memory of the events. A number of issues were raised at the trial, including self-defence and substantial impairment. I ruled during the course of the trial that a defence of mental illness was not available. There were three possible scenarios through which the jury was entitled to find her not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter. These were: first, that she lacked the requisite intention for murder; second, partial self-defence; and thirdly, substantial impairment. In my opinion the first of these is by far the most likely, particularly in the light of the evidence as to the offender's state of intoxication at the time and her irrational behaviour shortly afterwards. Both counsel agree with this proposition. Accordingly, the jury's verdict must be taken to reflect a finding that during the course of a physical altercation between them, the offender deliberately stabbed the deceased in the abdomen on two occasions. However, given her intoxication and her general mental state at the time, she lacked the requisite intention for murder. She is therefore to be sentenced on the basis that she committed an unlawful and dangerous act causing death. 
     
      
    30 I turn now to the various factors to be taken into account on sentence. Lengthy and detailed submissions, both written and oral, were presented on behalf of both the Crown and the offender. It is fair to say that in relation to many issues there is a significant divergence between their approaches. Indeed the extent of polarisation between them is, in my experience, most unusual. 
     
      
    31 One of the major issues in dispute between the parties related to the offender's borderline personalty disorder, and most particularly the part which it played in the commission of this offence and the extent of its relevance on sentence. 
     
      
    32 The parties did accept, as a matter of principle, that an offender's mental disabilities may be relevant to sentencing in the following respects:  
     
      
       
        
        (1) moral culpability may be reduced where the disability materially contributed to the commission of the offence, thereby reducing the need for denunciation;  
         
        (2) general deterrence should usually be given less weight where the offender suffered from a mental disability, because such an offender is not an appropriate medium for making an example to others;  
         
        (3) a custodial sentence may be more onerous for a mentally ill person; and  
         
        (4) the level of danger which the person presents to the community necessitate greater consideration being given to specific deterrence. 
        
       
      
    33 Apart from the unavailability in prison of appropriate treatment, according to Professor Quadrio, there is no suggestion that the offender's custodial situation will be more onerous by reason of her disorder. Accordingly, that factor can be put to one side. The other three, however, remain potentially relevant, and were the subject of submissions by both the Crown and the offender. 
     
      
    34 The Crown's primary submission was that the offender's borderline personalty disorder should not be used to mitigate sentence in either of the first or second respects. In this regard the Crown Prosecutor's written submissions quoted a passage from Dr Allnutt's evidence relating to acts done in anger, which the doctor described as a ""normal feeling"". 
     
      
    35 The submissions continued:  
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown submits that your Honour would accept that once the offender was in this angry state, she had the same choice as any angry person, and her choice was to unlawfully kill the deceased. The Crown submits that her borderline personalty disorder was not a causal factor in this unlawful killing."" 
        
       
      
    36 The Crown submissions went on to contrast Dr Allnutt's evidence relating to the offender's anger with portions of Professor Quadrio's evidence in which she expressed the view that the offender, by reason of her borderline personality disorder, might have reached a stage of arousal where she acted effectively without knowing what she was doing. It was submitted that I should prefer Dr Allnutt's evidence and conclude that the offender's borderline personality disorder was not causally related to the stabbing of the deceased, and that her condition should not be taken into account in mitigation of sentence. If, contrary to this submission, I were to prefer Professor Quadrio's evidence, it would mean, according to this submission, that the offender by reason of her condition poses a real danger to the community, with the result that I would then be obliged to consider the protection of the community when determining the appropriate sentence. It was submitted that a decision on this issue would have to be made as part of the sentencing process. 
     
      
    37 I do not accede to this proposition. At least some of the portions of Professor Quadrio's evidence quoted in the Crown submissions must have been rejected by the jury, as they went to the issue of voluntariness. An acceptance of the professor's evidence on these issues would have led to an outright acquittal. Nor was Dr Allnutt's evidence from an overall point of view as simple as would appear from the passage quoted by the Crown. Very significantly, none of the passages referred to in the Crown submissions directly addressed the offender's intoxication at the time. This is because in most, if not all of them, the witnesses were discussing issues as to which intoxication was not a relevant issue. But as both experts agreed, intoxication played a very significant role in the offender's apparently irrational behaviour on the night of the killing, and in the circumstances of the killing itself. 
     
      
    38 In his cross-examination Dr Allnutt agreed that it was fair to say that the offender’s traumatic background contributed to her developing a personalty disorder, which then led to a substance abuse disorder, and then to a compounding of certain aspects of her personalty when she was intoxicated. In other words, it was something of a vicious circle. He agreed that a person who is intoxicated to a level where memory is not being formed will have a significant degree of cognitive impairment. Dr Allnutt considered that, in the absence of alcohol, the offender had the capacity to understand the difference between right and wrong, and the nature and quality of her act. Insofar as Professor Quadrio gave evidence to the contrary I would prefer Dr Allnutt's evidence 
     
      
    39 In my opinion, based on the evidence in the trial, it was the combination of the offender's borderline personalty disorder and her high level of alcohol intoxication which led to her action in stabbing the deceased. Her borderline personalty disorder meant that she had a tendency to volatile relationships, impulsivity, mood fluctuations and angry outbursts. These features were compounded by the very high level of alcohol she had consumed that night, with tragic consequences. 
     
      
    40 In the result, I propose to treat the offender's mental condition as a relevant factor, both in reducing her moral culpability for this offence and in giving less weight to the issue of general deterrence. The reduction, however, will not be a significant one, particularly given the major role played by alcohol in the commission of this offence. 
     
      
    41 This leads me to say something about how I should treat the evidence of the offender's intoxication. The Crown submitted that her intoxication should be treated as an aggravating factor in that she knew she was prone to violent behaviour when intoxicated, yet she proceeded to consume a large quantity of alcohol on the night of the killing. 
     
      
    42 I do not, however, consider it appropriate to treat her intoxication as an aggravating factor, particularly in the light of the other evidence in the case. The Crown submitted that the offender knew that she would become violent when intoxicated and yet she chose to continue drinking on the night of the killing. But this is significantly overstating the position. The offender had drunk excessively on many previous occasions without any episodes of violence. Accordingly, I propose to treat her intoxication as a neutral factor on sentence. 
     
      
    43 The issue of the offender's potential dangerousness still needs to be addressed. And again the Crown and the defence were at odds in relation to this issue. In certain circumstances this matter can be taken into account, not so as to lead to a heavier sentence than would otherwise be appropriate, but to counteract the mitigating effects of an offender's mental disorder. 
     
      
    44 It must be remembered that, in spite of the episodes of violence over the years between the offender and the deceased, the offender has no prior criminal convictions. In my view she does not pose any danger to the public at large. However, if her personalty disorder remains untreated, and she reverts to alcohol and drug abuse, then she might pose a potential danger to a person with whom she is in a close and volatile relationship; and her relationships are likely to be volatile by reason of her condition. 
     
      
    45 Given the narrow ambit of this risk factor, and the fact that it will in all probability be averted if the offender obtains appropriate assistance and treatment, I consider that the protection of the society, or individual deterrence, can effectively be put to one side. 
     
      
    46 I turn now to deal with other factors relevant to sentence. Both parties agree that there are two aggravating factors under s21(A)(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The first is, in terms of paragraph (c), that the offence involved the actual use of a weapon. The weapon in question was an antique knife. This had previously been kept within a sheath as a decorative item on a coffee table in the lounge room of the apartment. It was a relatively short distance from the table to the hallway where I accept the stabbing took place. I conclude that the offender, in her intoxicated state, grabbed hold of the knife and used it to stab the deceased without adverting to the consequences. The use of the knife, as indicated, is an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    47 The second aggravating factor, in terms of paragraph (ea), is that the offence was committed in the presence of a child under 18 years. Although Jordan did not actually see the stabbing, or the events leading up to it, he certainly heard them, as they took place immediately outside his bedroom door. He witnessed the immediate aftermath of the stabbing, and helped tend to his father until the ambulance arrived. It is, I am certain, understating the impact of this episode upon Jordan to say that it was extremely traumatic to him, and will no doubt remain with him for the rest of his life. 
     
      
    48 Technically, paragraph (eb) would also apply, in that the offence was committed in the home of the victim. However, as it was also the offender's home, it is agreed that this factor should be accorded no weight. 
     
      
    49 I turn to the mitigating factors under s21A(3) of the Act. The Crown agrees that two factors apply in this case: First, under paragraph (b), that the offence was not part of a planned or organised criminal activity; and secondly, under paragraph (e), that the offender has no record of previous convictions. The first of these is particularly significant in the circumstances of this case. It is perfectly clear that events happened very quickly indeed, in the heat of an altercation between the offender and the deceased, and at a time when the offender was heavily under the influence of alcohol. 
     
      
    50 Ms Rigg, on behalf of the offender, submitted that six further mitigating factors were applicable in this case. I shall deal with them in turn. The first, which is one of the most controversial, is, pursuant to paragraph (f), that the offender was a person of good character. The Crown submitted that, in the light of the whole of the evidence, it is not open for me to make this finding, for the following reasons: 
     
      
    · her frequent use of drugs, including illegal drugs;· her prior episodes of violence, particularly in relation to the deceased;· prior episodes of damaging property;· drink driving. The offender drove home on the night of the killing with an extremely high blood alcohol reading;· her willingness to make false allegations of sexual assault;· her breaching of bail whilst awaiting trial for murder, leaving her grandmother at risk of losing a bail security of $50,000. 51 Ms Rigg submitted that the offender was indeed a person of prior good character, and that this should be taken into account as a mitigating factor. She submitted that the offender's drug usage and any minor acts of violence were inextricably linked to her mental disorder. The more serious acts of violence were specific to her relationship with the deceased. It was submitted that there was insufficient evidence that the offender had made a false allegation of sexual assault. As for the breach of her bail, this was occasioned by the offender taking an overdose of drugs in an apparent suicide attempt. This in turn was inextricably linked with her mental disorder. 
     
      
    52 I do not propose to deal with these matters in great detail. I do not consider it necessary as part of the sentencing process to make findings on each of the detailed matters raised by the Crown. I should say that I cannot find on the evidence before me that the offender lied about the nature of her relationship with the deceased. As to the other matters, the offender has a personalty disorder which is no fault of her own, and which she is unable to control. This has led to excessive alcohol and drug taking, which has made her prone to acts of violence. Any such violence, outside her relationship with the deceased, has been relatively minor. As to her relationship with the deceased, it was, as I have already said, a volatile one, with occasional violence, in the heat of the moment, being exhibited on both sides. 
     
      
    53 My conclusion is that the offender, by reason of her personality disorder, and under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs, has sometimes exhibited behaviour which is not normally indicative of good character. But these have all been associated in one way or another with her mental condition. I would therefore find it difficult to deprive her entirely of the benefit of this mitigating factor. However, given the circumstances, I will be affording it little weight. 
     
      
    54 I propose to take the next two factors in reverse order, and deal first, under paragraph (h), with the question of whether she has good prospects of rehabilitation. Given that the offender's mental condition substantially contributed to this offence, as well as to any previous antisocial acts, her prospects of rehabilitation are in my view inextricably linked with her obtaining appropriate treatment. Such treatment as she receives in custody is, I accept, unlikely to have any significant effect on her long-term prognosis. 
     
      
    55 I have already referred to Professor Quadrio's opinion that if the offender were to have access to an appropriate treatment program on her release from custody, then she would have good prospects of a significant recovery over two to five years. On the other hand, the treatment described by Professor Quadrio is both intensive and expensive. There is no certainty that the offender would be able to undertake such a program, even assuming her willingness to do so. I think her prospects of rehabilitation are reasonable, but I am not prepared to categorise them as good. Accordingly, I put this factor to one side. 
     
      
    56 A further matter relied upon pursuant to paragraph (b) is that the offender is unlikely to re-offend. I have already discussed this issue. In my view, even without undertaking a rehabilitation program, the circumstances in which the offender is likely to re-offend are so circumscribed that it is, in my view, unlikely to occur. Accordingly, I propose to give her the benefit of this factor. 
     
      
    57 Ms Rigg submits that a further mitigating feature, under paragraph (i), relates to the remorse shown by the offender for the offence. This is only available as a mitigating factor if the offender ""has provided evidence that he or she has accepted responsibility for his or her actions"". It is the Crown's contention that this is not available, because the offender has not accepted responsibility for her actions. In this regard, the Crown's submissions referred, amongst other things, to the manner in which the trial was conducted. I do not propose to deal with this in any detail. The defence at the trial did raise the issue of self-defence, but this is the only respect in which I find that there was anything potentially inconsistent with remorse in the manner in which the defence was conducted. On the other hand, the Crown tendered at the trial a letter written by the offender to the deceased's friend, Angela, only a few weeks after the killing, in which she expressed horror and shame at what she had done to everyone, particularly the deceased's children. Amongst other things she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am so, so, so sorry Angie for putting everyone through this. It should be me that is dead, not Chaim.""  
        
       
      
    58 The Crown submits that the offender has not accepted moral responsibility for this offence but has rather blamed her mental condition. However, I do not perceive this as a significant negative factor, given my finding that the offender's mental condition was indeed partially responsible for her actions. I propose, therefore, to take the offender's remorse into account. 
     
      
    59 I come now to the final matter relied upon by Ms Rigg by way of mitigation, namely, under paragraph (k), that a plea of guilty was offered by the offender. This is a further highly contentious matter. There is no doubt that in April, and again in May 2008, the offender's counsel made lengthy submissions to the Crown seeking that the charge of murder be no-billed and that the matter be dealt with by way of plea of guilty to manslaughter. The first submission, dated 14 April 2008, referred to the offender's intoxication and the likely difficulties that the Crown would have in proving the requisite intent for murder, and in negativing self-defence. It was suggested that, in the absence of proving specific intent, the offender would be found not guilty of murder but guilty of manslaughter on the basis of her commission of an unlawful and dangerous act. The letter also raised the issue of self-defence. If the Crown was unable to disprove both limbs, the offender would be acquitted outright. A partial self-defence would lead to a conviction of manslaughter. It was submitted:  
     
      
       
        
        “The only realistic outcomes of the trial are either the acquittal of the accused or her conviction of manslaughter, with the latter probably the most likely"". 
        
       
      
    60 Miss Rigg's further submission, dated 7 May 2008, apparently followed discussions between herself and representatives of the Crown as to the possible basis upon which the Crown might accept a plea of guilty to manslaughter. The submissions indicated that Ms Rigg had requested that a guilty plea be accepted on the basis of: “The accused’s commission of an unlawful and dangerous act with elements of excessive self-defence present in her actions."" 
     
      
    61 It is apparent that the Crown had indicated that it might accept a reduction of the charge to manslaughter, but only on the basis of excessive self-defence. The purpose of the second submission was to request that this position be reconsidered. 
     
      
    62 It is apparent from a reading of the second submission that the sticking point between the Crown and the defence at that stage related to the offender's intention at the time of the killing. It seems that the Crown was not prepared to accept a plea unless it reflected an admission that the accused intended to kill or really seriously injure the deceased. The accused was not prepared to make such an admission. It was for this reason that she was seeking to plead guilty to manslaughter upon the basis of an unlawful and dangerous act. 
     
      
    63 As all parties now agree, the jury's verdict at the end of the trial reflected its inability to find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender had the requisite intention for murder. She is therefore to be sentenced for an unlawful and dangerous act causing death. This is precisely the circumstance which was proposed on her behalf in both submissions; particular the second one. 
     
      
    64 The authorities make it clear that in the situation which now prevails, the applicant is entitled to a discount for the notional utility of the plea of guilty which she offered, notwithstanding that the offer was not accepted by the Crown. The fact that she chose not to plead guilty of manslaughter in the presence of the jury, and that she raised issues at trial which could have led to an outright acquittal, is irrelevant for these purposes. Had the Crown accepted the plea of guilty offered by the offender a lengthy trial, covering more than four weeks, would have been averted. Ms Rigg submitted that a discount of 20 percent would be appropriate on this account. In my view this is slightly overstating the matter. I propose to allow a discount of 15 percent. 
     
      
    65 The maximum sentence for manslaughter is 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period. This recognises the fact that culpability for manslaughter can vary enormously from, on the one hand, a killing which is little short of murder to, on the other hand, a practical joke gone wrong. The Crown referred to a number of sentences for manslaughter in situations which appeared to raise similar issues to many of those presented here. It must be acknowledged that no two cases will ever really be similar, or involve identical issues, but I have gained some assistance from these cases. 
     
      
    66 It is agreed that it the offender's pre-trial custody is such that her sentence should commence from 25 June 2007. It is also agreed that special circumstances exist so as to break the statutory nexus between the total sentence and the non-parole period. These circumstances primarily relate to the offender's need for treatment, assistance, and supervision upon her release from custody. 
     
      
    67 Before completing these reasons, I want to say something about the very moving victim impact statements which were read in court by the deceased's three children Fred, Amber, and Jordan. These attested to the exceptional qualities of the deceased, to the special relationship that each of them had with him, and to the devastation to each of them caused by his death. This was exacerbated, they said, by the course of the trial. 
     
      
    68 I would like to express the Court's condolences to each of you. I would also like to say something directly to the three of you, and to the other friends and relatives of the deceased who followed this case so closely. I suspect that you will regard the punishment I am about to impose as quite inadequate, given the extent of your loss. And the truth is that no punishment that this Court can impose will ever be capable of redressing your loss. That is not the purpose of punishment. I am sure you will realise, after listening to these reasons, that sentencing is a highly complex process, and there are very many considerations to be taken into account. Achieving an appropriate balance between the punishment of the offender and other factors, including her rehabilitation, is a central part of this process. The sentences imposed by the Court are not intended to reflect, and indeed cannot reflect, the extent of the loss suffered by family and friends, no matter how great that loss may be. I hope you understand this. 
     
      
    69 Were it not for the offender's offer to plead guilty to manslaughter, I would have imposed a total sentence of seven years and six months with a non-parole period of four years and nine months. Given the 15 percent discount for her offered plea, I propose to impose a sentence of six years and four months, with a non-parole period of four years. 
     
      
    70 Danielle Stewart, for the manslaughter of Chaim Kimel, I sentence you to a non-parole period of four years to date from 25 June 2007. The first date on which you will be eligible for release on parole is 24 June 2011. I specify a balance of term of two years and four months, commencing on 25 June 2011 and expiring on 24 October 2013.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: On 31 January 2008 the applicant, Van Cuong Nguyen, pleaded guilty in the District Court at Parramatta before his Honour Judge Williams to an indictment containing the following two counts: 
     
      
       
        
       Count 1 
       : That on 31 May 2007 at Guildford in the State of New South Wales [he] did cultivate a prohibited plant, namely, cannabis plants being not less than the commercial quantity, namely 105 plants; 
        
        
       Count 2 
       : That on 31 May 2007 at Guildford in the State of New South Wales, [he] did supply a prohibited drug, namely, cannabis leaf, in that he had in his possession 3708.7 g of cannabis leaf which amount exceeds the trafficable quantity of cannabis leaf. 
        
       
      
    2 The applicant was sentenced by his Honour Judge Bennett SC in the District Court at Parramatta on 19 March 2008. With respect to Count 2 – supply prohibited drug, his Honour imposed a total sentence of three years and four months with a non-parole period of two years and six months commencing on 31 May 2007 and expiring on 30 November 2009. With respect to Count 1 – cultivate commercial quantity of prohibited plant, his Honour imposed a total sentence of five years, with a non-parole period of three years and six months commencing on 30 November 2007 and expiring on 29 May 2011. Accordingly, the overall sentence for both offences was imprisonment for five years and six months with a non-parole period of four years. 
     
      
       
      
    3 The sentencing judge also had before him a certificate pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW) certifying that the applicant had been charged with four related offences in respect of which his Honour imposed fixed periods of imprisonment that were totally subsumed in the sentences imposed with respect to the charges on indictment. Although the applicant originally sought leave to appeal against the sentences so imposed by his Honour with respect to the related offences, that application was ultimately abandoned. 
     
      
       
        
       The facts 
        
       
      
    4 The facts as found by the sentencing judge were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “The quantity of plants at 105 is 55 greater than the commercial quantity specified for cannabis plants cultivated by enhanced indoor means specified in the Schedule one to the  
         Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
          [1985 (NSW)]. 
         
        
        
         
         The cannabis leaf at 3,708.7 grams is well in excess of the trafficable quantity of 300 grams and is more than three times greater than the indictable quantity specified in that same table. 
         
        
        
         
         The facts are summarised in the document tendered by the Crown. Drawing from that summary, on 31 May 2007 at 7am police attended 12 Oxford Street Guildford where the offender was living at the time. The premises were locked and secured. Police announced their office a number of times after which the offender came to the front sliding door. The front door and all of the windows of the premises were fortified with iron bars. The police attempted to communicate with the offender and asked him to open the sliding door but he quickly closed the blinds and disappeared from view. The police ultimately gained entry to the premises through a side door and upon doing so they saw the offender and a female person inside the premises. He was arrested and both he and the female were escorted into the kitchen area of the building where they were seated. He was cautioned and told that the police were there to execute a search warrant. [His wife remained at] the premises throughout the search. He told the police that he was the owner of the property and admitted to them the setting up of the equipment and the growing of the plants that were discovered inside. 
         
        
        
         
         The search revealed cannabis growing in two rooms. Room one at the rear of the premises had forty-nine cannabis plants of approximately 700 millimetres height, and there were six lamp shades with associated globes and an exhaust fan and filter attached. In room two, also at the rear of the premises, there were fifty-six cannabis plants of approximately the same height, 700 millimetres, twelve lampshades with associated globes, and there was about five kilograms of cannabis leaf and two exhaust fans with filters attached. 
         
        
        
         
         In the laundry the police found a number of chemical fertilisers, $14,750 in Australian currency, twenty-one electrical transformers and a large power board circuit breaker. In the dining and living area documents were found in the name of the offender. 
         
        
        
         
         A representative from Integral Energy attended the premises and told the police that the electricity had been bypassed in the roof space of the house. There were a total of 105 cannabis plants seized, 3708.7 grams of loose cannabis, eighteen lampshades, twenty-one electrical transformers, one power board, three exhaust fans and attached filters and $14,750 seized from the premises. It is said that the entire cannabis crop was valued conservatively at $250,000 at street level. This is calculated upon the basis that 105 cannabis plants, all of which were two months from harvest, were valued between $2,000 and $3,000 each. 
         
        
        
         
         The offender was interviewed at Parramatta Police Station; he made full and accurate admissions in relation to his possession and cultivation of the cannabis plant and the equipment. He declined to make comment in relation to the stealing of electricity, the possession of the cannabis leaf and the money that was seized.” 
         
        
        
       The grounds of appeal 
        
       
      
    5 Three grounds of appeal were pursued. They were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 1 
       : The sentencing judge erred by accumulating six months of the cultivation sentence on the supply sentence; 
        
        
       Ground 2 
       : The sentencing judge erred by applying a 5% discount to the applicant’s plea because of the strength of the prosecution case; 
        
        
       Ground 3 
       : The sentence for the cultivation offence was manifestly excessive and the total sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. 
        
        
       It is convenient to deal first with Ground 2, then Ground 1 and finally Ground 3. 
        
        
       Ground 2: The sentencing judge erred by applying a 5% discount to the applicant’s plea because of the strength of the prosecution case 
        
       
      
    6 Under the heading “The Timing of the Pleas” and after noting that the parties had agreed that the applicant should be sentenced upon the basis that he had entered an early plea of guilty, the sentencing judge said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “As I understand the concession made by the Crown, this will allow him the twenty five percent discount for utility, however as will be made clear when I summarise the facts of this case, the chances of the offender being acquitted at trial are so remote as to be set to one side. The case the Crown had to present was very compelling and I would expect that his conviction would have been inevitable. Accordingly, to the extent that the plea is a reflection of his remorse and contrition the discount to be applied will be only five percent. I will only allow thirty percent overall for the pleas of guilty.” 
         
        
       
      
    7 It was submitted that the above remarks demonstrated that when his Honour was considering the utilitarian value of the applicant’s plea, he took into account the inevitability of his being convicted of the subject offences had he defended the charges. It was submitted that it was well established that the strength of the Crown case was an irrelevant factor in determining the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty, although it was relevant to the evaluation of the offender’s remorse and contrition: R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 at [12].  
     
      
       
      
    8 In the present case the sentencing judge made it clear that he proposed to allow the applicant a 25% discount with respect to the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty to each of the charges. His Honour also correctly recognised, that the applicant’s plea was a demonstration of his remorse and contrition. That a plea is a manifestation of remorse or contrition is also well established: R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 at 386 [3]. 
     
      
       
      
    9 The issue before his Honour was whether there should have been a greater discount of 25% to reflect the applicant’s expression of contrition for his involvement in the offences referred to in the pre-sentence report and as reflected in his plea of guilty. It is in that context that, in my view, his Honour referred to the strength of the Crown’s case as militating against any substantial further discount over and above the 25% to reflect the applicant’s remorse and contrition. He thus allowed only a further 5%. 
     
      
       
      
    10 His Honour was bound by s 22(1)(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) to take into account the fact that the applicant had pleaded guilty. He was further bound by s 21A(3)(i) to take into account as a mitigating factor the remorse shown by the applicant for an offence where he has provided evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions. However, as I have indicated, the weight to be placed upon this factor may well be reduced, as it was in the present case, by the strength of the Crown’s case being one where, according to his Honour, the conviction of the applicant would have been inevitable.  
     
      
       
      
    11 In my view, it is clear that his Honour only took the strength of the Crown’s case into account as reflecting the weight that he was prepared to attach to any question of remorse and contrition on the applicant’s part. In so doing he allowed a further 5% discount over and above the 25% discount that he had allowed for the utilitarian value of his plea. In fact, his Honour ultimately allowed a discount of 33⅓% to take account of the utilitarian value of the applicant’s plea and the mitigating effect of his expression of contrition. 
     
      
       
      
    12 In the foregoing circumstances I cannot detect any error in his Honour’s approach. Ground 2 should therefore be rejected. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 1: The sentencing judge erred by accumulating six months of the cultivation sentence on the supply sentence 
        
       
      
    13 The sentencing judge accepted the submission of the then counsel for the applicant that there should be a partial accumulation of the sentences in respect of the two offences but allowed only a period of six months. The applicant now submits that the overlap between the two offences was such that, in effect, his Honour has imposed double punishment for what in reality was a single act of cultivation.  
     
      
       
      
    14 The foundation for this submission was the rejection by his Honour of the following paragraph in the police Statement of Facts: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “It is the opinion of the Police that although the offender stated that he had been growing the plants for only 3 months, Police would estimate that the offender, had been growing for more than 12 months. Police made this assumption based on indications relating to the large amount of cannabis leaf seized indicating a recent harvest and further suspicion in relation to the $14,750 suggesting that the offender profited from the last Cannabis Harvest.” 
         
        
       
      
    15 As to this paragraph, his Honour remarked as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “In the second last paragraph in the summary of facts, the opinion of the police is expressed in terms that from what was found the offender had been growing cannabis for more than twelve months. This opinion is made upon assumptions they identified but in the circumstances there is not sufficient material before me to conclude beyond reasonable doubt that the opinion offered is entirely accurate and I put that matter to one side. In any event the sophistication of the arrangement and the presence of a significant quantity of cannabis leaf, which I infer as the only rational inference to be drawn was a product of this enterprise, elevates this to an objectively grave pattern of offending.” 
         
        
       
      
    16 The applicant submitted that the “enterprise” to which his Honour referred in the above remarks, was that of cultivating 105 cannabis plants. The inference, it was submitted, was that the 3,708.7g of cannabis leaf seized by the police were the product of those 105 plants or some of them. This was because his Honour had specifically rejected the suggestion that the applicant had been growing cannabis for more than 12 months.  
     
      
       
      
    17 However, in my view that finding was not a rejection of any inference that the applicant had been growing cannabis prior to his commencement to grow the 105 plants. Further, the police Statement of Facts noted that the cannabis plants were only approximately 700mm in height and were two months from harvest. Although they were being hydroponically grown, it is apparent that the plants were relatively immature and, in any event, two months away from being ready to be harvested. 
     
      
       
      
    18 There was no evidence that the cannabis leaf seized by the police was the product of the 105 plants, the subject of the first charge. Nor was there any evidence before his Honour that the cannabis leaf in question was some form of detritus from those plants. The applicant had pleaded guilty to the charge of supplying a prohibited drug (being the cannabis leaf) from which it should be inferred that the cannabis leaf was in such a condition as enabled it to be supplied for an illicit purpose. He had also pleaded guilty to the related offence of dealing with property (being cash in the sum of $14,750 found at the premises where the plants were being cultivated) reasonably suspected of being the proceeds of crime. 
     
      
       
      
    19 Furthermore, weight must be given to his Honour’s finding that the fact that the cannabis leaf was a product of “this enterprise”, elevated the matter “to an objectively grave pattern of offending”. In these circumstances, I do not regard his Honour’s finding that the cannabis leaf was a product of “this enterprise” as intended as a finding that the cannabis leaf was harvested from the 105 plants at a time when their harvesting was still two months away. In argument his Honour, without demur from the applicant’s then counsel, had said: 
     
      
       
        
         
         “But as I see the facts it [the cannabis leaf] is product from the ongoing cultivation.”  
         
        
       
      
    20 In the foregoing circumstances I regard his Honour reference to “this enterprise” as relating to an ongoing enterprise of cultivating cannabis generally, albeit that he was unable to make a finding as to that the period over which that enterprise had been undertaken. The fact that the 105 plants were two months from harvest suggests that the cannabis leaf that was seized may well have come from an earlier harvest rather than from the still-growing plants. 
     
      
       
      
    21 The applicant’s case for asserting that the sentencing judge erred by accumulating only six months of the cultivation sentence upon the supply sentence was entirely based upon the submission that his Honour had found that the cannabis leaf was a product of the 105 growing plants. As I am of the opinion that that was not his Honour’s finding, it follows that no error with respect to the extent of accumulation adopted by his Honour has been demonstrated. I would therefore reject this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
        
       Ground 3: The sentence for the cultivation offence was manifestly excessive and the total sentence imposed was manifestly excessive 
        
       
      
    22 The first count was laid under s 23(2)(a) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act and attracted, relevantly, a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. The second count was laid under ss 25(1) and 29 of that Act and, relevantly, attracted a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. As I have indicated, his Honour imposed with respect to Count 1 a sentence of five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of three years and six months and on Count 2 a sentence of three years and four months imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and six months. As I have also observed, the overall effect of this sentence was one of five years and six months imprisonment with a non-parole period of four years. 
     
      
       
      
    23 With respect to the objective gravity of the offences, the sentencing judge considered that they fell somewhere within the middle range of seriousness. In this respect, it had been conceded before his Honour on behalf of the applicant that he would be hard pressed to submit that the objective gravity of the applicant’s offending was lower than middle range whereas the Crown had submitted that its objective gravity was a little above middle range. Given the submissions of both the applicant and the Crown, it was clearly open to his Honour to find that their objective gravity fell “somewhere about the middle range”. I can perceive no error in that finding in the circumstances referred to. 
     
      
       
      
    24 The applicant made the following further submissions. First, that the Judicial Commission statistics relating to non-parole periods imposed in commercial quantity cannabis cultivation cases suggested that a sentence of 42 months non-parole was more appropriately described as being within the upper range of sentences, whereas a middle range appeared to be a non-parole period of 18 months. However, this Court has said on numerous occasions that the upper limit of the sentencing discretion in any case is the maximum penalty (which in the present case was 15 years), not the highest penalty revealed in the statistics. The relevant statistics are also suspect in the present case. Those titled “s.23 cultivate by enhanced indoor means prohibited plant (cannabis plant – commercial qty): Term of Sentence – consecutive and non-consecutive terms” only comprise 11 cases over a period of 18 months. I do not regard them as being of any assistance in the present matter. 
     
      
       
      
    25 Second, it was submitted that the cultivation of 105 plants did not fall within the upper range of the number of plants sometimes encountered in indoor hydroponic cannabis crops. That may or may not be so, but what is clear is that 105 plants is just over twice the commercial quantity for plants cultivated by enhanced indoor means. Further, the cannabis leaf of 3,708.7g was well in excess of the trafficable quantity of 300g and more than three times greater than the indictable quantity specified in Schedule 1 to the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. This being so, it seems to me that it was clearly open to the sentencing judge to conclude that the objective seriousness of the offences was “somewhere about middle range”.  
     
      
       
      
    26 Third, it was submitted that the total sentence imposed was manifestly excessive because the cannabis leaf was a product of the 105 growing cannabis plants which were the subject of the cultivation charge and thus, applying totality principles, partial accumulation was not appropriate. I have already rejected this submission under Ground 1 and it need not be considered further. In my opinion the Ground 3 should also be rejected. 
     
      
       
        
       The applicant seeks leave to file supplementary submissions with respect to Ground 3 
        
       
      
    27 On the day following the hearing of the appeal, the Court received an unsolicited document from counsel for the applicant containing supplementary written submissions with respect to Ground 3. As leave to file those submissions had not been sought during or at the conclusion of the hearing, such leave was sought in the document. 
     
      
       
      
    28 It is well established, at least in civil appeals, that supplementary written submissions filed after the conclusion of oral argument on the appeal, for which leave has been neither sought nor granted, should be ignored: Carr v Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd [No 1] (1981) 147 CLR 246 at 258 per Mason J; In the matter of an application by the Chief Commissioner of Police (Vic) [2005] HCA 18; (2005) 79 ALJR 881 at 890 [53]-[54] per Kirby J; Dwyer v Commonwealth Bank of Australia (1995) 31 ATR 48; Kirwan v Cresvale Far East Ltd (In liq) [2002] NSWCA 395; (2002) 44 ACSR 21 at [340] per Young CJ in Eq; Chapman v Caska [2005] NSWCA 113 at [19] per Beazley, Giles and Tobias JJA. 
     
      
       
      
    29 As Mason J said in Carr and Kirby J in Commissioner of Police, the notion that supplementary submissions can be filed without leave is misconceived and this is so even if the other party to the proceedings consents.  As I said in Notaras v Waverley City Council [2007] NSWCA 333; (2007) 161 LGERA 230 at 267 [147], with the agreement of Mason P and Hodgson JA, such conduct should not occur. 
     
      
       
      
    30 The time and place to present argument and, if necessary, to seek leave to file supplementary submissions, is during the hearing of the appeal. It is inappropriate to file such submissions after the conclusion of the hearing and to seek the Court’s leave to do so at the same time. Such a practice is to be discouraged and should extend to appeals in criminal matters save in exceptional circumstances. 
     
      
       
      
    31 An example of such a circumstance would be where, after judgment was reserved, an authoritative decision of an appellate court directly on point is handed down. Obviously, it should be brought to the Court’s attention and leave sought, which is likely to be granted, to file a supplementary submission explaining how the new decision might affect the outcome of the appeal. In the present case, what appears to be, with respect, an afterthought of counsel does not so qualify. 
     
      
       
      
    32 It follows that in my opinion the application by counsel for the applicant to file the supplementary submissions contained in the document provided to the Court should be refused. 
     
      
       
        
       Conclusion 
        
       
      
    33 In my opinion each of the three challenges to the sentences imposed by his Honour should be rejected. I would therefore propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      
    (a) Leave to appeal against sentence granted.(b) Appeal against sentence dismissed.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: HA is charged with the manslaughter of her son, EA. He died of pneumonia and pyelonephritis.  
     
      
    2 Pneumonia, as most know, is an acute inflammation and infection of the lungs. Pyelonephritis, relevantly, is an acute infection of the kidneys, usually the result of an infection that has travelled up from the urinary tract.  
     
      
    3 Proper medical care, at the appropriate time, would have prevented EA’s death from these causes. HA (and her late husband) were responsible for their son and were under a duty of care to obtain medical treatment. In the circumstances of this case, while there was no intention to cause their son’s death, or even to cause him harm, the failure to obtain medical treatment involved, to any reasonable person, such a high risk that death would follow, that the failure merits criminal punishment.  
     
      
    Medical History of Victim 
     
      
    4 The victim, EA, was born on 10 February 1999. At birth, the child developed severe jaundice as a result of the incompatibility of his blood group and his mother’s. This required urgent treatment in the form of an exchanged blood transfusion and phototherapy to avoid serious and permanent brain damage. The parents refused to have their child treated for this problem and thus required the attending physician to report the matter to the Department of Community Services (DOCS) to have treatment instituted.  
     
      
    5 The victim was also born with congenital cataracts, which were identified in the neonatal period. The parents were advised that prompt surgical treatment would have offered him the best hope of normal vision. The parents repeatedly denied consent for this operation until DOCS insisted upon treatment being provided. He had the cataract operation in August 1999, at the age of six months. It is unclear whether the cataract operation, performed at this later time, was too late to offer him real hope, but, necessarily, it involved a far lesser opportunity for recovery or normal vision.  
     
      
    6 The victim had severe physical and intellectual disabilities and his nutritional status was extremely poor. He had a complicated medical background, which would, to a reasonable person, have indicated the necessity for regular medical assessment, but the parents seemed to have made no attempt to seek further medical review.  
     
      
    7 The post-mortem findings describe a child that was extremely malnourished. His weight at the time of his eye operation was 8.06 kilograms. At the time of his death his weight was 6.84 kilograms and his height was the equivalent of an average 15-month-old boy. At the time of his death he was 4½ years old. Expert medical assessment and post-mortem examination show that he has severe Osteoporosis, with multiple fractures. This, once more, emphasised the degree of under nutrition from which he suffered.  
     
      
    8 In evidence, before the Court on sentencing, is a number of medical reports. Obviously, there is a report under the Coroners Act 1980, from the Coroner, and there are a series of expert reports from paediatricians dealing with the health of the victim. One such report is the report of Professor Sillence, Professor of Medical Genetics at Westmead Children’s Hospital, which, on the basis of the material before him, concluded that the victim showed a generalised reduction of bone density (severe osteopenia), with multiple fractures. There was no scurvy or Vitamin D deficiency, which would generally tend to indicate malnutrition, and the victim’s appearance, nevertheless, could be due, in part, to global nutritional deficiency. The Professor opines that, on the basis of the bone disorder and the history of cataracts, and otherwise generally on the basis of his medical condition, there was a strong possibility that the victim suffered from a genetically determined disorder, Osteoporosis Pseudoglioma Syndrome, or one of the several other forms of Osteogenesis Imperfecta, with eye involvement.  
     
      
    9 Osteoporosis Pseudoglioma Syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterised by cataracts, progressive changes in the retina leading to retinal dysplasia and mild development delay. There is low muscle tone and the Osteoporosis is usually not recognised until late in the first year of life. There is a progressive and severe generalised Osteoporosis and fractures. The Professor notes that parents and health professionals often underestimate the severity of the condition, as the children complain of pain far less often than one would imagine, as many of the fractures occur progressively, rather than acutely. This is because the bones are so fragile that movement by the child can cause the fractures. The skeletal condition is treatable. The disorder, although rare in Australia and in New Zealand, led, in former years, to respitory failure and death.  
     
      
    10 Children with severe Osteopenia eat poorly, or eat selectively, and their reduced appetite contributes to under-nutrition, which makes their bone disease worse. Osteoporosis is under-diagnosed in children and it can be missed by general practitioners, who are not expecting it to occur in children. There is no childhood screening for Osteoporosis.  
     
      
    11 What is clear from the significant number of expert reports, is that EA suffered from a congenital disorder, which was not properly treated. However, the congenital disorder would not have been easily diagnosed, and would have, most probably, been the predominant cause of the bone density issues and lack of development.  
     
      
    12 Nevertheless, EA’s lack of development and general weakness would have been noticeable, and should have been noticed, by one or both of his parents, and it would have been, once noticed, relatively easily treated. In the words of Professor Roger W Byard, Marks Chair of Pathology, University of Adelaide, “his need for ongoing medical treatment and care would have been obvious.” 
     
      
    13 EA’s lack of development and his malnutrition, described as “obvious and obviously needing treatment”, was not the cause of his death. As earlier stated, EA died from infections. However, it is likely that those infections took hold and/or were as severe as they were because of the underlying congenital issues and the lack of treatment for them.  
     
      
    14 The evidence before the Court is that, at or shortly before the date of EA’s death, all of the family were suffering from the flu and HA thought that her son was also suffering from the flu, rather than the serious infections from which he died.  
     
      
    15 Mr Strahan (Armanaki Ki Tonga George Strahan), who knew the family from church, testified that he saw EA shortly before he died and he did not, at that stage, look sick to him. Indeed, he commented, in that passage of evidence, that EA seemed, at that stage, a normal, happy person and a part of his family (Transcript p 31).  
     
      
    16 The foregoing evidence, from a relatively independent witness, corroborates the view expressed by HA that, other than the flu from which each of her children suffered, she did not notice any greater infection and did not realise the seriousness of the complaint. 17 However I do not regard Mr Strahan’s evidence as corroboration or evidence contradicting the expert evidence, otherwise adduced, to the effect that EA’s lack of development and malnutrition would have been obvious.  
     
      
    HA’s History  
     
      
    18 HA was born in 1973 and, as a consequence, was almost 30 years of age when EA died. She is described in a clinical psychological assessment tendered by the Crown as “a tall, plump woman who was neatly dressed and well-groomed.” 
     
      
    19 HA grew-up in a family consisting of her mother and father and four daughters. She is the third of the daughters. The family was close. The structure of the family was such that it was an unexceptional family background in which there was no heavy-discipline in the family and discipline was effected by “grounding” the girls as a form of discipline. The father worked very hard, sometimes two or three jobs. The mother worked once the girls went into high school. HA left school at the end of the school certificate, in year 10.  
     
      
    20 HA was a fairly religious person, whose involvement with the church commenced when she was in primary school. At that stage, she used to attend church with her sisters, at the Baptist Church in Mortdale. While her parents and sisters dropped-off church attendance, HA continued, joined a youth group and, if anything, increased her church attendance. From time-to-time she would go out, on weekends, with a church group called Shiloh, a youth group with a Maori Minister. They met at someone’s house and went out together.  
     
      
    21 After leaving school, HA commenced a hairdressing apprenticeship but did not complete it. She looked for other work, but was unsuccessful in finding it.  
     
      
    22 When she was 18 she met JA, her husband. They were not legally married, but she subsequently changed her name to adopt his surname. Soon after they met, she became pregnant with their eldest daughter. Because her husband was a Minister, HA returned to church attendance, attending Mortdale Uniting Church. The couple initially lived in a flat and then, once pregnant with their third child, the family moved to a house. There they had two more children. Eventually they moved into housing provided by the Department of Housing.  
     
      
    23 EA was, at the time of his death, one of seven children of HA. At the time of EA’s death, HA was heavily pregnant with what became her eighth child (born 11 September 2003). Since that time, she has had another two children. She is the mother of nine children, currently, and of course, was the mother of the deceased, who was her fifth born child.  
     
      
    24 The evidence is that, generally, HA was a good mother who coped well with a large number of children. There is no doubt that HA loved, and loves, all of her children and saw each of them as a blessing (as she described it).  
     
      
    25 As would probably be obvious, her major duties are looking after her family and, it seems, always was.  
     
      
    26 She described her marriage as a “good marriage” and her husband was not abusive. However, it is clear from the evidence that has been adduced in these proceedings, that her husband was, at the very least, dominating. He certainly was the person who made all the decisions in the household and his will, and the decisions that he made, were always implemented. That statement does not mean that HA did not have the capacity to express a point of view, only that, having expressed that point of view, she was required to implement the decisions that he, her husband, made. He was dominant in every aspect of their life.  
     
      
    27 Both HA and her husband were charged with the offence for which HA stands to be sentenced. Her husband died of a heart attack on 27 January 2008, at a time when HA went into labour to give birth to her last child, who was born on 2 February 2008.  
     
      
    Sentencing 
     
      
    28 The purpose in sentencing any offender, even those charged with manslaughter, seeks to resolve what are often, if not necessarily, conflicting goals. In serious crimes such as manslaughter, the importance of punishment and public deterrence loom large. These include the protection of society, personal and public deterrence, retribution and reform. Each of these factors, particularly the protective nature of sentencing, personal and public deterrence, and punishment, must have regard to the gravity of the circumstances viewed objectively within the range of crimes that may fall within the offence charged. These point most obviously to the factors that require protection of society, deterrence of the offender and of others who might be tempted to offend, and to retribution. Reform or rehabilitation may also be significantly affected by the objective circumstances of the offences, but is a factor affected most obviously by the subjective circumstances and the capacity for rehabilitation. That capacity for, and the likelihood, if any, of, rehabilitation, in turn, impacts upon the degree to which a sentence is fixed, which ensures the protection of society and the personal deterrence of the offender. There is no single correct sentence and the often complicated interplay of considerations point in different directions.  
     
      
    Manslaughter 
     
      
    29 The offence of manslaughter is one for which the maximum available penalty is one of imprisonment for 25 years. The offence involves the felonious taking of human life, and, for that reason, it has been recognised as a most serious crime. Hill v R (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402, R v Woodland [2001] NSWSC 416, per Wood CJ at CL, approved in R v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184 at paragraph 18.  
     
      
    30 The value the community places upon the preservation of human life is reflected by the need to have conduct involved in its taking denounced by a sentence appropriate to the circumstance of the case. R v McDonald (Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, unreported), Woodland supra, Hoerler supra.  
     
      
    31 In R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510, Gleeson CJ (with whom James and Ireland JJ concurred) quoted with approval the following words from an earlier decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Macdonald, supra: 
     
      
       
        
        “In a case such as the present, it is important to bear in mind the denunciatory role of sentencing. Manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life. This may involve a wide variety of circumstances, calling for a wide variety of penal consequences. Even so, unlawful homicide, whatever form it takes, has always been regarded by the law as a most serious crime. The protection of human life and personal safety is a primary objective of the system of criminal justice. The value which the community places upon human life is reflected in its expectation of that system.” 
        
       
      
    32 However, because it is an offence which involves a wide variety of circumstances, it is difficult to obtain much by way of assistance from reference to the Judicial Commission statistics or from other cases. R v Schelberger (Court of Criminal Appeal, Yeldham J, 2 July 1988, unreported), R v Elliott (Court of Criminal Appeal, Newman J, 14 February 1991, unreported), R v Blacklidge (Court of Criminal Appeal, Gleeson CJ, 12 December 1995, unreported), R v Isaacs (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 381, R v Green [1999] NSWCCA 97, Woodland, supra, Hoerler, supra.  
     
      
    33 It is an offence where the appropriate penalties vary perhaps more than for any other serious crime contained within the criminal calendar. Elliot, supra.  
     
      
    34 In R v Warren Alan Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377; (2005) 160 A Crim R 1, Spigelman CJ (McClellan CJ at CL agreeing) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[133] As has frequently been stated, manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence. (See in particular the observations of Gleeson CJ in  
        R v Blacklidge 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, esp pp2-3.) In its objective gravity it may vary, as has been pointed out, from a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder ( 
        R v Weinman 
         (1987) 49 SASR 248 at 252;  
        R v Hoerler  
        [2004] NSWCCA 184; 
          
        (2004) 147 A Crim R 520 at [39]).  
        
       
       
       
        
        [134] It is also relevant to recognise that, although manslaughters can be characterised in different ways, particularly in the various contexts which may reduce what would otherwise be a murder to manslaughter, the degree of variation  
        within  
        any such category is generally also over a wide range. Matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter. 
        
       
       
       
        
        [135] For example where diminished responsibility is relied upon, the extent to which culpability is ‘diminished’ can vary considerably from case to case. Similarly, although it is possible to characterise a number of cases as ‘child-killing by a parent or carer’, it may never be possible to identify a sentencing pattern or tariff from the whole body of such cases. (See  
        Hoerler 
         supra.) This is not only because the number of cases in a particular category may be too few to establish a pattern or tariff. It is also because, within any such category, the relevant circumstances can vary over a wide range. This is also true in the case of manslaughter by reason of excessive self-defence (see  
        R v Trevenna  
        [2004] NSWCCA 43; 
          
        (2003) 149 A Crim R 505).” 
        
       
      
    35 As the Court of Criminal Appeal has said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The crime of manslaughter comprehends all forms of punishable homicide other than murder ( 
        Crimes Act  
        1900 
        ,  
        s 18 
        ). 
         For presently relevant purposes, the crime of murder is taken to have been committed where the act of the accused, causing death, was done with intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, or with reckless indifference to human life. Some forms of manslaughter, … involve conduct which would amount to murder, except for the presence of some recognised mitigating circumstance. Other forms of manslaughter, sometimes referred to as ‘involuntary’, do not involve an intent to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, or reckless indifference to human life. They may, for example, involve causing death by an unlawful and dangerous act.  
        
       
       
       
        
        It has long been recognised that the circumstances which may give rise to a conviction for manslaughter are so various, and the range of degrees of culpability is so wide, that it is not possible to point to any established sentencing tariff which can be applied to such cases. Of all crimes, manslaughter throws up the greatest variety of circumstances affecting culpability.  
         
         
        At the same time, the courts have repeatedly stressed that what is involved in every case of manslaughter is the felonious taking of a human life. That is the starting point for a consideration of the appropriate penalty, and a key element in the assessment of the gravity of the objective circumstances of the case. ( 
        R v Dodd  
        (1991) 57 A Crim R 349;  
        R v Hill  
        (1981) 3 A Crim R 397 at 402.)” ( 
        R v Blacklidge  
        (Court of Criminal Appeal, Gleeson CJ, 12 December 1995, unreported.) 
        
       
      
    Objective Circumstances 
     
      
    36 As can be seen from the foregoing, EA was born congenitally ill and remained so. He remained as ill as he was, because his parents did not seek medical attention.  
     
      
    37 The failure, or, more accurately, refusal, to seek medical attention for their son derived from the faith that JA and HA had in the healing power of God.  
     
      
    38 JA, the father, was a Minister at the Free Wesleyan Church at Minto, and had been since 2001. It is not a generally held belief of that Church or denomination that medical attention would not be sought, or that reliance would be placed on God to heal the sick, to the exclusion of medical attention.  
     
      
    39 It was, however, a strongly held view of JA, and a view that HA had, at the time, adopted from her husband.  
     
      
    40 As is made clear in the evidence before the Court, JA was a totally dominating personality within the household and HA was significantly, if not totally, under his control.  
     
      
    41 Manslaughter encompasses the greatest range of criminal culpability ranging from circumstances very close to murder to wholly unintended results of otherwise relatively minor crimes (e.g. a single punch, provoked, where the victim falls awkwardly, and dies). 
     
      
    42 This crime is at the lowest level of criminal culpability associated with manslaughter. It involves no premeditation. It involves no violence. It does involve a breach of trust – possibly the most important trust for which anyone has responsibility – the trust reposed in parents by their child.  
     
      
    43 But even within that kind of relationship, this criminal conduct is at the lowest range. This is not a case in which a parent has generally neglected a child. It is not a case where, either from drug addiction, mental disorder or plain selfishness, a parent has left a child unattended or uncared for. There are no beatings, no dirty nappies, no inappropriate clothing or bedding.  
     
      
    44 When the Police arrived at the scene, on the day of EA’s death, the parents were sitting on the lounge, cradling their dead child.  
     
      
    45 This was a child who was loved and, albeit negligently in one major respect, cared for. The Police noted, while the home was cluttered, it was clean: the floors, the sheets, the kitchen. The victim’s cot was in his parent’s bedroom. The child was, on the evidence before the Court, fed, and he ate as much as his siblings, who are all healthy. His malnutrition, I find as a fact, was due to his congenital disorder, not lack of feeding or lack of ordinary care. 46 Of course, his congenital disorder was treatable and the lack of care was the failure to seek and obtain medical attention for EA.  
     
      
    47 It is difficult, even, for most religious people, who take the view that the intelligence of mankind and, relevantly, medical science is itself a gift from God, to understand the kind of faith that shuns medical attention in favour of the direct intervention of God. Nevertheless, I hold that JA’s faith was genuine – it certainly did not involve any lack of love for his children.  
     
      
    48 I also hold that, during the time her husband was alive, HA’s faith in God to heal her son (and others) was also genuine. In the subjective circumstances, I will deal with the relationship between HA and her husband.  
     
      
    49 In the range of cases that come within the crime of manslaughter, this must be at the lowest end of culpability – tragic though it is for all who are involved, but mostly tragic for a child that, because of the absence of medical treatment, has not only been denied his life, but has been denied a life that could have been useful and productive.  
     
      
    Subjective Circumstances 
     
      
    50 Some of the subjective factors have already been mentioned, and I repeat them only for convenience.  
     
      
    51 The most obvious subjective feature is HA’s family history. On one view, given the nature of this offence, this is relevant to the objective circumstances of the manslaughter. In this case, it is difficult to delineate precisely between the two, but the factors are taken into account once only.  
     
      
    52 I have already described HA’s early childhood and the circumstances that gave rise to the relationship with her husband. I have also described his dominating personality.  
     
      
    53 During their relationship, JA borrowed money from HA’s family and did not repay it. HA was unaware of these factors until JA died. JA cut himself and HA off from her family – not totally, but almost totally.  
     
      
    54 HA’s mother attested to the fact that, notwithstanding their closeness during her teen years, once HA lived with JA, she saw her mother only three to four times per year. HA, her mother said, cut herself off from everybody.  
     
      
    55 Likewise was the relationship with her sisters. While close as young persons, once HA commenced living with JA, they never saw each other. In all cases, it was not a distance that was geographic, but rather it was one of relationship.  
     
      
    56 HA and JA each gave interviews to the Police. There was no attempt to do anything other than disclose all of the facts – including the congenital issues and the lack of medical care. Further, both HA and JA gave consistent evidence of the nature of the relationship between them.  
     
      
    57 The most probable explanation, especially with the benefit of hindsight, is that HA’s love for, and infatuation, with JA, together with her genuine religious beliefs, her lack of strength and maturity, when coupled with JA’s religious fervour, his dominating personality, his maturity and strength, made her wholly dependent on JA for everything. Her separation from her own family made this dependence complete. It was, even within this joint enterprise, JA that was the principal, the decision-maker and the more culpable of the two. He was 20 years her senior, had previously been married (of which HA was unaware) and has other children from that marriage.  
     
      
    58 Since JA’s death, the contrast is astounding. Notwithstanding the circumstances, the level of physical and emotional support for her, from HA’s family, has been remarkable.  
     
      
    59 She has restored her relationship with her mother and her sisters. She sees them or speaks to them daily. Her brother-in-law, who gave evidence, goes to her place to help out on weekends and there are members of her family assisting her almost daily. In the words of her mother: “she is back to her old self” – a reference to their relationship before HA met JA. 
     
      
    60 Each of her children (there are nine) is now healthy and is regularly subjected by HA to medical checks.  
     
      
    61 There is no doubt from the evidence of HA, both its content and her, sometimes tearful, demeanour, that her remorse, and sadness, is unlimited. Her remorse goes beyond the effect (i.e. the death of EA) but also includes her “stupidity” in refusing medical attention or not sufficiently standing up to her husband about this issue.  
     
      
    62 HA does not seem to suffer from psychological or psychiatric disorders or from abnormal personality functioning. She falls into the category of borderline intellectual disability, although, in the witness box, she was impressive, clear and obviously caring for her children. 
     
      
    63 There are no prior convictions and HA, otherwise, has an exemplary character. She is entitled to the leniency, described by the High Court in Veen v R (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465, reserved for first offenders.  
     
      
    Plea and Assistance  
     
      
    64 In accordance with the legislative scheme, s 22 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, HA is entitled to a discount for the plea of guilty. The plea was at an extremely early time and I fix a discount at a high level, just short of the maximum 25%.  
     
      
    65 Further, HA provided, through the interview and otherwise, significant assistance to the police and the investigation process. Because of the congenital disorders and the evidence of no obvious illness beyond those disorders, which illness was the cause of death, this would have been a difficult case for the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt, but for the assistance of HA. I allow a discount for assistance.  
     
      
    66 In all, I allow, for both the plea of guilty and assistance, a total discount of approximately 35%. There are no aggravating circumstances, except the obvious relationship of trust.  
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    67 Ms Manuell, who most ably represented HA, submitted that the appropriate sentence was non-custodial: a 5 year good behaviour bond.  
     
      
    68 The Crown, who most helpfully made submissions on all matters, submitted that such a sentence is not beyond range. The Crown, quite properly, described the circumstances of this case as most unusual and exceptional.  
     
      
    69 The benefit of such a sentence is that it would provide a longer period of supervision than an appropriate custodial sentence, particularly the non-parole period of such a sentence.  
     
      
    70 Somewhat bizarrely, the pre-sentence reports preclude Community Service and Periodic Detention, because of childcare responsibilities. I say bizarrely, because the alternative, full-time custody, would create greater problems. 
     
      
    71 Notwithstanding the exceptional nature of these circumstances, I am not convinced that this felonious taking of human life requires less than a custodial sentence imposed. Society must understand that parents, whatever their beliefs, have a particular trust relationship that must be discharged in a way that ensures the health and welfare of their children.  
     
      
    72 However, the exceptional nature and the confidence of the Court, consistent with all the expert evidence, that there will be no chance of re-offending, affects the manner in which it will be served.  
     
      
    73 The starting point, bearing in mind all objective and subjective factors, is a custodial sentence of 3 years’ imprisonment. I apply the approximate 35% discount for plea and assistance, to derive a sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment.  
     
      
    Conviction and Sentence 
     
      
    74 HA, you are convicted of manslaughter in that, on 29 August 2003, at Minto in the State of New South Wales, you did unlawfully kill EA.  
     
      
    75 I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of 2 years, commencing 18 December 2008 and concluding 17 January 2010.  
     
      
    76 I order that the execution of the aforesaid sentence be wholly suspended for 2 years and HA be released from custody on condition that she enter into a good behaviour bond for 2 years.  
     
      
    77 Such bond shall include the following additional conditions: 
     
      
       
      (i) That HA undergo such counselling as advised by Probation and Parole Service; and 
       
       
      (ii) That HA comply with reasonable directions of officers of the Department of Community Service that may act to ensure that each child of HA is subject to regular medical attention.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
       Introduction 
      
    1 THE COURT: On 20 August 2007 the appellant was arraigned before a jury on an indictment containing four counts. The first count alleged that on 2 August 2006 the appellant maliciously wounded [the complainant] with intent to do grievous bodily harm. This was an offence contrary to s 33 of the Crimes Act 1900. The appellant pleaded not guilty to that charge. The complainant was the appellant’s wife. The three other counts on the indictment each alleged that on 2 April 2006 the appellant took a child with intent to remove the child from the lawful control of [the complainant], she being the person having parental responsibility for the child, without her consent. Each charge related to one of the three children of the appellant’s marriage to the complainant and alleged a breach of s 87(1) of the Crimes Act. The appellant pleaded guilty to each of these charges. 
     
      
    2 The trial proceeded on the first count. On 27 August 2007 the jury found the appellant not guilty of the offence under s 33 but convicted him of an alternative offence of malicious wounding contrary to s 35 of the Crimes Act. As a consequence on 9 November 2007 Judge Goldring (the Judge) sentenced the appellant to an overall sentence of 6 years 6 months from 1 June 2007 with an overall non-parole period of 4 years 6 months. 
     
      
    3 The appellant appeals against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against sentence. The grounds of appeal in respect of the conviction are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Ground 1: The trial miscarried due to the admission of evidence: 
         
         
         (a) concerning the conduct of the appellant toward the complainant on 16 July 2006; 
         
         
         (b) of the making of an Apprehended Domestic Violence Order at Kogarah Local Court on 20 July 2006. 
         
         
        Ground 2: The learned trial Judge erred in failing to adequately direct the jury as to the use of the evidence concerning the events on 6 July 2006 and the making of ADVO on 20 July 2006. 
        
       
       
      The facts 
      
    4 The evidence at the trial can be very briefly stated. The appellant and the complainant had separated on 16 July 2006. On that date there had been an argument between them after the appellant forced his wife to allow him to read her e-mails. There was a discussion about a person named Jimmy who had been the subject of one or more of the e-mails. The complainant alleged that the appellant said, “I now understand all these people that you hear about that kill their wives and kids because that’s how you make me feel”. The complainant rang the police. She alleged that a short time later the appellant said, “I swear to God I’m going to take the kids and I’m going to do something stupid”. The complainant then rang the police a second time. She heard the appellant say to the children that they should get ready to go to the holiday house in Canberra. The family used to stay at a particular motel to which they referred as the “holiday house”. The police attended and advised the complainant to leave. She saw the police trying to remove the appellant from the house and he was fighting with them. 
     
      
    5 The complainant went with the police and an interim Apprehended Domestic Violence Order (ADVO) was taken out. The police then took her and the children to a refuge. On 20 July 2006 an ADVO order was made against the appellant by a magistrate at Kogarah Local Court. The appellant agreed to the making of that order without any admissions. A condition of the order was that the appellant not contact the complainant or the children directly. 
     
      
    6 On 23 July 2006 the appellant was given access to his children. This was arranged through the complainant’s parents. The complainant required that the appellant sign a document before he could see the children. He agreed to this and saw his children under the parents’ supervision. 
     
      
    7 On 2 August 2006 the complainant received a text message from the appellant that had been forwarded to her by her father. The message asked the father to arrange for the complainant to call him urgently. The complainant rang the appellant from a new mobile phone for which the appellant did not have the number. The appellant said, “I just want to talk to you, I just want to see you”. At first she declined to meet him but the appellant said that he had presents for the children. She agreed to meet him at the church where he had been given access to the children on the previous occasion. 
     
      
    8 The complainant went with the children to the church and met with the appellant. He gave the children the gifts he had for them. The appellant asked whether there was somewhere they could take the children to play. She and the children entered into the appellant’s vehicle and she directed him to a park. She told the jury that there was a playground near the refuge but she did want him to go there. After the appellant parked the car, the appellant and the complainant got out and spoke together about their relationship while one of the children played in the park. He asked whether there was any chance of them getting back together and she said, “No”. He suggested they take the children to McDonalds. They put the child into the car with the other two children. He told them to wait there because he wanted to talk to their mother. 
     
      
    9 According to the complainant the appellant placed his hand on her shoulder and led her to the back of the park. She thought he was going to hug or kiss her. He looked at the building behind her and, as the complainant turned around, she felt him take her mobile phone from her pocket. As she turned back toward him, he struck her to the face with the mobile phone in his hand. He then threw the phone away and struck her four more times to the head. She fell to the ground and she saw him with a knife moving toward her. She turned and the knife struck her in the shoulder. The appellant kept lashing at her with the knife and she started screaming. He then stood up, threw the knife away and ran toward the vehicle. She recovered her phone and ran after him trying to ring 000. The appellant drove off with the children. She fell to the ground screaming. A number of persons came to her assistance and she complained that she had been stabbed and that the appellant had taken her children. 
     
      
    10 The appellant gave a different account of the incident at the park. He gave evidence that the complainant had produced the knife. His version was that, when they reached the park, the three children got out to play. He and the complainant spoke together and she showed him her new phone. They then decided that it was time to go to McDonalds. He placed the three children into the vehicle while the complainant walked around the park with the phone in her hand. She called him over and he joined her. She took his hand and walked with him to the back of the park. 
     
      
    11 The complainant said to him, “This is the last time you are ever going to see your kids”. He was shaking and could not believe what she said. He saw the complainant holding a knife in her right hand with a tissue or handkerchief around it. She was waving it in circles in front of his face. She said, “Why don’t you go kill yourself, make it easier on every one?” He tried to flick the knife away but unbeknownst to him he cut himself on the blade. He lunged onto the complainant and she fell to the ground, landing on her back. He was able to wrestle the knife from her and threw it away. He then got up and ran to the car. The complainant was not screaming at that time. He was unaware that she had been stabbed. 
     
      
    12 The appellant took the children and went to Canberra. He eventually found a hotel that could take him and the children but it was not the “holiday home”. The next morning he saw a story about himself on the television. He rang 000 and spoke to an operator. He told her the name of the hotel. He then received a call from a police officer and he agreed to surrender to the police He was later arrested and extradited to this State. The appellant was legally represented at the police station where he was to be interviewed and in consultation with his lawyer produced a six-page statement giving his version. 
     
      
    13 At the trial the appellant gave evidence and called witnesses as to his good character. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1  
      
    14 It is contended that the evidence of the events on 16 July 2006 and the making of the ADVO order that have been outlined above should not have been admitted. Counsel for the appellant conceded that there was no objection and, therefore, r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applies. In effect the appellant has to show that the introduction of the evidence resulted in a miscarriage of justice. During the course of the hearing and late in the address by counsel for the appellant, leave was sought to amend the grounds of appeal to add a ground that trial counsel was incompetent in not objecting to the evidence about which complaint is now made. The Court refused leave. The appellant had ample time to amend the grounds of appeal prior to the hearing. But more importantly the Court would not be prepared to consider such a ground of appeal without allowing trial counsel the opportunity of commenting upon the manner in which the trial was conducted. Yet nothing had been done by the appellant to obtain an affidavit of trial counsel to explain why he did not object to the evidence. This has been a not uncommon practice in this Court where r 4 arises notwithstanding what was said in R v Moussa [2001] NSWCCA 427 about that practice.  
     
      
    15 In these circumstances, before it could be said that a miscarriage of justice had been occasioned by the reception of the evidence, it would have to be very clearly shown to this Court that there was no possible tactical advantage to the defence in having the evidence before the jury and yet it presented a very clear and overwhelming prejudice to the appellant. 
     
      
       
        
        The decision in Steve v R 
        
       
      
    16 Because no objection was taken to the evidence, there was no occasion for the trial judge to consider the probative value of it or the danger of unfair prejudice arising from it; cf s 137 of the Evidence Act. Yet the appellant argues that the evidence to which the ground relates was either inadmissible or unfairly prejudicial such that it should never have been before the jury. Having regard to the issue raised in this appeal the Court brought to the attention of the parties, before the hearing, the decision in Steve v R [2008] NSWCCA 231 so that they could consider it and if necessary rely upon that decision or seek to distinguish it. The appellant embraced the decision. The Crown submitted that the decision should not be followed with regard to the interpretation of s 137 favoured by that Court. 
     
      
    17 In Steve this Court held that s 137 was mandatory so that a trial judge has an obligation to reject evidence where its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice notwithstanding that no objection had been taken to it during the course of the trial, see per Beazley JA at [60], quoting from Heydon JA in R v Le [2002] NSWCCA 186; (2002) 130 A Crim R 44, at 47, and at [82]. 
     
      
    18 It should be noted that there is no reference to r 4 in the judgment of Beazley JA notwithstanding that no objection was taken to any of the evidence that was the subject of the grounds of appeal. It may be the case that the Crown did not rely upon r 4 as there is no reference to it in the summary of the Crown arguments contained in the judgment of her Honour. Beazley JA concluded at [87] that “the Court cannot be satisfied that no substantial miscarriage of justice has occurred”. But had r 4 been invoked, the appellant would have had to satisfy the Court that there had been a miscarriage of justice notwithstanding the failure of defence counsel to take any objection to the evidence: Papakosmas v The Queen (1999) 196 CLR 297 per McHugh J at 319; R v Moussa above at [63]; R v Villa [2005] NSWCCA 4 at [77]. 
     
      
    19 Nor is there any reference in the reasoning of the Court to the decision of this Court in R v Reid [1990] NSWCCA 258 or the decision of the High Court in Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40; 217 CLR 1. It is apparent that the Court’s attention was not brought to either of these important decisions that deal with the interpretation of evidentiary provisions in legislation in this State. We note that there is no reference to Reid in the judgment of Heydon J in Le and Dhanhoa was a judgment delivered after Le was decided 
     
      
    20 Reid was a case concerned with the application of what was then s 424A(2) of the Crimes Act (now s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act) dealing with the admissibility of admissions by suspected persons. At trial no objection had been taken to the evidence of the admissions made by the appellant notwithstanding that the procedures set out in s 424A had not been complied with. On appeal it was argued that the section operated to exclude the evidence even though objection had not been taken at trial. In dismissing that argument Spigelman CJ stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [3]  
        The legislative history and significance of s424A of the Crimes Act is set out by Wood CJ at CL in R v Horton (1998) 45 NSWLR 426. The section was cognate with, and commenced operation at the same time as, the new Evidence Act (NSW) 1995. S424A represents an important public policy, which this Court will enforce. 
         
         
        [4]  
        The operative words in s424A(2) are ""Evidence of an admission is not admissible unless ..."". The submission was made that this provision operated in accordance with its literal meaning, and accordingly, should be given effect even though no objection to the admission of the evidence was taken on behalf of the accused at the trial. 
         
         
        [5]  
        The Parliament was well aware, particularly in the context of legislation cognate with the general amendments to the scheme of evidence contained in the Evidence Act 1995, that the usual course of proceedings in trials under the adversary system requires objection to be taken to evidence. The words ""is not admissible"" should be construed as meaning ""is not admissible over objection"". The usual practice in the course of trials was part of the total context in which Parliament used these words and the narrow literal interpretation propounded on behalf of the Appellant is not appropriate. 
        
       
       
      Greg James J agreed with the judgment of the Chief Justice. 
       
      
    21 This interpretation of the words of that provision has been applied on a number of occasions by this Court to later re-enactments of the provision in its various guises. The most recent was in Gonzales v R [2007] NSWCCA 321; 178 A Crim R 232. 
     
      
    22 In R v Lyberopoulos [2002] NSWCCA 280 the Court was concerned with the provision as it then appeared in s 108 of the Criminal Procedure Act. In that case a police officer, Constable White, gave evidence of a conversation he allegedly had with the appellant near a motor vehicle and of the conduct of the appellant in relation to a bag in which drugs had been found. At his trial the appellant gave evidence denying the evidence of Constable White. Hulme J, with the concurrence of Mason P and Simpson J stated (our underlining),  
     
      
       
        
         
        [40]  
        The statements were made in the course of official questioning and the offence was of a type which fell within para(c) of subs1 and thus the statements were, within the terms of s108 not admissible. 
         
         
        [41]  
        However, no objection was taken to the evidence. It is trite law that statutory provisions to the effect that evidence is not admissible normally mean ""not admissible over objection"" and that interpretation has been given to the predecessor of s108, then s424A of the Crimes Act - R v Reid [1999] NSWCCA 258 See also R v Spathis; R v Patsalis [2001] NSWCCA 476 at [416-417] 
         
         
        [42]  
        Reliance was also placed on s90, s135 and s137 of the Evidence Act. The first 2 of these sections confer a discretion on the court and the reasons that inspired the Court in R v Reid to construe the expression ""not admissible"" as it did, mean that no error occurred when the evidence was given without objection. 
         
         
        [43]  
        S137 is cast in somewhat different terms, providing as it does that:- 
         
          
          ""In a criminal proceeding, the court must refuse to admit evidence adduced by the prosecutor if its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant."" 
          
         
         
        [44]  
        It is clear that the evidence of Constable White as to both the statements of the Appellant and his actions in grabbing the black sports bag and in unlocking it, had at least if Constable White was believed, substantial probative value. And while there were arguments against the acceptance of his evidence and it was contradicted in part by the evidence of the Appellant, there is no particular reason to think that he would not be believed. There was no significant attack otherwise on his credibility. 
         
         
        [45]  
        And I am unable to see any ""danger of unfair prejudice"". Whatever the meaning or operation of the phrase, it could not include the jury's belief in Constable White nor, at least in the absence of some unusual circumstances - and there were none - the possibility that the jury might believe him.  
        Neither can there be unfairness or the danger of unfairness in the admission of evidence obtained when the procedures envisaged by s108 of the Criminal Procedure Act were not being followed, when the opportunity exists, but is not taken, to object to that evidence 
        . 
         
        
       
      
    23 Another, apparently, mandatory provision dealing with a trial judge’s obligations in relation to evidence was considered in Dhanhoa. In this case the High Court was concerned with the interpretation of s 116 of the Evidence Act. That section literally requires a trial judge to give certain information set out in the section whenever “identification evidence”, as defined in the Act, is admitted. 
     
      
    24 After setting out the relevant statutory provisions, Gleeson CJ and Hayne J in a joint judgment stated (footnotes have not been reproduced): 
     
      
       
        
         
        [18]  
        Although counsel for both parties to the present appeal began by accepting that the provisions of s116 are ""mandatory"", upon further consideration they acknowledged that, in a context such as the present, such a description may be question-begging. It is the content of the mandate that must be decided. 
         
         
        [19]  
        If read literally, and apart from its statutory context, s116 could be taken to mean that a judge is always required to inform the jury that there is a special need for caution before accepting identification evidence whenever identification evidence has been admitted, even if the reliability of the evidence is not in dispute. That would be absurd. If a witness claims to have seen an accused at a particular place on a particular occasion, and the truth of that assertion is not questioned or in any way put in issue, then ordinarily there is no special need for caution before accepting the evidence. The common law principle, expressed in the passage from Domican quoted above, contains the obvious qualification that the warning is to be given where the reliability of the evidence of identification is disputed. The same qualification is implied in s116; if it were otherwise the provision would offend common sense. 
         
         
        [20]  
        S114 and s115, like many other provisions of the Evidence Act, declare that evidence of a certain kind is not admissible in certain circumstances, or unless certain conditions are fulfilled. Yet evidence of a kind to which those sections refer may not be the subject of objection. Counsel for an accused person may have any one of a number of reasons for not objecting. A trial judge ordinarily will not know why no objection is taken, and may have no right to enquire. Counsel might decide not to object simply because he or she knows that that accused, upon giving evidence, will admit that the identification evidence is correct. The Evidence Act applies in an adversarial context. It is the parties, and their counsel, who define the issues at trial, select the witnesses, and choose the evidence that they will lead, and to which they will take objection. It is the duty of the prosecution, in its case, to lead the whole of the evidence to which the accused is required to make answer. It will often appear, in the course of a defence case, that some, perhaps much, of that evidence is not in dispute. In that event, it will be appropriate for a judge to point that out to the jury. 
         
         
        [21]  
        Reference was made in Festa v The Queen to in-court acts of identification. They provide a well known example of potentially unreliable identifications. Yet such identifications are often received into evidence, without objection, simply because they are not in dispute. When that occurs, it is only in the most technical sense that there is any question of ""accepting"" the evidence. 
         
         
        [22]  
        To give s116 a literal meaning would produce a consequence that is wholly unreasonable. The statutory requirement to give the jury certain information is to be understood in the light of the adversarial context in which the legislation operates, and the nature of the information the subject of the requirement. So understood, the provision means that the information referred to is to be given where the reliability of the identification evidence is disputed. 
         
        
       
      
    25 In the joint judgment of McHugh and Gummow JJ the following is stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [53]  
        The obligation imposed by s116 must be read in the context of the adversarial system of criminal justice. It is not to be supposed that, in enacting that section, the legislature intended that juries be given directions concerning identification evidence when identification was not an issue. It is not to be supposed that the legislature intended a trial judge to give a direction that was not relevant to the issues in the case. Not only would it be a waste of curial time and effort but the giving of an irrelevant direction would be likely to confuse the jury who understandably would be puzzled as to what significance the direction had. 
         
        
       
       
      Callinan J was also of the view at [91] that s 116 could not be given a “universally mandatory construction”. 
       
      
    26 We note by way of contrast the provision presently contained in s 275A of the Criminal Procedure Act in relation to improper questions. Section 275A(1) states that a court in criminal proceedings “must disallow a question put to a witness in cross-examination or inform the witness that it need not be answered” if the court is of the opinion that the question is of a particular nature as set out in the subsection. Section 275A(4) permits a party to object to such a question. But s 275A(5) states: 
     
      
       
        
         
        However, the duty imposed upon the court by this section applies whether or not an objection is raised to a particular question. 
        
       
      
    27 This is a clear indication, if any be needed, that Parliament understood that courts would not generally be under an obligation to reject a question to which no objection was taken and did not intend generally that other obligations imposed upon a trial judge in relation to the admission or reception of evidence would apply except where an objection is taken to the evidence. Section 275A can be compared with s 41 of the Evidence Act, which does not apply to criminal proceedings, that permits a court to disallow an improper question but does not purport to impose a duty on a court to do so irrespective of whether objection is taken to the question. 
     
      
    28 With respect, we find the argument contained in paragraph 20 in the judgment of Dhanhoa set out above compelling in rejecting the notion that, generally speaking, a trial judge should take upon himself or herself the role of determining the admissibility or reception of evidence to which no objection is taken by a lawyer representing an accused person. There may be provisions that unambiguously impose such an obligation on a court by the wording of the section, for example s 275A, or by reason of its subject matter; for example provisions concerned with the exclusion of evidence in the public interest such as s 130. But we do not believe that s 137 falls into either of those categories and therefore, imposes an obligation on a trial judge to reject evidence of his or her own motion where no objection is taken and the accused is legally represented. There may be exceptional situations where a trial judge is compelled to intervene in order to prevent a miscarriage of justice, but there is in our opinion no provision of the Evidence Act that requires such intervention. 
     
      
    29 So far as s 137 is concerned, we do not understand how a trial judge could reliably undertake the balancing exercise that the section requires between the probative value of the evidence and the danger of unfair prejudice without a complete understanding of both the Crown and defence cases and the arguments to be addressed to the jury by the parties. Yet the section is engaged when the Crown first introduces the evidence that is later impugned in this Court. This difficulty is alone sufficient to lead us to the conclusion that s 137 cannot operate to oblige a judge to reject evidence that may later be seen in the context of the whole of the trial to have resulted in a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    30 Strictly speaking it was unnecessary for the Court in Steve to determine the issues raised by construing s 137 as it did. However, nothing we have written is to be taken as suggesting that the decision was in any way erroneous in finding that the trial miscarried by the reception of the evidence in the circumstances of that particular case. Nor does it necessary follow that a miscarriage of justice would not have been found had r 4 been applied. However, we respectfully disagree with the finding that the miscarriage of justice arose from the failure of the trial judge of his own motion to reject evidence to which no objection had been taken by the solicitor for the defence. 
     
      
       
        
        Did a miscarriage arise in the present case? 
        
       
      
    31 The present appeal can be determined on the basis that r 4 applies and, therefore, the onus is upon the appellant to show to the Court how, in the absence of objection from an apparently competent defence counsel, the admission of the evidence as to what happened on 16 July or the making of the ADVO led to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    32 It should be noted that the defence put forward by the appellant was not without some difficulties for defence counsel. According to the appellant it was the complainant who brought the knife to the park and threatened him with it. Yet it was the complainant who ended up with a not insignificant stab wound to the shoulder as well as some other minor injuries. Rather than complain to the police about the complainant’s behaviour, the appellant took the children to Canberra. The common experience of the jury might, at least to a prima facie view, lead them to believe that the person who produces a knife is not likely to be the person who is injured by it. Particularly, where as here, the appellant was saying that the complainant in effect managed to wound herself. The evidence of the treating surgeon was that it was unlikely to have been self-inflicted. 
     
      
    33 The appellant stated that the Crown case depended upon the evidence of the complainant and that the jury were directed that they needed to be satisfied of the complainant’s evidence beyond reasonable doubt. However, there was some support for the complainant’s account in the evidence of the persons who came upon the scene and the complainant’s statement to them that her husband had stabbed her. This was evidence admissible under s 66 of the Evidence Act as hearsay evidence and was available to the jury as evidence of the truth of what the complainant asserted. In our opinion the jury would clearly have recognised the probative value of that evidence, even though there was no direction to this effect given by the trial judge. There was also a Triple 0 call made by the complainant shortly after the incident that the Crown sought to use to support the truthfulness of her account. This material would not have made defence counsel’s task any easier in seeking to raise with the jury the reasonable possibility that the complainant produced the knife and wounded herself. 
     
      
    34 The submission on behalf of the appellant is that the combined evidence of the incident occurring on 16 July and the making of the ADVO presented the jury with evidence of a court order restraining the appellant from violent conduct toward the complainant. The argument is that this evidence “negated the impact of the evidence of good character” led by the appellant and it supported the complainant’s account of the incident of 2 August by suggesting that the appellant had “a propensity to behave in a violent or threatening manner to the complainant”. 
     
      
    35 The submission was made that the evidence of the incident on 16 July and the making of the ADVO was irrelevant to any issue before the jury especially in light of the fact that the appellant had pleaded guilty to the offences in relation to his abduction of the children. It was further submitted that the evidence of what occurred on 16 July was “akin to evidence of uncharged criminal conduct” and hence gave rise to the concerns expressed by members of the High Court in HML v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; 82 ALJR 723. It was argued that the ADVO gave “explicit support to the uncharged conduct and the account of the complainant”. 
     
      
    36 In our opinion the evidence of what occurred on 16 July and the making of the ADVO was clearly relevant to what occurred thereafter including the incident on 2 August. It was an example of background or context evidence that explained why the parties did what they did and said what they did both before and on the 2 August. It set the scene for the incident that gave rise to the charges. For example, the evidence explained why the appellant could not have direct contact with the complainant or the children and the arrangements that had to be made for his access to the children through the complainant’s parents.  
     
      
    37 It is the type of evidence that was recognised at common law in a series of cases including O’Leary v The King (1946) 73 CLR 566; Wilson v The Queen (1970) 123 CLR 334 and Harriman v The Queen (1989) 167 CLR 590. Such evidence has been admitted as evidence either of the relationship between the accused and some other person or of a connected series of events such that what occurred at one particular point in time in that relationship or in that series of events was relevant to a determination of what occurred at another point in time when the offence was committed. This type of evidence continues to be admissible under the Evidence Act: R v Quach [2002] NSWCCA 519. 
     
      
    38 The kind of evidence considered in HML, that is evidence of allegations of uncharged sexual activity between the complainant and the accused, is derived from this type of evidence but has its own peculiarities such that it has been treated with considerable circumspection by the courts. This is because its potential to prejudice the accused is extremely high and because of the difficulty in circumscribing the use to be made of the evidence to avoid it being used improperly as propensity evidence when it is not tendered for that purpose. It is the grave potential for prejudice arising from that kind of evidence that has resulted in special rules being adopted by some members of the High Court for the introduction and use of that evidence. For example it appears now to be the law that, if that type of evidence is to be used by the jury for tendency reasoning, it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt; see DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272. There has been no suggestion that any other type of propensity evidence has to be proved to that standard. 
     
      
    39 However the category of evidence into which the events of 16 July and the making of the ADVO fall has never been considered as propensity evidence even though it is admitted to explain the conduct giving rise to the criminal charges by reference to conduct on another occasion. Nor has it ever been seen to carry with it the type of prejudice that has accompanied the introduction of uncharged sexual activity in child sexual assault cases. In the present case, unlike evidence of the type considered in HML, there can be no concern that the jury could reasonably have used the evidence for propensity reasoning. The Crown in opening described it as “background”. It was never elevated to anything more than that either in addresses or in the summing up. 
     
      
    40 However, the incident on 16 July was also clearly relevant to the major issue before the jury: who of the appellant or the complainant might have brought a knife to a meeting between them in the context of the ongoing matrimonial disharmony? If the jury accepted the complainant’s account of the incident on 16 July, the statement attributed to the appellant about men feeling like killing their wives and children was obviously of significance in this regard. The only prejudicial aspect of the evidence was that it was probative of the prosecution case that the appellant produced the knife. It was evidence as to the appellant’s state of mind arising from his marital problems at a time relatively proximate to the incident the subject of the trial. 
     
      
    41 Had the appellant’s wife been found stabbed to death and the question of who was responsible had been the issue before a jury, it would clearly be relevant that a short time before the killing the appellant was expressing the thought that her conduct was capable of provoking a man to kill his wife and family. So too in the present trial it was relevant in the determination of the prosecution allegation that the appellant stabbed the complainant even though ultimately the jury found that he did not intend to inflict grievous bodily harm. But, although relevant, it was not propensity evidence. It was simply evidence of the appellant’s reaction to his marital problems that were continuing up until the time of the incident giving rise to the charges. 
     
      
    42 In this regard we do not believe that the making of the ADVO order impermissibly or unfairly bolstered the credibility of the complainant’s account of the incident on 16 July, especially when the jury was made aware that the appellant had consented to the order “without making any admissions”. That phrase was used a number of times during the course of the trial. In opening the Crown said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [The appellant] did not oppose the making of that order and, indeed, made no admissions in respect to the alleged conduct that the Crown says took place on 16 July, last year. 
        
       
      
    43 In opening the case for the appellant, defence counsel said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Our case is quite simply that he consented to an AVO on 20 July, that’s about two weeks before the event………. 
        
       
       
      He also referred to the incident of 16 July and said: 
       
       
        
        There was no threat made by [the appellant] against the children, and we would ask you ultimately to infer that it was a pretext to get her out of the house, get the children out of the house and begin an independent life away from [the appellant]. 
        
       
      
    44 The complainant in evidence explained to the jury how the ADVO came to be made, and the negotiations involved in relation to whether the children should be the subject of the order, and whether she would get access to the family vehicle. It was clear from her account that the order had been the result of an agreement reached between the appellant and the complainant. 
     
      
    45 The statement made by the appellant in consultation with his lawyers and read aloud in the recorded interview commenced: 
     
      
       
        
         
        An AVO by consent without admissions was granted on 20th of July 2006. 
        
       
      
    46 The appellant gave evidence about the making of the ADVO and he also told the jury about the negotiations between him and the complainant carried out by lawyers at the courthouse. He accepted that his lawyer told him that he could have a hearing and contest the application but he was advised to agree to it. There was a series of questions about what he understood that agreeing to the order “without making admissions” meant. The appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ….[his lawyer] tried to explain it to me saying you are agreeing [to] it but you’re not, you’re agreeing to the AVO but you’re not agreeing to doing what she said, so I understood that and it seemed like the right thing to do at the time so we just made it easy for everyone. 
        
       
       
      His counsel confirmed with him that he in agreeing to the ADVO was not agreeing with the complainant’s allegations and that the ADVO was made with consent. The appellant commented, “yeah straight away, five minutes and out”. 
       
      
    47 We have no doubt that the jury would have understood that the ADVO was in effect an arrangement made between the complainant and the appellant without any decision being made by the court about what happened on 16 July. The making of the ADVO was incapable of having any effect upon the jury‘s assessment of the credibility of the complainant. 
     
      
    48 For evidence to be rendered inadmissible under s 137, there must be a real risk of the evidence operating unfairly against the accused: R v GK [2001] NSWCCA 413; 53 NSWLR 317. We are unable to see any risk of the jury misusing the evidence of the events of 16 July or the making of the ADVO. 
     
      
    49 Nor do we see how the reception of that evidence improperly affected the jury’s evaluation of the appellant’s good character. His character was never in issue. But the evidence as to the incidents of 16 July was admissible regardless of what implications it carried for the accused’s character. 
     
      
    50 But even if the arguments now mounted against the reception of this evidence had any merit, it would not follow that there has been a miscarriage of justice. The appellant has to confront the fact that no objection was taken to the evidence yet there can be no real suggestion that defence counsel was otherwise incompetent in the manner in which he defended the appellant. It is clear from his address to the jury, that defence counsel used the evidence to what he saw was the appellant’s advantage. This was not a case of defence counsel having to make the best of evidence that was admitted over objection. 
     
      
    51 In effect defence counsel, in the latter part of his address to the jury, sought to portray the complainant as a person controlling the appellant through the use of the incident on 16 July (although counsel refers to 15 July) and the ADVO. He was attempting to persuade the jury that the events of 16 July was not as serious as the complainant made out but that she used that incident and the appellant’s agreement to the resulting ADVO to manipulate him and his access to the children. 
     
      
    52 Part of what he said is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………All that matters at the end of the day between these two people are their children and arrangements as to how they’re going to be cared for and who’s going to see them. That’s what you might think is the real issue. Who is controlling that? [The complainant]. How does he see his kids? She gives him written consent, she picks the time, she picks the location, she picks the day, she picks the circumstances. He agreed to all of that in the AVO. You might think there is something funny about the AVO and the events of 15th. 
        
       
      
    53 Defence counsel then went on to remind the jury of evidence of the complainant’s father that he did not think that the incident on 16 July was “a marriage busting event”. He submitted to the jury that the appellant did not think very much happened on that date except that he was “bundled out of his house and his wife apparently relocated immediately”. He continued in this vein through the events leading up to the incident in the park. He told the jury that the appellant was “exposed to her whim” in relation to his desire to see the children. He used this to attack the credibility of the complainant and to support his client’s version of events. 
     
      
    54 We are satisfied that the first ground of appeal is without merit. Counsel’s decision not to object to the evidence of the incident of 16 July and the ADVO was not wrong but in any event fell well within his discretion to conduct the defence as he saw fit and did not deprive the appellant of a chance of an acquittal: see Seymour v R [2006] NSWCCA 206; 162 A Crim R 576 at [20] to [21]. 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 2 
        
       
      
    55 The second ground contends that the trial judge failed to adequately direct the jury in relation to the evidence of the incident on 16 July and the ADVO. Again the appellant is faced with the difficulty that defence counsel asked for no further directions. 
     
      
    56 The simple point argued is that the trial judge should have directed the jury that the incident of 16 July and the making of the ADVO could not be used in the assessment of the veracity of the complainant. The simple answer is that there was no reason for the trial judge to give such a direction. 
     
      
    57 It was for the jury to determine whether to accept the evidence of the complainant in her account of what occurred on 16 July. If they did then, as we have noted, the evidence of what the accused said supported the complainant’s account of what happened on 2 August and who produced the knife. If they did not believe the complainant’s account of 16 July or they were unable to form any view about it, then it would not have assisted them in determining whether she was telling the truth about what she said was an attack upon her. This is a matter of common sense and well within the jury’s understanding of how to use the evidence of 16 July without being instructed about it by the Judge. 
     
      
    58 In the context of the evidence about the making of the ADVO we find it impossible to see how the jury would have used the evidence to support the complainant’s account. As we have already noted in dealing with ground 1, the jury could have had no misunderstanding as to how the ADVO came to be made and that it said absolutely nothing about whether the complainant’s account of the incident on 16 July was true or not. 
     
      
    59 It is further argued that the trial judge should have directed the jury against propensity reasoning. The appellant relied upon the directions required when evidence of other sexual acts has been introduced in child sexual assault cases as context evidence warning the jury against using the evidence for tendency reasoning. As we have already noted, that type of evidence has a very strong potency to be prejudicial to the accused and this is why the courts have been so astute to ensure that it is received only in appropriate cases and that the jury are directed as to the limitations of its use. The evidence in this case did not have the same potency to prejudice. In any event there was in our view no real likelihood of the jury using tendency reasoning to conclude that it was the appellant who took the knife to the meeting. 
     
      
    60 The trial judge could have said more about the relevance of the evidence of the incident on 16 July but it would not have been to the appellant’s advantage because the Crown were not relying upon the evidence as proof of the appellant’s state of mind as it might have done. The Crown had described it as “background” and the evidence was not otherwise relied upon to prove that it was the accused who brought the knife to the park.  
     
      
    61 The second ground has no merit and, therefore, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
        
        Sentence 
        
       
      
    62 As we have already noted the appellant was sentenced to an overall term of imprisonment of 6 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 4 years 4 months. That overall sentence was made up as follows: on each of the offences of taking a child contrary to s 87(1), a non-parole period of 2 years with a balance of term of 1 year 3 months commencing 1 June 2007, and on the offence of malicious wounding, a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 1 December 2008 with a balance of term of 2 years. The appellant is eligible to be released to parole on 30 November 2011. There was also a related matter under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act for a breach of an apprehended violence order for which the appellant was sentenced to a fixed term of 12 months to date from 1 June 2007 and expiring on 31 May 2008. 
     
      
    63 There is only one ground of appeal being that the sentences imposed are manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    64 The appellant was born on 28 August 1976 in Australia of Italian parents. He had no prior convictions. There was little in his background of relevance and he has close relationships with his father, his mother having died in 1996, and his elder siblings. He has been employed mainly as a truck driver and there was a reference from his employer in evidence offering to re-employ him. He married the complainant in 2000, and although the marriage was for the main part happy, the appellant began to suspect his wife of infidelity. This led to matrimonial disharmony and the incident of 16 July. 
     
      
    65 When interviewed for a pre-sentence report the appellant maintained his innocence of the malicious wounding offence. He said he took the children because he “did not know what [the complainant] was going to do”. The officer preparing the report came to the opinion that the appellant was trying to place blame on the complainant and lacked insight. 
     
      
    66 There was before the Judge a report from a psychologist that indicated that the appellant need “ongoing treatment for longstanding symptoms of depression and anxiety which have been aggravated by his incarceration”. At the time of being interviewed the appellant was suffering “significant depression, anxiety and low self-esteem”. The psychologist was of the opinion that with appropriate medical treatment and psychotherapy the appellant’s prognosis was positive. 
     
      
    67 The Judge found that the appellant was “extremely fond of his children” and that they were a major part of his life. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the abduction of the children was to some extent premeditated. I have also found that he took the knife with him, although I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, and I could not be in view of the jury’s verdict, that he intended to use it………………. 
         
        
       
       
      He held that the appellant resented losing the children, he blamed his wife and he “decided to take the law into his own hands”. The Judge went on: 
       
        
         
        In this country we have a complex system of family law, which is designed to protect the interests of both children and their parents. The offender decided to fly in the face of this system. I am not just talking about the Family Law Act, but I am talking about the laws relating to domestic violence. 
         
        
       
      
    68 The Judge determined that the offences were “very serious’ and that both general and personal deterrence were important factors in arriving at the appropriate sentence. His Honour referred to the decision of this Court in Hamid v R [2006] NSWCCA 302; 164 A Crim R 179 that was concerned with sentencing for offences amounting to domestic violence and the approach to be taken by the courts. In that case Justice Johnson, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        86 In sentencing a domestic violence offender, and in particular a repeat domestic violence offender, specific and general deterrence are important factors, together with the requirement of powerful denunciation by the community of such conduct and the need for protection of the community. Recognition of the harm done to the victim and the community as a result of crimes of domestic violence is important. These principles flow from statements of this Court and are fortified by the enactment of Division 1A of Part 15A of the  
        Crimes Act 1900  
        including the statutory objects recited in s.562AC. 
         
        
       
      
    69 In respect of the child abduction offences the Judge stated that the sentence without the pleas of guilty would have been 4 years. The sentences also took into account “his custody before trial and the restrictive bail conditions”. The appellant had served 3 months before being released to bail. The Judge also found special circumstances resulting from the fact that his time in custody would be more difficult because of depression and the fact that he would have no contact with his children. 
     
      
    70 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the child abduction offences were to the lower end of the scale notwithstanding that the Judge found that they were premeditated to a degree. Reliance was place upon the decision of this Court in WNB v R [2006] NSWCCA 269. The facts in that matter are that the appellant, who was the natural father of the child, took the child out of the care and control of the Minister for Community Services by removing the child from a family gathering. The appellant then took the child to Queensland where the child lived with the appellant and the natural mother. Eventually the police located the appellant and he was arrested. The appellant was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months with a non-parole period of 9 months. This Court intervened because of the manner in which the offence had been charged alleging a taking between 11.05 and 11.15am at Morisset. The Court held it could not take into account the detention of the child in Queensland. The sentence imposed was reduced to 12 months with a non-parole period of 6 months. 
     
      
    71 Nothing can be gleaned about the appropriateness of the sentences in the present case from that imposed in WBN because of the unusual nature of the charge in that case. In the present case apart from the ADVO the appellant would have been entitled to have custody of the children. But he knew about the order as he had consented to it. He knew its terms and he knew that the children were to be in the care and control of his wife. He carried out the threat he made on 16 July to “take the kids”. The Judge found that the offence was premeditated to a degree. On the other hand it was he who notified the police of his location and waited there while the police found him and took him into custody. There is not the slightest suggestion that the children were in anyway mistreated. Clearly seeing himself as part of a news item on the television brought the appellant to his senses. 
     
      
    72 We appreciate the discretion that resides in a sentencing judge particularly when he or she has conducted a trial and has a greater sense of the subtleties of the facts and personalities than might be obtained from reading the papers. However, as against a maximum penalty of 10 years, a starting sentence of four years is in our opinion manifestly too severe. It could not have reasonably been more than three years notwithstanding a degree of premeditation. This is made apparent by putting to one side the facts surrounding the stabbing and the method by which the appellant obtained the children. Had the appellant only been charged with the abduction offences, we cannot accept that a sentence of four years would have been appropriate for a person of prior good character who had the children for a short period of time, and who notified the police of his whereabouts voluntarily so that the children could be recovered. With respect we do not see sufficient, if any regard, being paid to the importance of this latter fact. The Judge stated that the break up of the family “has had a very profound effect on [the appellant] leading him to unwise actions”. Any gaol penalty imposed upon such a person presents strong denunciation of the offence and reflects a significant measure of general deterrence. 
     
      
    73 We appreciate that the sentences for the child abduction offences were to be served concurrently with the sentence for the malicious wounding offence except for a period of 18 months, but the reduced sentences we would impose affect the totality of the criminality and the degree to which the sentences for these offences should be served cumulatively with the sentence on the first count. Because of the sentence we intend to impose for the offence of malicious wounding, it is appropriate to impose a fixed term sentence for each count being the equivalent of the appropriate non-parole period for each of these offences. We have given the appellant the benefit of a discount of 15 per cent for his pleas. The sentence is backdated 3 months for pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
    74 Similarly we are of the view that a sentence of five years as against a maximum penalty of seven years was excessive for the offence in count 1. The difficulty is that as at the time of sentencing the appellant the maximum penalty for malicious wounding was the same as for maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm, yet the most serious wounding will inevitably amount to grievous bodily harm. Grievous bodily harm can cover injuries of very great seriousness amounting to little less than death, such as where the victim is left so seriously brain injured as to be in a vegetative state. On the other hand a wounding can be on its face a most minor injury because of the definition of “wound”. We note that under the present scheme of offences of wounding and the infliction of grievous bodily harm, the maximum penalty for wounding is still 7 years imprisonment, see s 35(4), but the maximum penalty for the infliction of grievous bodily harm is imprisonment for 10 years, s 35(2). 
     
      
    75 There were clearly aggravating factors present here in that the appellant was in breach of a court order protecting the complainant, it was a case of domestic violence, he brought a knife to the scene intending to use it in some way even if not to inflict injury of a serious kind, and there were several stabs aimed at the complainant even though only one connected. The physical injury inflicted was relatively minor although the psychological reaction of the complainant was understandably severe. The complainant had a two and a half centimetre laceration to her left upper arm that penetrated to the fatty structures under the skin. The wound was stitched. There was no suggestion of any permanent injury or scarring. She also had a number of superficial lacerations. As with all cases where the gravamen of the offence is the injury inflicted, that will generally be a very significant factor in determining the appropriate sentence. The Judge made no finding as to whether the malice was intent or recklessness but by reason of the nature of the weapon used and the number of stabbing actions we would find that the appellant intended to inflict some injury although not grievous bodily harm. In our opinion the proper sentence could not have reasonably been more than 3 years 6 months. 
     
      
    76 We have found special circumstances for the reasons given by his Honour. We intend that the appellant will serve an overall sentence of 4 years 6 months with an overall non-parole period of 3 years from 1 March 2007 
     
      
    77 In determining the sentences now to be imposed upon the appellant we have taken into account material tendered for this purpose as to the courses in which the appellant has been involved during the period of his imprisonment and his behaviour otherwise while in custody. This material shows a commitment by the appellant to make the most of his period in custody towards his rehabilitation. 
     
      
    78 The orders of the Court are: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The appeal against conviction is dismissed. 
        
       
       
       2. Application for leave to appeal is granted and the appeal allowed. 
       
       
       3. The sentences imposed in the District Court are quashed. 
       
       
       4. In lieu the appellant is sentenced as follows; 
       
       
        
         
          
          On each of counts 2-4: a fixed term of 15 months to date from 1 March 2007 and which expired on 31 May 2008. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          On count 1: a non-parole period of 2 years 3 months to date from 1 December 2007 with a balance of term of 18 months. The appellant is eligible to be released to parole on 1 March 2010.

     JUDGMENT 
    1 ALLSOP P: Gavin Mark Ridley (the appellant) appeals against his conviction and sentence following a jury verdict in respect of a trial in the District Court between 2 and 22 May 2007. 
     
      
    2 On 2 May 2007, the appellant pleaded not guilty to twelve counts on an indictment, nine counts relating to defrauding the Commonwealth contrary to the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth), s 29D and three counts of attempt by deception to dishonestly obtain a financial advantage contrary to the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth), ss 134.2 and 11.1. 
     
      
    3 The jury convicted the appellant on all twelve counts.  
     
      
    4 On 3 August 2007, Sorby DCJ sentenced the appellant in respect of each of the charges on which he had been found guilty to an effective overall period of imprisonment of 8 years with a non-parole period of 5 years. 
     
      
       
      The indictment 
       
      
    5 The indictment contained twelve counts as follows: 
     
      
       
      Counts 1 to 9: 
       
       
        
        “… On or about [date] at Sydney in the State of New South Wales did defraud the Commonwealth, namely the Commissioner of Taxation, in the sum of [$ amount] by causing to be lodged with the Australian Taxation Office a Business Activity Statement for the period [period] on behalf of [name of company] which falsely claimed a Goods and Services Tax refund of [$ amount].” 
        
       
       
      Counts 10 to 12:

      Relevant legislation 
       
      
    6 Section 29D of the Crimes Act provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person who defrauds the Commonwealth or a public authority under the Commonwealth is guilty of an indictable offence. 
         
         
        Penalty: 1000 penalty units or imprisonment for 10 years, or both.” 
        
       
      
    7 Section 134.2 of the Criminal Code provided:

        (a) the person, by a deception, dishonestly obtains a financial advantage from another person; and 
         
        (b) the other person is a Commonwealth entity. 
         
        Penalty: Imprisonment for 10 years. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) Absolute liability applies to the paragraph (1)(b) element of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    8 Section 11.1 of the Criminal Code provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person who attempts to commit an offence is guilty of the 
         
        offence of attempting to commit that offence and is punishable as if the offence attempted had been committed. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (2) For the person to be guilty, the person’s conduct must be more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence. The question whether conduct is more than merely preparatory to the commission of the offence is one of fact. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3) For the offence of attempting to commit an offence, intention and knowledge are fault elements in relation to each physical element of the offence attempted. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (3A) Subsection (3) has effect subject to subsection (6A).

        (5) A person who is found guilty of attempting to commit an offence cannot be subsequently charged with the completed offence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (6) Any defences, procedures, limitations or qualifying provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of attempting to commit that offence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (6A) Any special liability provisions that apply to an offence apply also to the offence of attempting to commit that offence. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        (7) It is not an offence to attempt to commit an offence against section 11.2 (complicity and common purpose), section 11.5 (conspiracy to commit an offence) or section 135.4 (conspiracy to defraud).” 
        
       
      
    9 Section 133.1 of the Criminal Code defined “deception” as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        deception  
        means an intentional or reckless deception, whether by words or other conduct, and whether as to fact or as to law, and 
         
        includes: 
         
        (a) a deception as to the intentions of the person using the 
         
        deception or any other person; and 
         
        (b) conduct by a person that causes a computer, a machine or an 
         
        electronic device to make a response that the person is not authorised to cause it to do.” 
        
       
      
    10 Section 130.3 of the Criminal Code provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the purposes of this Chapter,  
        dishonest  
        means: 
         
        (a) dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people; and 
         
        (b) known by the defendant to be dishonest according to the standards of ordinary people.” 
        
       
      
    11 Section 130.4 of the Criminal Code provided: 
     
      
       
        
        “In a prosecution for an offence against this Chapter, the determination of dishonesty is a matter for the trier of fact.” 
        
       
      
    The Crown case 
     
      
    12 It was the Crown case that during the period February 2001 to July 2001 the appellant dishonestly made false claims for refunds for Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) in twelve Business Activity Statements (“BASs”) submitted to the Australian Taxation Office by the appellant in the names of three companies controlled by him. The Crown said that in each, the subject BAS contained false information concerning alleged acquisitions claimed to have been made which incurred GST. It was said that the BASs falsely claimed that the companies in question had made these acquisitions and that the companies were entitled to a refund of the GST component of the acquisition. The total amount of tax claimed to be the subject of refund in the twelve charges was $2,858,160. The ATO paid over the claimed refunds for the first nine BASs (Counts 1 to 9), totalling $1,746,582. However, it did not pay over the amounts claimed in the last three BASs (Counts 10 to 12), totalling $1,111,578. 
     
      
    13 The GST system, and how it was administered, was explained to the jury by witnesses. It was explained that the GST was a consumption tax levied on the supply of goods, services and activities, and imposed at a rate of 10%. It was explained that in a typical situation in which goods were sold or services supplied, the seller or provider included the GST in the price of the goods or services and the seller or provider accounted to the Australian Taxation Office for the GST component in the sale. It was explained that if the buyer bought goods or services for its business purposes, the buyer was able to claim a credit for the amount of GST that it had paid. This credit was called an “input tax credit”. This credit was offset against any GST on goods or services that the buyer supplied to its own customers. 
     
      
    14 It was explained that as part of the administration of the GST scheme, businesses have to register with the ATO and that businesses account to the ATO for the GST on the supplies they make and obtain credits pursuant to claims for the GST input tax credits. These returns and claims are made in a BAS which the ATO requires to be completed monthly or quarterly. The system that operated was one of “self assessment” requiring the taxpayer to make an honest and complete return.  
     
      
    15 The GST legislation came into operation on 1 July 2000. 
     
      
    16 During 1998 and 1999, the appellant and a business partner, Mr Anthony Gee, were interested in establishing a business venture involving tyre recycling. The appellant participated in negotiations with representatives of a company called Link Pty Ltd (“Link”). Link’s founder, a Mr Wenzel, had invented a method of stripping and processing motor vehicle tyres to produce crumbed rubber material which could be used to make various rubber products. Link was in the business of making and selling speciality plant and equipment to undertake this manufacturing process. Link had a factory in Brisbane where its plant and machinery were demonstrated. The appellant and Mr Gee were interested in establishing manufacturing plants in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne to operate the Link recycling process and obtain from Link sole rights to use this process in defined areas. This proposal was subject to the appellant and Mr Gee raising all of the required funds from potential investors. 
     
      
    17 Three companies were incorporated by the appellant and Mr Gee to operate the proposed businesses: Envirotyre Industries Pty Ltd (“Envirotyre Industries”); Southern Rubber Technology Pty Ltd (“Southern Rubber Technology”); and Queensland Tyre Resources Pty Ltd (“Queensland Tyre Resources”). In addition, the appellant incorporated two other companies: Envirotyre Management Pty Ltd (“Envirotyre Management”) and Envirotyre Sales Pty Ltd (“Envirotyre Sales”). These five companies comprised what was referred to as the Envirotyre Group. 
     
      
    18 The appellant drafted a heads of agreement document between Envirotyre Management and Link which came to be dated 23 December 1998. The heads of agreement outlined a proposal to purchase plant and machinery from Link and Link’s agreement to supply exclusively such plant and machinery to Envirotyre Management in a defined geographic area (Queensland, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia). The appellant later substituted another company which he and Mr Gee controlled, Interequity Capital Management Limited (Hong Kong) (“Interequity”), for Envirotyre Management in the heads of agreement. The heads of agreement concerned a proposed arrangement for the supply of technical equipment and machinery. It referred to the obtaining of a $10m letter of credit for the purchasing of the Link plant and machinery for three factories by 30 September 1999, that date being the final date for the entering into of a binding contract. Under the heads of agreement, Link also permitted the use of its name “within public documents that are required for the capital raising process”. The final clause of the heads of agreement stated that the heads of agreement represented the understanding of the parties with respect to the matters referred and, except for two clauses, the heads of agreement was not binding.  
     
      
    19 The appellant and Mr Gee set about attempting to raise large sums of money from potential investors to establish three separate ventures for a factory in each of three different states. Seventeen million dollars was sought to be raised from the public for each of three ventures under a prospectus. These efforts were unsuccessful. Interim stop orders were imposed by the Australian Securities and Investments Commission on the use of the prospectuses and final stop orders were placed on the prospectuses in August 2000. 
     
      
    20 The money required for preparing the prospectuses and other start up costs of $20,000 came from the appellant. The appellant claimed in cross-examination that both he and Mr Gee advanced about $150,000 each to Envirotyre Management in or by November 2000. There was no documentary or bank evidence to substantiate this in the evidence. 
     
      
    21 At no time was there ever any purchase of plant or equipment or technology rights from Link made by the appellant or Mr Gee or by any of the companies referred to above associated with them; nor was any contract or arrangement ever entered into with Link (other than the heads of agreement). Envirotyre Industries, Southern Rubber Technology, and Queensland Tyre Resources never operated any business. These three companies were, however, registered with the ATO for taxation and GST purposes. 
     
      
    22 In early February 2001, the ATO received notification of a change to the bank details for the above three companies. The new bank account was at the Commonwealth Bank in the name of “Envirotyre Group”. The persons nominated to operate the account were the appellant, Mr Gee and Mr Gee’s father. 
     
      
    23 On the day that the ATO received notification of this change of bank account, three BASs were lodged with the ATO for the three companies, Envirotyre Industries, Southern Rubber Technology and Queensland Tyre Resources, for the quarter July to September 2000. In each respective BAS, the relevant company claimed a GST input credit in relation to “other acquisitions”, but otherwise revealed no financial activity resulting in tax implications for the quarter. Envirotyre Industries claimed an input tax credit of $144,960 (Count 1); Queensland Tyre Resources claimed an input tax credit of $83,730 (Count 2); and Southern Rubber Technology claimed an input tax credit of $139,536 (Count 3). 
     
      
    24 On 7 February 2001, three BASs were lodged with the ATO for the three companies for the quarter October to December 2000. In each respective BAS, the relevant company claimed an “input tax credit in relation to other acquisitions”, but otherwise revealed no financial activity resulting in any tax implications for that quarter. Envirotyre Industries claimed an input tax credit of $173,880 (Count 4); Queensland Tyre Resources claimed an input tax credit of $100,403 (Count 5); Southern Rubber Technology claimed an input tax credit of $167,371 (Count 6). 
     
      
    25 On 15 Feburary 2001, the ATO refunded the amounts claimed in each of the six BASs filed up to that point, by way of direct transfer to the Envirotyre Group bank account. 
     
      
    26 On 20 April 2001, three BASs were lodged for the three companies for the quarter January to March 2001. Each of the companies claimed an “input tax credit in relation to other acquisitions”, but otherwise revealed no financial activity resulting in tax implications for the quarter. Envirotyre Industries claimed an input tax credit of $376,959 (Count 7); Queensland Tyre Resources claimed an input tax credit of $201,567 (Count 8); and Southern Rubber Technology claimed an input tax credit of $355,223 (Count 9). 
     
      
    27 On 30 April 2001, the ATO refunded the claimed amount for Envirotyre Industries’ BAS for the quarter January to March 2001. 
     
      
    28 On 22 May 2001, the ATO refunded the amount claimed by Queensland Tyre Resources, plus $614.81 interest for late refunding for the same period. 
     
      
    29 The evidence disclosed that in early June 2001, a compliance officer of the ATO, a Ms Janceska, telephoned the appellant to ascertain further details about the January to March 2001 BAS for Southern Rubber Technology. She asked what the main business activity of the company was. The appellant told her that it was tyre recycling and that a plant was being set up and should be completed by October 2001. Ms Janceska queried the acquisitions nominated in the BAS as amounting to $3,907,453. She said she would need a breakdown of the expenses to verify the amount. She gave the appellant her facsimile number.  
     
      
    30 On or about 4 June 2001, Ms Janceska received a facsimile transmission on Southern Rubber Technology letterhead signed by the appellant. The document stated the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “Following our telephone conversation on Friday of last week, please find enclosed the details for the breakdown of “G11 – other acquisitions” as requested. 
        
       
       
        
        #1 Vendor: Tiphaze Pty Ltd 
        
       
       
        
        Supply: Tyre Recycling Technology Licence Fee 
        
       
       
        
        Amount: $1,684,030.00 incl GST 
        
       
       
        
        #2 Vendor: Tiphaze Pty Ltd 
        
       
       
        
         Supply: Tyre Recycling Processing Equipment – first installation/hire payment 
        
       
       
        
         Amount: $2,219,465.00 incl GST 
        
       
       
        
        #3 Vendor: FPD Savilles Pty Ltd 
        
       
       
        
         Supply: Office Rental 
        
       
       
        
         Amount: $3,958.00 incl GST 
        
       
       
        
         Total of G11 “other acquisitions” - $3,907,453.00 
        
       
       
        
        I trust that this provides the information that you require such that our refund can now be processed.” 
        
       
      
    31 After receiving this document, Ms Janceska requested the appellant to provide invoices from the suppliers. Ms Janceska then received two invoices which were in evidence, both dated 15 January 2001. They were sent to her by facsimile. The invoices purported to be from “Tiphaze Pty Ltd – The Industrial Process People”. After receipt of these invoices, Ms Janceska decided to allow the processing of the refund for the quarter January to March 2001 for Southern Rubber Technology. On 18 June 2001, a taxation refund was made, plus a sum $2,338.24 by way of interest for late refund payment. 
     
      
    32 The above two invoices contained line items for the price of “Core Technology Licence Fee – Link Process Installation; Southern Rubber Technologies Tyre Plant”; and “Equipment Supply/Licence – Link Process Installation; Southern Rubber Technologies Tyre Plant Stage 1, include: PS 6000 Shredder, SH 1500 Grinding/Granulation System, FST 3000 Fibre System, SCR 2400 Screening System, Computer Controller and Process Module.” The prices in the two invoices were ex GST, with a line item of a GST component. Each invoice contained at the bottom of the page the statement: “All accounts due and payable 30 days from invoice date.” 
     
      
    33 On 12 July 2001, three BASs were lodged for the three companies for the quarter April to June 2001. Envirotyre Industries claimed an input tax credit of $457,192 (Count 10); Queensland Tyre Resources claimed an input tax credit of $230,310 (Count 11); and Southern Rubber Technology claimed an input tax credit of $424,076 (Count 12). 
     
      
    34 On or about 20 July 2001, another ATO officer, Mr Hale, telephoned the appellant concerning the April to June 2001 BAS for Queensland Tyre Resources. When he questioned the appellant about the purchases of $2,533,410 referred to in the BAS, the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The amount was to set up a factory to recycle car tyres by shredding them into small rubber pellets and turning them into new products.” 
        
       
      
    35 Mr Hale asked the appellant to send him a copy of the tax invoice for verification purposes. On 31 July 2001, Mr Hale received a facsimile with Queensland Tyre Resources letterhead signed by and in the handwriting of the appellant. The coversheet stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “David, sorry for the delay. I had to retrieve the document back from the accountant. Any questions please call.” 
        
       
      
    36 The copy invoice supplied was a Tiphaze Pty Ltd tax invoice dated 6 June 2001. The invoice in the description column identified: 
     
      
       
        
        “Equipment Supply/Licence - Link Process Installation; Queensland Tyre Resources Tyre Plant Stage 1; Include: PS 3000 Shredder, SH 1500 Grinding/Granulation System; FST 3000 Fibre System, SCR 2400 screening system, computer controller and process module.” 
        
       
      
    37 Mr Hale then made enquiries of ATO records concerning the company Tiphaze Pty Ltd and identified a telephone number for the accountants for the company. On 1 August 2001, Mr Hale spoke to someone at that firm and asked for some verification of the invoice. No response was ever forthcoming. 
     
      
    38 On 2 August 2001, Mr Hale again spoke to the appellant on the telephone. Mr Hale asked the appellant some questions concerning the business of Queensland Tyre Resources. Mr Hale asked the appellant where the Queensland Tyre Resources factory was. The appellant said that it was at Beaudesert, but that he could not give the precise address and said that he would get back to Mr Hale. Mr Hale asked if there were any employees there. The appellant said that there were not, but there would eventually be 13 employees on the site. The appellant said that in all there would be 64 employees working for the group. The appellant said that Tiphaze staff were currently at the site (of Queensland Tyre Resources’ factory). The appellant told Mr Hale that Tiphaze was manning the plant (in Queensland) and that he dealt with Ryner Wenzel and Peter Cook from Tiphaze. 
     
      
    39 On 8 August 2001, under cover of a facsimile headed “Envirotyre Group” and signed by the appellant, Mr Hale received two further invoices from Tiphaze dated 6 June 2001 relating to Envirotyre Industries and Southern Rubber Technologies having information of the kind referred to earlier under the description column with substantial amounts of payment, each over $4m and GST for each company over $400,000. 
     
      
    40 Thereafter, another ATO officer, Mr Brown was given the ATO files of the three companies for the purpose of auditing their BASs. Mr Brown made a number of unsuccessful telephone calls to the appellant and left messages for him. On 6 September 2001, Mr Brown received a telephone call from the appellant. During the telephone conversation, the appellant said words to the effect: 
     
      
       
        
        “They would have a factory operating at some point where they could install all the machinery and press a button and the thing would start operating.” 
        
       
       
      The appellant said the factory would be operational next year. Mr Brown requested documentation to support the BASs and requested a meeting. ATO letters (one for each company) were sent to the appellant on 13 September 2001 confirming what was required to be produced. 
       
      
    41 On 17 September 2001, Mr Brown and a colleague (Jan Campbell) visited the appellant at his office premises at 2 Bulletin Place, Sydney. During conversation with them, the appellant confirmed preparing the BASs for each of the companies. The appellant produced 15 original invoices which purported to relate to the acquisitions in the 12 BASs which had been lodged. Mr Brown inspected these invoices and obtained copies. The invoices each had individual invoice numbers which, on their face, disclosed that a number of invoices (apart from these 15) had been issued by Tiphaze; that is, there appeared to be consecutive numbered invoices with other invoices between the numbers on the invoices produced. After some further conversation about a technology licence fee, the appellant produced three separate documents which purported to be licensing agreements between Southern Rubber Technology, Queensland Tyre Resources and Envirotyre Industries with Tiphaze. Mr Brown asked for copies of these agreements, but was told by the appellant that for legal reasons he could not be given the whole document. The appellant gave Mr Brown photocopies of extracts of the document.  
     
      
    42 Mr Brown then asked questions about addresses, locations of factories, payments and financing of the operation. The appellant said that they were originally going ahead with a prospectus but “we now have private backing from a BRW Top 200 person in Victoria”. The appellant showed Mr Brown a document entitled “Envirotyre Group Prospectus”. When asked about proof of payment, the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “No payments have been made at this point. We’ve simply invoiced as per the agreement. The schedule of payments in the agreement.” 
        
       
       
      The appellant also said: 
       
       
        
        “Delivery hasn’t occurred, installation hasn’t taken place because we’ve got a dispute with the supplier, Tiphaze, and we also have some issues with the sites in that we haven’t secured the locations for the reasons of a dispute with the EPA.” 
        
       
      
    43 On 21 September 2001, Mr Brown left a telephone message for the appellant requesting amongst other things the location of the factory sites. Later that day Mr Brown received an email from the appellant stating: 
     
      
       
        
        “Locations being secured subject to required approvals: 36 Lisbon Street, Fairfield; 29 and 31 Reo Cr, Campbelltown; site in Redbank Plains Road, Blackstone or Coopers Plains to be determined. Subject to above along with lease issues.” 
        
       
      
    44 On 26 September 2001, Mr Brown checked one of the site location addresses that had been given to him, namely 36 Lisbon Street, Fairfield. He found that it consisted of a vacant factory with a for sale or lease sign outside. 
     
      
    45 On 28 September 2001, Mr Brown telephoned the appellant’s office and was told by the receptionist that the appellant was not in and that she did not know when to expect him. Mr Brown attended the appellant’s business premises on 8 October and was told that the appellant was overseas. 
     
      
    46 On 30 April 2002, a search warrant was executed on the appellant’s business premises at Bulletin Place and various documents and computer material were seized. Documents located during the police search included three “licence agreements” each dated 8 September 2000, which had been shown to Mr Brown on 17 September 2001. According to the terms of these licence agreements, the licensor (Tiphaze) purported to confer “certain rights in relation to certain hardware and technology” to Southern Rubber Technology, Queensland Tyre Resources and Envirotyre Industries. Each of the documents was executed. They appear to have been signed by Mr Gee (in stamped signature) on behalf of the three companies and by the appellant on behalf of Tiphaze. 
     
      
    47 Federal Police printed out hard copies of various computer files seized from the appellant’s computer. The computer files that related to Tiphaze invoices showed that the files were all (first) created on Sunday 16 September 2001, the day before the ATO officer, Mr Brown visited the appellant. The computer files that related to the licence agreements dated 8 September 2000 showed that the files were (first) created on 21 February 2001 and last modified on 16 September 2001. 
     
      
    48 Evidence concerning Tiphaze was presented at the trial. According to incorporated records, Tiphaze was incorporated in 2000 and registered in New South Wales. Its sole director and shareholder was Mr Mark Heasman. Tiphaze was registered with the ATO and provided with a tax file number. According to information supplied to the ATO, Tiphaze’s principal business activity was labour hire. Seized from the business premises of the appellant were some (unregistered) documents, some bearing the date 15 June 2001 transferring ownership of Tiphaze (the documents included resignation of the director, appointment of new director and transfer of shares). 
     
      
    49 Evidence was given at the trial by Mr Lance Heasman, the brother of Mr Mark Heasman, who had recently died. Lance Heasman was the managing director of a crane hire company. In the year 2000, he purchased a number of shelf companies through a firm of accountants (Cassaniti and Associates). One of these companies was Tiphaze. He caused his brother, Mark Heasman, who was one of his employees, to become the sole director of that company. Lance Heasman said that he was planning to use these shelf companies to re-structure his crane-hire business, but subsequently changed his mind. Lance Heasman employed Mr Gee as a business consultant. During 2000, Mr Gee told Lance Heasman that he could use the company Tiphaze if it was not required. Lance Heasman got his brother to sign various company documents (in blank) to transfer Tiphaze. He understood that these documents were taken away by Mr Gee. 
     
      
    50 Evidence was given at the trial concerning the address which appeared at the bottom of the Tiphaze invoices, namely Suite 179, 3 Holtermann Street, Crows Nest. 3 Holtermann Street was a shop which offered mail boxes for rent. The appellant first applied to rent mail box No 179 on 4 May 2001. 
     
      
    51 Evidence was given at the trial that the factory premises at 36 Lisbon Street, Fairfield were purchased by a company called Eagle Fly Pty Ltd which had, until 2003, no association with the appellant or Mr Gee. A tyre recycling plant using Link equipment was established there by Eagle Fly during the years 2001-2002. 
     
      
    52 The appellant gave evidence at the trial. His evidence was to the effect that at the time of lodging the various BASs he intended establishing tyre recycling businesses. He claimed that he thought he was entitled and was indeed obliged to lodge these BASs as the acquisitions claimed in them were (or would be) made. He claimed that Interequity had claimed the rights to the Link Tyre Recycling System through the heads of agreement document and that Tiphaze, as agent of Interequity, was entitled to and did, enter into licensing agreements with Southern Rubber Technology, Queensland Resources and Envirotyre Industries. He said that the acquisitions in the BASs were referred to in the three licensing agreements. He claimed that the prospectuses which were issued to raise money for the proposed ventures stated that Interequity owned Link Technology and that he believed that this was so, as he had received advice to this effect from a lawyer. In his cross-examination he stated the following which was the essence of his explanation: 
     
      
       
        
        “My honest belief was at all times there was a right to claim the input tax credits as they were put forward otherwise we wouldn’t have put them forward in the first place. There was [sic] investors coming in. There was a variety of discussion going on to move the business forward and these activity statements were filled out on the premise that the business was still moving forward.” 
        
       
       
      Issues at the trial 
       
      
    53 Before coming to the notice of appeal and the grounds of appeal, it is important to understand, in essence, how the cases were put at the trial. The Crown case was that there were no transactions involving Tiphaze or any of the three companies in whose names the BASs were lodged. The Crown case was that the claims for GST refunds were based on fictitious transactions, that Tiphaze had nothing to sell or supply and that the supporting documentation generated by the appellant, including the Tiphaze invoices and licensing agreements, were shams created to fool the ATO. In those circumstances, the appellant was necessarily and obviously acting dishonestly in submitting the claims for taxation refunds. 
     
      
    54 The appellant’s case was that the claims for input tax credits were based on genuine transactions or, at least, that the appellant believed that they were genuine transactions, the Tiphaze invoices reflected actual transactions and Tiphaze was acting in those transactions as the agent for Interequity. Interequity had (or the appellant believed that it had) obtained rights under the heads of agreement to the subject matter of the Tiphaze invoices. The three companies were entitled or obliged to account for the Tiphaze invoices in their BASs, even though no actual money was paid as the three companies reported to the ATO on an accruals basis. The appellant was not acting dishonestly in submitting the claims for taxation refunds. 
     
      
    55 This claim of the appellant involved the proposition that under the heads of agreement, Interequity had acquired (or at least the appellant believed it had acquired) rights to the “Link tyre recycling process”. The appellant relied on the prospectuses dated 19 May 2000 to support his claim about the acquiring of rights. The appellant pointed to parts of the prospectus in which it was said that Interequity had such rights and had licensed (or would license) such rights to Envirotyre Industries, Southern Rubber Technology and Queensland Tyre Resources.  
     
      
    56 Whether Interequity had in fact acquired the property referred to in the Tiphaze invoices and therefore had the legal capacity to transfer or license to the three companies that property was an issue at the trial. A direction from the trial judge concerning the heads of agreement was therefore necessary.  
     
      
    57 In Mr Lowe’s address to the jury on behalf of the appellant, it was suggested the Crown case had failed to appreciate and understand “the notion of managed investments of which the joint venture under the prospectus was one”.  
     
      
    58 The only agreement that was proved to have existed between Link and Interequity was that contained in the amended heads of agreement, that is, the heads of agreement in which Interequity was the substituted party, being the agreement dated 23 December 1998, which was drafted by the appellant. There was no subsequent agreement between the parties as contemplated in that document, binding or otherwise. The heads of agreement concerned a proposed arrangement for the supply of technical equipment and machinery. The reference to rights was in clause 2 where the word “rights” was used in the following sense: 
     
      
       
        
        “Further, Link will supply exclusively to [Envirotyre/Interequity] in the Territories only, and [Envirotyre/Interequity] agrees to acquire the distribution and supply rights to the equipment and technology developed, owned, produced by or licensed to Link (“rights“) in the Territories geographical areas so defined in Schedule B.” 
        
       
      
    59 Nowhere in the heads of agreement was the sale of the intellectual property to the Link tyre recycling process envisaged. I have already set out clause 11 of the heads of agreement. The qualification to the lack of any binding arrangement reflected in clause 11 concerned clauses 9 and 10 which were directed to ensuring that Link did not sell its machinery to anyone else in the designated geographical area during the term of the heads of agreement, being 23 December 1998 to 31 July 1999. 
     
      
    60 None of the stipulations provided for in the heads of agreement, including the furnishing of a $10M letter of credit was met by Interequity. 
     
      
    61 On the face of the agreement, as a matter of law, Interequity did not at any time acquire any rights from Link arising from the heads of agreement. There was no other evidence of any other source of rights.  
     
      
    62 There was no other basis in the evidence for any conclusion as a matter of law that the Tiphaze invoices reflected genuine transactions. There was no documentary evidence of any connection between Tiphaze and Interequity, nor any evidence other than what the appellant said at the trial that Tiphaze was the agent for Interequity. 
     
      
    63 In his address to the jury, Mr Lowe, counsel for the appellant, put the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “If you accept that he (the appellant) had an honest mistaken belief, putting aside the issue of law, but he had a mistaken belief [that] the heads of agreement conferred rights, technology rights, hire equipment rights and the like. If you accept he had an honestly mistaken belief the heads of agreement conferred rights to the use of the technology or access to the use of technology then at the end of the day I will be putting to you that you must acquit my client.” 
        
       
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
       
      Ground one: 
        
      the trial judge erred in law when he directed the jury regarding the legal effect of the heads of agreement 
       
      
    64 The direction of the trial judge was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… you have heard evidence in both the Crown case and from the accused as to the existence to two documents entitled heads of agreement – essentially the same document but with different parties and the documents are before you. Both documents were not expressed to be, nor were they, binding contracts – and this is a direction of law I give you. A binding contract: the terms of the document indicate that they were intended to be, namely,” the understanding of the parties with respect to the matters referred to above, and is not … binding on any party”, which is clause 11. 
        
       
       
        
        Neither Mr Wenzel signing those documents, nor the payment of $20,000 by the accused, had the consequence of altering the nature of those documents into binding contracts. As a matter of law no property of any kind passed under the terms of those documents.” 
        
       
      
    65 Mr Lowe, on appeal, argued that this was an incorrect conclusion from the heads of agreement. I do not agree. It was plainly correct. It was plainly an arrangement to be binding in only the limited sense identified by clauses 9 and 10.  
     
      
    66 Detailed submissions were put on behalf of the appellant that somehow the surrounding circumstances of the prospectuses elevated the heads of agreement to some legal effect not reflected in the words. I reject this submission. The evidence did not support any such proposition. The trial judge was plainly correct in his direction. 
     
      
    67 There was a submission that there was a conferral of rights under the heads of agreement by part performance. This was said to be by the payment of $20,000. No basis in the evidence arose for this conclusion. 
     
      
    68 It was also said that subsequent conduct of the parties created a body of rights. In particular, it was said that Mr Wenzel and Link continued their dealings with the Envirotyre Group of companies including in relation to the issue of prospectuses in which they permitted their names to be used. None of these matters were a foundation for any conclusion that there were rights in the nature reflected in the invoices; nor does any of this material invalidate in any way the direction of the trial judge. 
     
      
    69 The matter was also put as a question of estoppel. No factual foundation was made out in the evidence for such a proposition. 
     
      
    70 Ground one fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground two: a substantial miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of the trial judge to give proper and/or adequate directions to the jury regarding the “claim of right” argument advanced on behalf of the appellant 
       
      
    71 The appellant contended that the trial judge failed to give proper and/or adequate directions to the jury regarding the claim of right argument said to be advanced by trial counsel. This failure was both in respect of a claim of right as understood at common law (in respect of the first nine counts) as well as under the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth), s 9.5 (in respect of the last three counts). His Honour was also said to be in error in not permitting trial counsel for the appellant to address the jury regarding conferral of rights under the heads of agreement or mistaken belief that rights were so conferred and/or that a contract by way of conduct subsequently came into existence outside the heads of agreement. 
     
      
    72 It was not put by the trial judge or Crown Prosecutor that because of the legal effect of the heads of agreement the appellant’s view (albeit mistaken) about them and the legal effect of the document was irrelevant. It was recognised by the Crown that an alleged honest but mistaken belief of the appellant as to the legal effect of the heads of agreement and its alleged consequences was relevant to whether he had acted fraudulently or dishonestly.  
     
      
    73 The Crown objected to a specific direction on a “claim of right”. This objection was rightly made in my view. It was not a claim of right that was the relevant issue, it was whether the appellant knowingly made a false claim, which in truth did not exist, the appellant knowing that to be the case. This issue went squarely to the jury. During the trial judge’s summing up, a document was handed to each of the jurors setting out the elements of the charges in the counts. The document was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Counts 1 - 9 
         
         
        In these counts in order to prove that the accused is guilty the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt in each count that: 
         
         
        1. a GST refund was made (as alleged in the particular count) by the Commonwealth (ATO); 
         
         
        2. the refund of GST was made pursuant to a false claim (ie a claim which in truth did not exist and a claim which the particular company was not entitled to make) for a refund; 
         
         
        3. the accused made the false claim for a refund knowing that the claim was false and in so doing was acting dishonestly. 
        
       
       
        
        Counts 10, 11 & 12 
         
         
        In these counts in order to prove that the accused is guilty the Crown must prove beyond reasonable doubt in each count that: 
         
         
        1. a claim for a refund of GST was made (as alleged in the particular count) to the Commonwealth (ATO); 
         
         
        2. that the claimed refund was a false claim (ie a claim which in truth did not exist and a claim which the particular company was not entitled to make); 
         
         
        3. that the claimed refund was made by the accused with the intention that the ATO make the refund; 
         
         
        4. the accused made the false claim for a refund knowing that the claim was false and in so doing was acting dishonestly. 
        
       
      
    74 The trial judge also said the following to the jury: 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury, the accused says that when he filled in the BAS forms, the subject of each of the twelve counts on the indictment, or in the case of the first nine counts, they were filled in by Mr Gee, each one seeking a refund from the ATO, he held an honest if mistaken belief that he was entitled to the refunds claimed. The Crown must prove to you that what he did in filing the BAS forms was a dishonest act, that is, the accused was acting dishonestly as I have defined that word for you. The accused says that what he did was not dishonest. “ 
        
       
       
        
       
      These directions served crisply to focus the jury’s mind on the relevant issue in the case concerning the appellant’s knowledge and state of mind, relevant to which was his sworn evidence upon which he was cross-examined that he honestly believed he was entitled to make the claim. There was no misdirection by the judge and no failure by the judge to admit any relevant defence or aspect of the defence to be put to the jury. The jury could not have been in any doubt from the summing up that what they had to decide was whether the accused was telling the truth about his state of mind and about the falsity or genuineness of his actions.  
       
       
      Ground three 
      :  
      a substantial miscarriage of justice was occasioned by the failure of the trial judge to redirect the jury regarding the appellant’s mistaken belief upon being requested to do so by trial counsel for the appellant 
       
      
    75 The appellant contended that the failure to redirect the jury in relation to mistaken belief upon being requested to do so by trial counsel, left the summing-up in respect of the case of the appellant without a fair balance. 
     
      
    76 It was submitted that some further redirection was required because of what was said to be the vigorous and extensive cross-examination of the appellant by the Crown Prosecutor and the so-called interjection of the prosecutor’s personal views and editorial comments into the questions he was asking. The appellant’s counsel submitted that the cross-examination of the appellant verged on the unfair and had a tendency to deflect the jury from a proper assessment of the credibility of the appellant. This, it was said, was compounded by the trial judge’s direction to the jury that they must pay attention to all the questions and answers that were given by the appellant before they reached a conclusion about his evidence. 
     
      
    77 The criticism of the Crown Prosecutor’s cross-examination was not warranted. The cross-examination was vigorous; the case was a fraud case, on the Crown case. The Crown case was to the effect that the so-called honest belief was nothing more than dishonesty in the witness box. 
     
      
    78 The case very much turned upon whether the jury believed the evidence of the appellant. Plainly it did not. The claim of right as a separate head of direction had nothing to do with the matter beyond the appellant’s assertion of his honest but mistaken belief which was squarely raised by him and his counsel. The cross-examination of the appellant was vigorous, but fair. 
     
      
    79 This ground of the appeal fails.  
     
      
    80 All three grounds having failed, the appeal against conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Appeal against sentence 
       
      
    81 The sentences imposed upon the appellant were as follows: as to Counts 10, 11 and 12, fixed terms of two years for each count, to be served concurrently to commence on 24 May 2007 and to conclude on 23 May 2009; as to Counts 1 to 6, fixed terms of three years for each count, to be served concurrently to commence 24 May 2008 and to conclude 23 May 2011; as to Counts 7, 8 and 9, fixed terms of three years and six months for each count, to be served concurrently to commence 24 November 2008 and to conclude on 23 May 2012, with a further period of three years parole to commence on 24 May 2012 and to conclude on 23 May 2015. 
     
      
    82 In other words, the appellant was sentenced to somewhat under eight years imprisonment, including three years parole and thus to serve somewhat under five years in prison.  
     
      
       
      Ground one 
       
      
    83 The first ground of appeal against sentence was that the sentencing judge erred in finding that the commission of offences involved a breach of trust. This involved the following reference by the sentencing judge: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offences are objectively serious. The total amount of money is considerable and involved a breach of trust, the Australian Taxation Office relying on the honesty of the offender to lodge legitimate GST claims with authentic supporting documents. The offences involve fraud of [sicl on] all members of the community who pay their taxes.”  
        
       
      
    84 In effect this was a reference to the self assessment system that has been the relevant taxing regime for some years. This system relies on the honesty of individual taxpayers, subject to the conducting of audits. The evidence given by Mr Bowmer of the ATO was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Federal tax system is based on self assessment, which was introduced a number of years ago, and what that means is that the Commissioner accepts that taxpayers take reasonable care and make an honest attempt to meet their obligations, their tax obligations, and that includes things like keeping records that they are required to keep and lodging returns and activity statements so that the information is correct. So when those statements and returns are lodged, the Commissioner will accept those and relies on the information that the taxpayer has provided that they have made a reasonable attempt and an honest attempt to meet their obligations, unless he has reason to believe otherwise and this applies to both income tax returns and business activity statements.” 
        
       
      
    85 This is in terms a kind of trust. Members of the community rely on each other for honesty for the operation of the tax system. It was a legitimate comment by the primary judge and an entirely legitimate consideration. 
     
      
       
      Ground two 
       
      
    86 The second ground of appeal against sentence was that the sentencing judge erred by placing disproportionate weight on the need for personal deterrence. 
     
      
    87 The sentencing judge referred to the need for specific deterrence as being, with other considerations and with general deterrence, an important aspect of the sentencing exercise.88 The sentencing judge also made some remarks concerning the prospects of rehabilitation of the appellant, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender has no prior convictions and this will be his first experience of prison. Given this factor and his age the experience will be more onerous than otherwise. The offender’s unblemished record, his character and his past experience in the community are indicative of good prospects of rehabilitation on the part of the offender.” 
        
       
      
    89 Thus, it was said that the reference to the need for specific deterrence was misplaced and was reflective of a harsh view taken of the appellant’s offending conduct. I do not think that there is any inconsistency in the remarks, nor do I think that the sentencing judge placed any disproportionate weight on personal deterrence.  
     
      
    90 The Crown’s submission stressed the importance of general deterrence. The sentencing judge in his remarks said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I said earlier, both specific and importantly general deterrence are important aspects in the sentencing exercise and in addition, retribution, the protection of society and rehabilitation. General deterrence, because taxation fraud is notoriously difficult to detect, investigate and prosecute successfully, is very important. “ 
        
       
      
    91 A review of the judge’s sentencing remarks does not indicate any overall disproportionate weight to personal deterrence inconsistent with the prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    92 The third ground of appeal against sentence was that the sentencing judge erred by imposing a sentence that was unduly harsh and manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    93 I reject this ground. The conduct of the appellant was extensive, concerning a very large sum of money and, to a degree, brazen.  
     
      
    94 In my view, the overall sentence was well within the permissible range for a serious fraud on the revenue of this kind. 
     
      
    95 It was submitted that the appellant did not personally benefit to the full extent of the depredation on the ATO. Evidence was tendered at the sentencing hearing as to what happened to the money after it was paid. The evidence was that approximately $1.2m went into an account controlled Mr Gee and $442,000 went into the account of an entity controlled by the appellant. However, there was no evidence as to why and how this occurred. It could not necessarily be assumed that the direction of the money to Mr Gee was something other than with the consent of, and to the advantage of, the appellant.  
     
      
    96 Whatever be the position as to the division of the proceeds of the fraud, in my view, the sentence was a fair one given the serious imposition on the Commonwealth and the public by these frauds. 
     
      
    97 I would grant leave to appeal on sentence and dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    98 The orders that I would make are: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed. 
       
       
      2. Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
       
      3. Appeal against sentence dismissed.

    100 PRICE J: I agree.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: In March 2005 the appellant stood trial before Black DCJ and a jury on an indictment charging seven counts of sexual intercourse with CD, a child then aged 14 years (Crimes Act, 1900, s 66C(3)). The sexual acts were alleged to have taken place on dates or between dates in the overall period 11 August 2003 to 26 September 2003.  
     
      
    2 The jury returned verdicts of guilty on all counts. The appellant was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment for 4 years commencing on 24 October 2005 with non-parole periods of 3 years.  
     
      
    3 The appellant appealed against conviction. He brought and prosecuted the appeal without legal representation.  
     
      
    4 The notice of appeal was filed on 17 August 2006, some seventeen months after the appellant was convicted and sentenced, and an extension of time is required. When invited to explain the delay, the appellant said that he had not been able to get legal representation and was out of his depth, that he wanted to present things to the Court with proof, and that he had done his best; it is not clear, but he may have meant also that his time was taken up in defending charges of some drug offences. This was not a satisfactory explanation for the delay. However, the Crown made no submission against, or even about, an extension of time. The appellant’s difficulties in proceeding unrepresented were evident, and it may be accepted that they contributed to the delay. In the particular circumstances, an extension of time should be granted. 
     
      
    5 The appellant did not formulate grounds of appeal in the conventional manner. He filed as grounds of appeal a document listing 25 points, another listing 28 points (“the 28 point document”), and as submissions a further document with seventeen paragraphs broadly concerning the same points which could be taken as grounds of appeal. The nature of his complaints can be seen from the 28 point document - 
     
      
       
        
        “1. Supreme Court appeal matter on conviction only. 
         
         
        2. Credibility of evidence of principle [sic; and elsewhere] witness. 
         
         
        3. Inconsistency of witness in cross and statements. 
         
         
        4. Contradictory of principle witness statement and cross-examination uncreditable witness. 
         
         
        5. Self admissions of principle witness lying in statements and cross-examinations. 
         
         
        6. Certificates issued to crown witness to avoid charges of perjury and later charges in relation to statements and evidence given. 
         
         
        7. Inducement by police to crown witness for favourable evidence ‘change these statements’. 
         
         
        8. Evidence not corroborated by crown witness as stated to jury by crown ‘misleading’. 
         
         
        9. Burden of proof and testing of evidence by crown not achieved. 
         
         
        10. Misleading of jurors in evidence by crown stating untrue facts knowingly and irrelevant facts. 
         
         
        11. Weight of hearsay and circumstantial evidence. 
         
         
        12. Precedents on un-credibility [sic] and inconsistency of crown witness. 
         
         
        13. Weight of signed supreme court affidavit by principle witness (stating case is not true) being the first statement, before police statement some near four months on any charges. 
         
         
        14. Coercion of principle witness to give evidence. 
         
         
        15. Principle witness giving multiple inconsistent statements with admissions of lying about facts. 
         
         
        16. Ulterior motives for principle witness to give false evidence ‘protect boyfriend – cohoused (?) – money’. 
         
         
        17. Evidence coerced from prosecution witness for favourable evidence and favour from police in relation to charges. 
         
         
        18. Admissibility of evidence (prejudicial to defence). 
         
         
        19. Weight of evidence prejudicial/probative value. 
         
         
        20. Editing of evidence ‘statements – letters – etc’ prejudicial to defence favourable to crown case ‘misleading’ and painting facts. 
         
         
        21. Admission of evidence irrelevant to case ‘no weight/probative value’. 
         
         
        22. Leading interviewing detective not giving evidence in cross-examination. 
         
         
        23. Misrepresentation of assisting legal aid solicitor. 
         
         
        24. Legal representation not acting as instructed. 
         
         
        25. Perjury of prosecution’s witness in cross. 
         
         
        26. Police coercion of prosecution witness. 
         
         
        27. Withholding evidence favourable to defence case. 
         
         
        28. Police misconduct on duty.” 
        
       
      
    6 A further document of four pages as submissions concluded with the statement of an intention to “lead evidence to the court of some 157 pages in support of my submissions plus provide evidence this case is fictitious”. In fulfilment of the intention, the appellant filed a document of 167 pages containing commentaries on a transcript of the audio tapes of the police interview with CD (the complete interview, not the edited interview in evidence at the trial), on CD’s oral evidence and on the Crown Prosecutor’s address to the jury, and an affidavit sworn by the appellant annexing over 600 pages of documentary material. The appellant sought to tender further documentary material, and to call oral evidence, at the hearing of the appeal.  
     
      
    7 The Crown contended that most of the affidavit material was not relevant, but was content that it be admitted with its objection being noted. The Court ruled on the other evidence on which the appellant wished to rely: the time this occupied showed that the Crown had taken a sound practical stance. The Crown briefly cross-examined the appellant.  
     
      
    8 The grounds of appeal included complaint that the appellant’s legal representation at the trial had been deficient. The appellant said that his grievance was only as to the solicitor, Mr David Imlah, not as to his counsel because counsel “was not properly informed”. After waiver of privilege, the Crown read an affidavit of Mr Imlah and Mr Imlah was cross-examined by the appellant.  
     
      
    9 I have sought to distil from the points in the grounds of appeal and the voluminous written and oral submissions and other materials before the Court the substance of the appellant’s complaints, and have addressed them in such detail as is appropriate.  
     
      
       
      Overview 
       
      
    10 A community youth service called Community Connections provided accommodation in premises in a country town for young people who were homeless or at risk of becoming homeless. There were two units in the premises. JN, aged 16, had lived in one of the units since April 2003 and NC, aged 19, began living in the unit in early August 2003. CD was JN’s girlfriend. She lived with her mother, but regularly stayed overnight in the unit.  
     
      
    11 On 11 August 2003 AE, aged 16, began living in the other unit. The appellant, aged 35, was AE’s boyfriend. On the appellant’s case he lived with his mother and visited AE frequently, but CD said that the appellant sometimes stayed at AE’s unit and JN said that the appellant moved into AE’s unit.  
     
      
    12 The three occupants of the units and CD and the appellant were often together in various combinations. Their gatherings included occasions of smoking cannabis and drinking alcohol. 
     
      
    13 On the Crown case, on one such occasion a few weeks after AE moved into the premises she, the appellant, JN and CD were together in AE’s unit, and there was discussion about sex and sexual activity which, omitting the detail, developed to a “foursome” in the course of which the appellant performed cunnilingus on CD (count 1) and then digitally penetrated her vagina (count 2). Still on the Crown case, some time between 20 and 24 September 2003 the appellant and CD walked to a nearby lookout where they had penile/vaginal intercourse (count 3), and on separate occasions on 24 September, 25 September and the morning of 26 September 2003 they had penile/vaginal intercourse (count 4), CD performed fellatio on the appellant (count 5), they had penile/vaginal intercourse (count 6), and CD performed fellatio on the appellant (count 7), in the bedroom or lounge room of AE’s unit. 
     
      
    14 On 25 September 2003 JN and NC went to Community Connections and told them “what was happening in the house”. They gave statements to the police. The statements were not in evidence: this generic description comes from JN’s evidence. The statements were before the Court on appeal. They were principally concerned with supply of prescription drugs by the appellant to the occupants of the units and in JN’s case also with the foursome. 
     
      
    15 On 26 September 2003 the appellant was arrested for drug offences. Following his arrest the police and a DOCS officer spoke to CD and AE, but they refused to be interviewed and CD was uncooperative and argumentative.  
     
      
    16 The appellant was interviewed in relation to the drug offences. At the end of the interview he was asked whether he had engaged in sexual acts with AE, JN and CD, and denied that he had.  
     
      
    17 The appellant was refused bail on the drug matters. While in prison he wrote several letters to CD which the Crown said supported, though non-specifically, that there had been a sexual relationship between the appellant and CD. 
     
      
    18 On 8 December 2003 CD signed at the local Legal Aid office an affidavit in which she said that she had seen statements of JN, NC and the appellant and had not taken part in or observed sexual acts referred to in those statements. In her evidence at the trial she said that she went to the Legal Aid office at the request of the appellant through AE, that she had not seen the appellant’s statement, that the affidavit was not true, and that she went to the Legal Aid office and signed the affidavit because she was in love with the appellant and would do anything for him.  
     
      
    19 On 30 December 2003 CD went to the police and gave a detailed interview complaining of the sexual acts the subject of the charges. When asked in cross-examination what had changed she said that AE had left, there was no one constantly telling her that the appellant was “so great”, and “so I finally came out of being brain washed and I finally realised the truth”. CD’s change of attitude, and exploring the reason(s) for it, was understandably prominent in the defence case. 
     
      
    20 The appellant was interviewed by the police on 2 March 2004. He denied the offences.  
     
      
       
      The trial 
       
      
    21 A trial commenced on 8 March 2005. Black DCJ ruled on the admissibility of certain evidence and a jury was empanelled, but it was discovered that there was an irregularity in the empanelment and the jury was discharged. A fresh jury was empanelled on 12 March 2005, and the parties agreed to be bound by the earlier rulings.  
     
      
    22 One ruling was concerned with evidence, to be given by CD, JN and NC, that the appellant provided prescription drugs (valium and prothiaden) to the occupants of the units. As I have said, the statements of JN and NC had been principally concerned with the supply of drugs to the occupants, and CD’s interview had included reference to it. The appellant had been charged with the summary offences of supply of restricted substances. The Crown proposed to lead evidence of smoking cannabis, drinking alcohol and taking the drugs supplied by the appellant “to put the relationship between the parties in some proper context”. The defence did not object to evidence of smoking cannabis and drinking alcohol, but objected to the further evidence, and the trial judge ruled against its admission. As one result, there was editing of the tapes of CD’s interview and of the interviews with the appellant, in addition to other editing of the tapes of the interviews on which the prosecution and defence agreed. When JN gave evidence the Crown did not elicit evidence of the drug-taking. 
     
      
    23 The other ruling was concerned with the letters written by the appellant to CD while in prison, to which the defence objected principally because on their face they were written while the appellant was in prison. The trial judge ruled in favour of their admission, while noting that it was agreed that there was to be editing. From what the Crown Prosecutor said, this was to be to remove their disclosure that the appellant “has spent a substantial part of his recent history in gaol”. 
     
      
    24 The trial ran to 23 March 2005. Evidence in the Crown case was given by CD and JN, by investigating police officers Detective Senior Constables Manitta and Williams, by CD’s mother, and by an officer of Community Connections. The jury was informed by agreement that NC could not give evidence by reason of a serious medical condition unconnected with the trial. The appellant gave evidence, and called evidence in his case from his mother and from the operator of a video store. 
     
      
    25 The evidence was lengthy, and the following is a less than full account but a sufficient framework for consideration of the appellant’s complaints. 
     
      
    26 CD initially gave evidence via CCTV (see Evidence (Children) Act, 1997(since repealed), s 18). She gave evidence of the interview with the police on 30 December 2003, and the edited audio tapes of the interview were played to the jury. Copies of a transcript were provided to the jurors. The tapes were in due course tendered and became an exhibit.  
     
      
    27 CD then gave further evidence in chief in the courtroom.  
     
      
    28 She identified and added some explanation of sketch plans of rooms in AE’s unit referred to in the interview, in the course of which she gave further evidence of the occasion of the foursome. She identified a number of letters written by the appellant over the period 14 October 2003 to 30 December 2003, and explained some of their contents (for example, that “Viking” was the appellant’s nickname and “baby girl” was what he called her). Copies of the letters, edited by agreement between the Crown and the defence, were tendered and became exhibits, further copies were provided to the jurors, and the edited letters were read aloud. She gave evidence that when the appellant was arrested on 26 September 2003 she “didn’t want to tell [the police] anything”, and that at the time her feelings towards the appellant were that she loved him and would do anything for him. She said that at the time of her interview on 30 December 2003 she “wanted someone else to tell me I was doing the right thing and I was still really confused”.  
     
      
    29 CD said that she had forgotten to include in the interview that on the occasion of the foursome the appellant had brought a pornographic DVD or DVDs which were played, and she gave some additional evidence also in relation to the later occasions of sexual intercourse. She was asked about going to the Legal Aid office on 8 December 2003, and gave evidence to the effect earlier mentioned. The trial judge granted a certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act 1995 in relation to her evidence of making a false affidavit. 
     
      
    30 If the jury accepted CD’s evidence of the sexual acts, they were entitled to find the appellant guilty of the charges. 
     
      
    31 CD was cross-examined at some length. The principal thrust of the cross-examination was that CD was making false allegations against the appellant in order to secure victim’s compensation, in conjunction with JN and also to restore her relationship with JN. She denied this, including denying that the police had raised or promised that she would get compensation. There was put to CD the change in her attitude to the appellant, particularly the change from making the affidavit in early December, her response being to the effect that she had been in love with the appellant and would have done anything for him but in late December 2003 that was no longer so. There were also put to her some discrepancies in the sequence of the acts of sexual intercourse and some uncertainties in their detail, for example whether on the occasion at the lookout she was on her back or her stomach, and other matters such as discrepancy in telling the police that the pornographic DVDs were videos. In the course of the cross-examination CD’s accounts of the sexual acts were gone over, in some respects in more detail than as she had described them in her evidence in chief. 
     
      
    32 CD had said in her interview that the appellant was circumcised and had his pubic hair shaved. The cross-examination included putting to CD that she had never seen the appellant naked, and further questions eliciting that she did not think he had any tattoos, denied that he had a penis ring and did not remember a birthmark or scar on his penis. 
     
      
    33 JN gave evidence of the occasion of the foursome. He said that soon thereafter, because he was worried for CD’s safety and health, he and NC went to Community Connections and “told them what was happening in the house”. He was taken to the police, where he made a statement; as I have said, the statement was not put in evidence. He and NC were moved to different accommodation. He saw CD from time to time thereafter, but CD was unfriendly towards him until around Christmas 2003 when she “was starting to want to talk”. Their relationship improved, and at the time of the trial he was living in CD’s household with her mother and sister. The trial judge granted JN a certificate under s 128 of the Evidence Act in relation to his evidence of his own participation in the foursome. 
     
      
    34 JN was particularly cross-examined to suggest the depth of the breakdown of his relationship with CD after 25 September 2003, it seems in order to emphasise that the later reconciliation was venal. He denied talking to CD about getting victim’s compensation, and denied that the police had said anything about compensation. 
     
      
    35 Detective Senior Constables Manitta and Williams variously gave evidence of taking statements from JN and NC on 25 September 2003, the arrest of the appellant on 26 September 2003 and the interview then conducted with him, of CD then being uncooperative and refusing to be interviewed, and of the interviews with CD on 30 December 2003 and with the appellant on 2 March 2004. The edited audio tape of the appellant’s interview of 26 September 2003, from which drug supplying had been removed and which was largely a description of relationships between the occupants of the units, was played to the jury; the concluding part in which the appellant denied that he had engaged in sexual acts had by mistake been edited out, and by agreement evidence of his denial was given orally. The audio tape of the interview of 2 March 2004 was played to the jury. Copies of transcripts were provided to the jury. The tapes were tendered and became exhibits.  
     
      
    36 Detective Senior Constable Manitta gave evidence of inquiries into the appellant’s membership of a video store club and obtaining a record of his hiring items on 2 September 2003, but the record did not enable the items to be identified. He said that the police had not promised money to CD for making her statement or spoken to her about compensation, save that after the appellant alleged in his interview of 2 March 2004 that CD had told people she was getting money he informally interviewed CD who assured him she had not. He said that in recent times the police had tried to take a statement from AE but received a “negative response”, and that she was no longer living in the area. 
     
      
    37 The cross-examination of the police officers touched briefly upon promise of victim’s compensation to CD, but did not obtain any support for CD having compensation in mind. It elicited that on an occasion when Detective Senior Constable Manitta had seen AE at CD’s home he had not asked her to make a statement; there was at least a toehold for failure sufficiently to try to obtain a statement. 
     
      
    38 CD’s mother gave evidence about CD staying out at night, and of seeing some bruising on her (CD had given evidence of bruising as a result of one of the sexual encounters). The mother had not met the appellant. She said that AE had come to stay with them but had moved out in early December 2003, and that from the end of December 2003 JN began to be CD’s girlfriend once more. The cross-examination elicited that when CD returned home a little after 26 September 2003 she told her mother that the appellant had done nothing wrong. 
     
      
    39 The officer of Community Connections gave evidence of the accommodation arrangements for the units, and of some dealings with the occupants and the appellant which did not take matters very far. She was not cross-examined. 
     
      
    40 The appellant’s evidence in chief was brief, and amounted to denial of any sexual activity with CD. He said of the DVDs that “I call them pornos”, but that there was no sex in them “just adult theme at the most, kissing, cuddling, then it would cut”. In relation to the foursome, he said that he would not want to be involved because “I’d never let anyone near [AE]”, and “I don’t even like people looking at her let alone touching her, I’m jealous, simple”. He described an occasion when NC had “started wierding out” and abused AE, something which had been part of his account of the relationships in the interview of 26 September 2003. He said that he had beaten NC up. 
     
      
    41 In his interview the appellant had said that he loved CD like a big brother. He said in his evidence that on an occasion CD “offered to have sex and I explained to her, look I don’t see her that way, its not how I see her … “. He agreed that there were sexual references in the letters he had written to CD, but explained that CD’s self-esteem was low and that she had “expressed an interest in me” and he “jokingly flirted with her a bit, probably not the right thing to do but I didn’t want to crush her … “.  
     
      
    42 The appellant said that CD had never seen him naked, and described a birthmark on his penis, a scar from where he had had a marble, and a piercing from a penis ring which he had worn “right until the time I was arrested”; that is, until 26 September 2003. He was not cross-examined in relation to this evidence. 
     
      
    43 In cross-examination the appellant agreed that CD told him she loved him, and wanted sex with him, but said that while he cared about her his feelings were not of a sexual nature and he was madly in love with AE. He was taken to the letters he had written while in prison, which it was suggested to him revealed a quite different relationship. Parts to which he was taken included writing about setting up a home with CD in Queensland, of which he had written “your mum will spin like a top if you fucked off with me, I’m working on it though”; expressing pride that CD and AE had “stuck together” and concern that he would be “in trouble” with AE when he got out of prison (which the Crown Prosecutor suggested reflected AE’s knowledge of the appellant having a sexual relationship with CD); and displaying jealousy that CD may have had a relationship with one Nathan. The appellant gave explanations, and it was for the jury to determine in the light of the cross-examination whether the letters supported a sexual relationship with CD or were no more than flirting so as not to be unkind in rebuffing her expressed love for him; it was, however, an effective cross-examination on material well open to the former view. 
     
      
    44 The appellant’s mother gave evidence concerning the appellant ordinarily staying at home and having AE as his girlfriend. The video store operator gave evidence concerning the hiring from the store. She could not tell whether the appellant had hired DVDs or videos, or identify the items. The store stocked R rated movies, in which “you know what’s going on but we don’t actually see the act itself in detail”, but not X rated. 
     
      
       
      The appellant’s complaints 
       
      
    45 The matters in the 28 point document can be brought under a number of topics. 
     
      
    46 The first is misconduct of the police, in coercing or inducing Crown witnesses to give evidence or to give favourable evidence and generally (points 7, 14, 17, 26 and 28). 
     
      
    47 The second is misconduct of the Crown, in withholding evidence, leading untrue and irrelevant evidence, misleadingly editing evidence and misinforming the jury (points 8, 10, 20, 22 and 27). 
     
      
    48 The third is in relation to the grant of certificates under s 128 of the Evidence Act (point 6).  
     
      
    49 The fourth is that of the appellant’s legal representatives failed to act upon instructions and otherwise acted deficiently (points 23 and 24). 
     
      
    50 The fifth is wrongful admission of evidence (points 18, 19 and 21).  
     
      
    51 The sixth and most comprehensive is, in summary, that the Crown case was not made out because of inconsistencies, contradictions and lack of credibility (points 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 and 25).  
     
      
    52 There were overlaps and variations within the grounds and submissions, and other matters appeared from the appellant’s written and oral submissions, but these topics provide a convenient framework. I will deal with variations and other matters in what follows. 
     
      
       
      Misconduct of the police 
       
      
    53 The appellant asserted that police had interfered with preparation of the defence case and intimidated defence witnesses and their families. There was no evidence to support this. Mr Imlah was not asked anything to suggest that his conduct of the defence case had been hindered. 
     
      
    54 Nor was there any evidence of inducement or coercion of Crown witnesses. The appellant may have meant that CD, or CD and JN, had been induced or coerced to give favourable evidence by suggestion or promise of victim’s compensation, as had been part of his case at the trial. His case at trial included the appellant’s assertion in his interview of 2 March 2004 that CD had been “coaxed by [JN] into the idea they’re going to get a victim’s compensation claim” and had it in her head they would get up to $50,000; it was put to CD, JN and the police officers, but without their acceptance. 
     
      
    55 The appellant may also have included in police misconduct his complaints in the written submissions that the police failed to obtain DNA at the units or to subject CD’s clothing to DNA testing in order to substantiate the allegations made against him, to subject CD to toxicological and sexual assault tests, or to take statements which would be unfavourable to the Crown case in September 2003. By unfavourable statements he appeared to mean statements from CD and AE to the effect that the sexual acts had not occurred.  
     
      
    56 For many reasons, these complaints have no substance. CD and AE refused to be interviewed, and it was not shown that the police could or should reasonably have done more in these respects. It was brought out at the trial that, in a solemn manner, in the affidavit made on 8 December 2003, CD denied the sexual acts. It is no more than speculative what DNA testing would have shown; there is no doubt that the appellant frequented the units, his DNA on CD’s clothing would not assist him and absence of his DNA on CD’s clothing would mean little.  
     
      
    57 Under this topic there may also be mentioned the appellant’s complaint that Detective Senior Constable Gargan did not give evidence; the complaint could also be seen as falling under misconduct of the Crown and failure in representation. Detective Senior Constable Gargan and Detective Senior Constable Manitta interviewed CD on 30 December 2003. Detective Senior Constable Gargan principally conducted the interview. From his submissions, the appellant considered that she had “led” CD or “fished for answers” in the account CD gave of the sexual acts, and that the Crown should have called Detective Senior Constable Gargan and Mr Imlah should have ensured that she was cross-examined to establish the leading. The transcript does not support leading, and no proper basis has been shown for challenging the conduct of the interview. Had there been one, Detective Senior Constable Manitta could have been cross-examined. This complaint also is without substance. 
     
      
       
      Misconduct of the Crown 
       
      
    58 In large part, on my understanding of the appellant’s submissions, his contention that there was misconduct of the Crown was because in his eyes the sexual acts did not take place. In one of the written submissions it was asserted that the Crown Prosecutor’s address to the jury “was misleading or prejudicial by stating facts untrue and stating facts as proven when this is simply not the facts [sic]”. He said orally that the “Crown’s summary”, meaning the Crown Prosecutor’s address, was “just a blatant manipulation of words and quoting things as facts that simply were not facts and the evidence clearly shows that”.  
     
      
    59 There is no basis for concluding that the Crown led evidence knowing it to be untrue, and having read the entirety of the evidence and addresses I do not see departure by the Crown Prosecutor from fair presentation of the Crown case. Any question of relevance of evidence was a matter for objection at the trial, if appropriate, and complaint which assumes that the evidence in the Crown case is untrue is misconceived.  
     
      
    60 Three particular matters can be seen in the appellant’s submissions. 
     
      
    61 The first is the editing of the interviews and the letters. It was undertaken in part by agreement and in part consequent on the trial judge’s ruling concerning evidence of drug-taking. As I later say in connection with failure in representation, the appellant’s legal representatives acted correctly in these respects. The ultimate editing was as agreed between the Crown and the defence, in the interests of the appellant as then seen and in my view as correctly seen. There was no misconduct by the Crown in participating in the editing; quite the reverse. 
     
      
    62 The second is a particular aspect of the appellant’s case that CD and JN were lying in order to obtain victim’s compensation. CD said in re-examination that compensation only came up when the police told her it had been alleged that they “paid me money for a statement” and that she “gave them a statement saying they didn’t give me any money”. (It will be recalled that the appellant had alleged in his interview of 2 March 2004 that CD had in her head getting $50,000, and that Detective Senior Constable Manitta said that he informally interviewed CD who denied she was getting money.) The appellant’s counsel called for the statement. The Crown Prosecutor said he had “no knowledge of it at the present time”. It was left that enquiries would be made. There was no further mention of the matter in the transcript. 
     
      
    63 In the appellant’s submission, the Crown Prosecutor had lied and the Crown had suppressed the statement. That should not be accepted. There was no evidence put before this Court about the existence or content of a statement. It is readily to be inferred, and I do, that the appellant’s legal representatives were provided with the statement and saw no advantage to the appellant in what CD said, or alternatively were satisfied that CD was in error in saying there was a statement and saw no advantage in taking that up as a matter going to her reliability. 
     
      
    64 The third is a complaint that the Crown Prosecutor misled the jury in relation to corroboration. It is not easy to understand the complaint. It was not necessary in law that CD’s evidence be corroborated. It was corroborated by the evidence of JN and possibly by the letters, but the Crown Prosecutor did not address the jury in terms of corroboration of her evidence. The appellant took issue with a reference by the Crown Prosecutor in his address to the appellant’s defence that “none of it happened” and it was “all a fantastic and elaborate lie on the part of [CD] and corroborated to the extent that [JN’s] account accords with hers by [JN]”. This was more a reference to the appellant’s case of collaboration between CD and JN in making false allegations against him, but as best I understand it in the appellant’s eyes it was misleading because JN was lying and so there was no corroboration. There is no substance in this complaint.  
     
      
       
      Certificates under s 128 of the Evidence Act 
       
      
    65 The grant of the certificates was not clearly taken up in the appellant’s submissions. From the submissions as a whole, he appears to have meant that the certificates granted to CD and JN were granted in the knowledge that the witnesses would otherwise perjure themselves because the evidence they were going to give was false. I think the appellant meant to submit that it was an inducement to give the false evidence.  
     
      
    66 This suggests a misunderstanding of the certificates. The certificates provided protection to the witnesses from use of their evidence in prosecutions for previous offending, in the case of CD making a false affidavit and in the case of JN his participation in the foursome and perhaps his own sexual relationship with CD. They did not provide protection against giving false evidence at the trial. The grant of the certificates was on application to the trial judge, in open court, and the trial judge was satisfied that the interests of justice required that the witnesses give their evidence. It is not an uncommon procedure, and there was nothing untoward in what occurred. In the circumstances it is quite understandable that the appellant’s legal representatives saw no occasion to suggest that the witnesses’ evidence was thereby tainted. 
     
      
       
      Failure in representation  
       
      
    67 This had some prominence in the appellant’s submissions. As I have said, the complaint was as to his representation by Mr Imlah, expressly not his representation by his counsel Mr Ian Polack, although in considering the complaint there can not be excluded Mr Polack’s part in the conduct of the defence case. 
     
      
    68 It was not easy to pin down the respects in which the appellant complained of failure in representation. Apart from the aspects relating to Detective Senior Constable Gargan, the principal respects appeared to be - 
     
      
      
      (a) dealing with the drug matters as part of the trial and editing the interviews;  
       
       
      (b) editing the letters; 
       
       
      (c) evidence from AE; 
       
       
      (d) evidence from NC; 
       
       
      (e) evidence from one John Gordon;  
       
       
      (f) evidence as to the features of the appellant’s penis. 
       
       
      (a) dealing with the drug matters as part of the trial and editing the interviews 
       
      
    69 The appellant had been charged with the supply of restricted substances. In one of the written submissions the appellant said -  
     
      
       
        
        “Why were the drug matters separated when the drug matters seemed to be the main alleged incident leading to the alleged offences? The drug matters were of importance to the defence case in proving that the Crown witnesses had in fact fabricated the allegations as documents would have proven and evidence of a pharmacist in relation to the amount and effects of said drugs consumed. I was never in agreement with this and raised my objections in the courtroom.” 
        
       
      
    70 In his oral submissions the appellant took this further. In summary, as best I understand it, his reasoning was that (i) in their statements given to the police on 26 September 2003 (which I have said were not before the jury) JN and NC had told of extensive supplying by the appellant of prescription drugs to the occupants of the units; (ii) the drugs and the quantities of which JN and NC spoke were such that what they said in their statements could not have been correct, because the quantities of the drugs would have left their consumers quite unable to function; (iii) this would have shown that JN’s evidence as to the foursome, and generally, was false; and (iv) his lawyers should have brought out before the jury the allegations of supplying drugs made by JN and NC and, through pharmacological or toxicological evidence, the extravagance of those allegations, in order to destroy JN’s credibility.  
     
      
    71 It followed, as was part of the submissions, that the appellant’s lawyers should not have opposed the Crown’s proposal to lead evidence of taking the drugs supplied by the appellant, and there should not have been the editing of the tapes of interviews to exclude reference to the drug-taking. In his evidence in this Court the appellant said that at the time he did not agree with his lawyers and argued with them, and “I wasn’t happy about the drugs being separated and I wanted it before the jury”. 
     
      
    72 Apparently as a related complaint, two paragraphs in the written submissions asked why a toxicology report was not carried out to establish that prescription medication prescribed to the appellant was in fact in CD’s system “as alleged in the statements of [NC] and [JN]”, and “why wasn’t there any medical report obtained on [CD] such as toxicology … test”. The appellant contended that drug-taking affected memory and that CD’s drug-taking should have been established in order to question her reliability. 
     
      
    73 Apart from the appellant’s denial that he had supplied drugs, there were obvious difficulties. 
     
      
    74 Mr Imlah said that his opinion, and that of counsel, was that it would not have assisted the appellant to show that CD was under the influence of a drug at any relevant time, and - 
     
      
       
        
        “The last thing we saw to be in the Appellant’s interest was to revisit the alleged facts that he may have assisted [CD] to obtain drugs. Further, it would only have been seen as a matter of aggravation if the Crown could show that 14-year old [CD] may have been under the influence of a drug at any time she had intercourse with the Appellant or that the Appellant had knowledge of this fact if it was proved.” 
        
       
      
    75 Similarly, it would have been wholly against the appellant’s interest to have exposed before the jury, in the hope that pharmacological or toxicological evidence would cut down the credibility of evidence to be given by JN and (as expected at the time) NC, extensive supplying of drugs by the appellant to the occupants of the units; there was every reason to fear that the appellant would be left under the heavy pall of supplying drugs to the teenagers. If it were mooted at the time, Mr Imlah (and Mr Polack) made a correct decision. 
     
      
    76 The correctness of the course taken by Mr Imlah and counsel is compelling. There was no evidence that they disobeyed direct instructions in taking it. A letter from Mr Imlah in the materials put by the appellant before the Court said of “the edited record of interview dated 26.10.2005” that “it was decided by us all at trial that there would be no objection to the edited ROI as in fact it seemed to assist your case if anything”. From another letter, the ROI was the appellant’s interview of 26 September 2003 and the editing was to remove “questions concerning the supply of restricted substances namely prothiaden and valium”. The likelihood is that at the time the appellant agreed. 
     
      
       
      (b) editing the letters 
       
      
    77 The letters were edited to remove reference to a history of incarceration, and from the appellant’s evidence in this court to remove references to him “being a standover person, being a racist, hating niggers”. The appellant said that he understood why there had to be editing “but I wanted the full picture before the jury. I didn’t want the jury wondering”. It is sufficient to say that his lawyers’ participation in the editing was a rational course, in the appellant’s interest. 
     
      
    78 As a related matter, it appears that the appellant’s complaints included failure to tender in his case letters written to him by CD while he was in prison in the latter part of 2003. The appellant’s counsel cross-examined CD on the letters, taking her to some parts of them. The Crown called for the letters, the appellant’s counsel objected to making them available, and the trial judge ruled that they need not be made available. It was not explained why the use of the letters in this way was to the appellant’s disadvantage rather than to his advantage. There is no substance in the complaint. 
     
      
       
      (c) evidence from AE 
       
      
    79 Mr Imlah had file notes as at 14 February 2005, a few weeks before the trial, that AE had left her last known address and that the mobile number he had was telephoned without success. He said that he and counsel were both of the view that, even if AE could be located, to call her as a witness would not have been desirable because it would have disclosed a sexual relationship between the 35 year old appellant and the 16 year old AE, with implications for a relationship with the 14 year old CD. He said as well that immediately prior to the trial the appellant said “that he had an ambivalent or estranged relationship with [AE] and that she may not be favourable to his case”.  
     
      
    80 It was not suggested what more Mr Imlah should have done to try to find AE, and even if she could have been found in what way it was a rational forensic decision that she should be called. When she was not called by the Crown, the appellant’s counsel sought to cast doubt on the Crown’s diligence in taking a statement from AE, and in his address to the jury observed that “[t]he last we hear of [AE] is of her signing an affidavit at the Legal Aid office in December before returning to Sydney”. It was an understandable course to leave a suggestion that the Crown case was wanting because the Crown had not called AE.  
     
      
       
      (d) evidence from NC 
       
      
    81 The Crown had given notice that it intended to call NC. When it first emerged that NC might not be able to give evidence because of a medical condition, Mr Polack informed the trial judge that he wanted NC called. There came medical opinion that NC could not foreseeably give evidence. In the result, the jury was informed as I have earlier described. 
     
      
    82 In the course of his submissions the appellant said a number of times that he wanted to have NC called and cross-examined. As best I understand it, his present reasoning was that JN and CD in collaboration made false allegations of sexual misconduct so that the appellant would be kept in gaol, wanting the appellant to be kept in gaol because it was feared that the appellant would do someone physical injury. The occasion for the fear was that NC was a disturbed person prone to violent behaviour, and in particular on about 24 September 2003 had “skitzed out” and behaved badly towards AE bringing about a physical confrontation with the appellant. The fear seemed to be of physical injury to JN, although at times the motive attributed by the appellant to CD was fear that the appellant would do harm to AE; why the confrontation with NC meant that the appellant might harm JN or AE was not particularly clear. In the appellant’s eyes, it was important that NC’s disturbed and violent nature and the occasion of his “skitzing out” be established. 
     
      
    83 CD’s interview included an account of NC going “off his head” on the night of 24 September 2003, and she gave evidence that AE had sought to take out an AVO against him. I have referred to the appellant saying that he had beaten NC up. JN gave evidence in chief of an incident between NC and AE, including the appellant saying to NC “Ah, I’ll smash you”, and elaborated in cross-examination. The appellant’s interview included his assertion that CD “buckled under pressure”, implicitly from JN, from belief that the appellant would harm JN. Even without evidence from NC, there was a basis for the appellant’s present reasoning. But CD’s cross-examination did not include putting to her that fear of the appellant doing physical injury to JN, or to AE or herself, caused her to make false allegations of sexual misconduct. Nor was that put to JN.  
     
      
    84 Had counsel wished to pursue the reasoning I have attempted to describe, he could have done so without evidence from NC. He did not pursue it. Counsel said bluntly, when NC’s unavailability was confirmed, that “[t]he defence wants the trial to continue”. This also was a rational forensic decision.  
     
      
       
      (e) evidence from John Gordon 
       
      
    85 Mr Gordon was a prisoner in the same gaol as the appellant. The appellant told Mr Imlah that Mr Gordon would give evidence to support that the appellant was being “set up” by CD and JN in order to obtain victim’s compensation. In November 2004 Mr Imlah and Mr Polack’s predecessor as counsel interviewed Mr Gordon. The materials put before the Court by the appellant included what appeared to be notes of that conference, difficult to read but possibly recording that Mr Gordon said that CD had told him “we’re setting this bloke up for drugs. So we get money from coppers”. 
     
      
    86 According to Mr Imlah, however, it emerged that what he described as Mr Gordon’s “limited recollection” was largely based on what the appellant had told him. He advised the appellant that Mr Gordon would not assist his case and should not be called, as he would not be found credible. There is no proper basis for contesting the validity of that advice, or doubting that it was accepted at the time. 
     
      
    87 As a related matter, Mr Imlah said in his affidavit that another person, in his oral evidence identified as the Nathan earlier mentioned, arrived at court during the trial prepared to give similar evidence derived from conversations with the appellant. Mr Imlah said that the person “also indicated that the Appellant had made a certain admission to him that would irreparably damage the accused’s case”. Nathan was not called. Although the appellant did not appear to rely on failure to call him, the position is the same. 
     
      
       
      (f) evidence as to the features of the appellant’s penis 
       
      
    88 Mr Imlah accepted that the appellant consistently instructed that his penis at the time was highly unusual in appearance, and that this should have been noticed by CD. He explained bureaucratic difficulties in arranging a medical examination of the appellant’s penis, and that an examination was eventually carried out by Dr Brian Witt on 17 March 2005. That was the day on which CD concluded her evidence.  
     
      
    89 According to Dr Witt’s report of that date, there was a slightly darker area which the appellant called a birth mark, although one difficult to see, and a transverse scar, but he would “not have viewed these areas as noticeably abnormal”. Under the ventral aspect of the penis there was a transverse piercing of an approximately 12 mm long bar with approximately 3 mm diameter white plastic balls on either end. It was removable, and he was told by the appellant that the appellant had previously had a gold stud in that location.  
     
      
    90 The asserted features of the appellant’s penis were put to CD. The appellant gave evidence of the features, and as I have said he was not cross-examined. Mr Imlah said that he and counsel considered that the appellant’s case was not assisted greatly by the evidence from Dr Witt, as there was no way of definitely proving that the appellant was wearing the gold stud at the time.  
     
      
    91 There was no evidence of whether or not specific instructions were sought after Dr Witt’s report was obtained, or whether at the time the appellant agreed with Mr Imlah and counsel. There may have been a degree of advantage to the defence case, even if it could not be shown (otherwise than by the appellant’s evidence) that he was wearing the gold stud at the time, but it was not clear how noticeable the piercing would have been without the bar or stud at the time of the sexual acts. Ultimately it was for the jury to assess the divergence between CD’s evidence and the appellant’s evidence of the features of his penis, as part of their overall attention to whether the offences had been proved beyond reasonable doubt. In my opinion, it was open to Mr Imlah and counsel to decide, as one of the decisions upon what evidence to call falling within their conduct of the defence case, that evidence should not be called from Dr Witt. 
     
      
    92 The materials put before the Court by the appellant included a doctor’s report of an examination for “body identifying marks” made in December 2007. It referred to scars and piercing on the penis. It took matters no further than Dr Witt’s report. 
     
      
    93 The appellant said that he also complained on appeal that Mark Reynolds and Gary McKennet were not called. Mr Reynolds, he said, could confirm that he used to walk from the premises to his home. Mr McKennett claimed that JN had a claim for sexual assault against a third person. If the lawyers were made aware of these potential witnesses, they were entitled to regard their evidence as of little if any importance and decide that they should not be called. 
     
      
    94 Inadequate representation must give rise to a miscarriage of justice within s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. For discussion of when the conduct of the defence case by a legal representative gives rise to a miscarriage of justice, reference may be made to TKWJ v The Queen [2002] HCA 46; (2002) 212 CLR 124; Ali v The Queen [2005] HCA 8; (2005) 214 ALR 1; and Rudd v The Queen [2006] HCA 9; (2006) 225 ALR 161. The legal representative has a wide discretion in the conduct of the case, and must routinely make tactical decisions as to what evidence to object to, what evidence to call, and in other respects. The party represented is bound by those decisions. A rational decision, even if later regretted, will not make a trial unfair or produce a miscarriage of justice, and what must be shown is loss of a chance of acquittal which was fairly open to the accused. 
     
      
    95 In my opinion, individually or collectively the matters to which I have referred did not give rise to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
       
      Wrongful admission of evidence 
       
      
    96 It is not clear from the appellant’s submissions what evidence he had in mind. The only ruling of significance was in relation to the letters written by the appellant to CD while in prison, and one of the written submissions included - 
     
      
       
        
        “Argument that letters from me to alleged victim in evidence (prejudicial value exceeds probative value) the letters shows no suggestion of a sexual relationship – only a close relationship and concern.”  
        
       
      
    97 As I have earlier indicated, the principal unfair prejudice on which the appellant relied before the trial judge was that on their face the letters were written while the appellant was in prison. The trial judge ruled that they were “on one reading capable of supporting the Crown case” but “[g]iven another reading it will be said that they do not show anything more than concern for her welfare”, and that that prejudice could be dealt with by directions to the jury concerning the appellant’s bail situation and “the fact that a person is in custody does not in any way prove that he committed these offences with which he is charged”. His Honour said he understood that the “other prejudicial matters”, unspecified, were to be addressed by editing, and that he would deal with any disagreement if it arose. He was not called on to do so.  
     
      
    98 The Crown Prosecutor’s opening referred to the appellant’s arrest on 26 September 2003 and that he was charged with offences, and in general terms the Crown added that - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … you’ll hear evidence that after Mr McCarthy had been arrested and first interviewed by the police, he was arrested and put before the Court and a magistrate refused him bail. The Crown asks you not to draw any adverse inferences from that. It’s a matter that happens all the time but it puts in context those letters where it’s clear that by that stage, and I’m talking now about October and early November 2003, that correspondence is in the context of [CD] and the accused being physically separated, he clearly harbouring continuing affection towards her and you’ll hear evidence from [CD] that at that stage she was still certainly harbouring some continuing affection towards the accused but was in a state of some confusion.” 
        
       
      
    99 At the end of that day the trial judge said - 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Now members of the jury before we break up there are two or three things I have to say to you. First of all you will remember that in his opening address the Crown Prosecutor told you that the accused had had some difficulties with bail and you would have gathered from these letters that some of them, at any rate, were written after he was arrested in October [sic]. Now you are correctly told that that has got nothing to do with proving this case, all sorts of reasons why people might have problems with bail at one time or another, there is a long and complex act about bail and a moment’s reflection will show you that there is no way in the world that problems with bail could prove whether or not he committed any of these offences, that is a matter for the evidence that you have just started hearing. So the problems with bail you are aware of them, put them out of your mind and certainly do not hold them against the accused.” 
        
       
      
    100 The trial judge did not in the summing-up give any specific directions in relation to the letters, nor when invited in the conventional manner did counsel ask that he do so.  
     
      
    101 All concerned appear to have accepted that any risk of unfair prejudice had been appropriately dealt with. The appellant’s submission assumed an innocuous reading of the letters. How were they to be read was ultimately a matter for the jury, but they were clearly open to a reading probative in the Crown case and such risk of unfair prejudice as there was was comprehensively outweighed by the probative value of the letters. There was no error in the trial judge’s ruling, or in the manner in which the letters were thereafter dealt with. 
     
      
       
      Making out the Crown case 
       
      
    102 The legal guise of the various points put forward as grounds of appeal is that the verdicts of the jury should be set aside on the ground that “they are unreasonable or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence”: Criminal Appeal Act s 6(1). 
     
      
    103 The Crown Prosecutor in his address to the jury said that CD was “the principal prosecution witness”, and that if the jury was left in a real doubt in relation to her evidence the charges failed. Counsel for the appellant, in similar vein, began his address by saying, “We say you can’t trust what [CD] says so basically the other evidence is the evidence in the letters [sic] … don’t show that there’s a sexual relationship between the accused and [CD]”. 
     
      
    104 The trial judge appropriately directed the jury upon the burden of proof and the necessity for proof beyond reasonable doubt. His Honour’s directions emphasised that it was necessary that the jury accept CD’s evidence - 
     
      
       
        
        “Now the next thing I direct you about is that in this case there is, in essence, one witness who is essential to the proof of the Crown case, and that is the witness [CD], and you should therefore examine and scrutinise her evidence with great care before you decide whether you accept her evidence. 
        
       
       
        
        Since it is for the Crown to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, and the evidence given by that witness is the only evidence relating to some of the essential matters that the Crown must prove, then it follows that you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that you should accept her evidence otherwise the accused must be found not guilty.” 
        
       
      
    105 The jury was further directed that it was for the Crown to establish that CD “is honest and reliable in giving her evidence supportive of its case, it is not for the accused to show that she was either dishonest or unreliable”, and that “[a]s the case turns on the evidence of CD you have got to be satisfied, beyond reasonable doubt that CD has told the truth”.  
     
      
    106 There were many facets in the evidence, and the addresses were fairly wide-ranging. The appellant’s counsel properly brought out and relied upon the particular features of discrepancies in CD’s evidence and the denial of any sexual misconduct in the affidavit signed at the Legal Aid office, and put to the jury a variety of reasons for doubting the evidence of CD. On the other hand, CD’s evidence of the foursome was supported by the evidence of JN, albeit that he professed a less than complete recollection, and that there had been a sexual relationship was supported by the letters written by the appellant to CD while in prison; it is difficult to read the letters as no more than flirting with CD lest her expressed love for the appellant be unkindly rebuffed.  
     
      
    107 The appellant asserted at various times in the course of his submissions that witnesses in the Crown case had perjured themselves. In part his submissions were concerned with perjury in relation to the certificates under s 128 of the Evidence Act, to which I have earlier referred. There was no further or fresh evidence before this Court establishing perjury, and the appellant’s assertions were submissions as to where the truth lay.  
     
      
    108 The question on appeal is whether on the whole of the evidence it was established beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty, see the discussion in M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 493-495. If the Court on appeal were to consider that there is a reasonable doubt, it is likely to be a doubt that a jury ought also to have experienced: M v The Queen at 494; MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at [56]. 
     
      
    109 If there be doubt in the mind of the appellate court, it is only where the jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence can explain the difference that the appellate court is able to reach the conclusion that there has been no miscarriage of justice: M v The Queen at 494; MFA v The Queen at [56]. On the evidence in this trial, there is no reasonable doubt raised, and it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the truth lay in the evidence of the sexual acts given by CD. 
     
      
       
      Other matters 
       
       
      (a) jury notes 
       
      
    110 The appellant referred in the material exhibited to his affidavit, and raised in his oral submissions, some notes received from the jury.  
     
      
    111 On 14 March 2005, shortly after CD was called to give evidence, and in the absence of the jury while arrangements were being made for the tapes of her interview to be played, the trial judge said - 
     
      
       
        
        “Now its just been brought to my attention that one of the jurors is a work colleague of the witness support officer, sorry of a sexual assault counsellor. Now I don’t know whether this lady was involved in this case, the name that we’ve been given is Bronwyn Myers”. 
        
       
      
    112 It is not clear how the trial judge came to know of this, and if there was a note from the juror it was not marked for identification.  
     
      
    113 The Crown Prosecutor said that Ms Myers had been “the support person present during the police interview”, being the interview with CD on 30 December 2003. She was referred to as such on the tapes, although they were yet to be played. The trial judge invited counsel for the appellant to “consider your position over lunch and discuss it with your client”.  
     
      
    114 After the luncheon adjournment the appellant’s counsel asked the trial judge to “inquire further as to whether the juror had any knowledge of this matter when it occurred and had any discussion with Bronwyn Miles [sic] about, about the case.” The Crown Prosecutor agreed that that would be a proper course.  
     
      
    115 The juror came into court. The transcript of her answers to the trial judge’s enquiries is incomplete, with “no microphone” and “not transcribable” in parentheses on a number of occasions, but what is recorded clearly conveys that the juror had not seen Ms Myers for four or five years and had not had any discussion of the case with her.  
     
      
    116 The trial judge asked the Crown Prosecutor and counsel for the accused whether there was anything else they felt should be asked, and both replied in the negative. The juror returned to the jury room. His Honour asked counsel for the appellant whether he wished to take instructions, and counsel said that he had “taken visual instructions and there’s not a problem your Honour”. The trial continued, and no more was said. 
     
      
    117 The appellant said that any visual instructions were not taken from him. It is plain that the appellant was present in court, and I do not accept that he was unaware of what occurred. In my opinion, there is no basis for complaint of the manner of dealing with the juror’s association with Ms Myers.  
     
      
    118 On 15 March 2005, the second day of the trial, a note was received from a juror stating that because of a job he had held at a boarding-house - 
     
      
       
        
        “ … theres [sic] a very good chance I might know some witnesses especially one bloke mentioned in statement as JN not sure of his surname. It doesn’t bother me at all but I thought I better mention it.” 
        
       
      
    119 The note was later marked as MFI 1. JN had been referred to in the Crown Prosecutor’s opening. 
     
      
    120 The transcript records the appellant’s counsel saying that the note “doesn’t cause me a problem”, and his implicit assent to the trial judge’s proposal that the jury be told “if it becomes a problem for him he must let us know”. His Honour told the jury - 
     
      
       
        
        “The author of the note says that they’re not bothered at this time, you may take it nor is anybody else at this time. If it becomes a bother, no doubt the author of the note will let us know further, thank you very much.” 
        
       
      
    121 The appellant’s complaint was expressed, “Why wasn’t I told?” The appellant must have been in court at the time, and there is nothing in the transcript to indicate that he was not. It may be that his counsel did not specifically seek instructions on the juror’s note, but it was a matter which counsel could deal with as one of the many decisions to be made in the conduct of the defence. All must have understood that “becoming a problem” or “becoming a bother” meant that the juror realised, when he saw a witness, that he did know the witness. Counsel was content to leave matters as they were until, if that happened, the juror let the trial judge know. I do not think that was an incorrect course. 
     
      
    122 At the close of the Crown case another note was received from the jury, reading - 
     
      
       
        
        “I played touch football with Tony O’Brien approx 3 years ago but have had no contact with him since then.” 
        
       
      
    123 The note was marked as MFI 4. The transcript records - 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: Did you both see the note from the jury? 
        
       
       
        
        POLAK; I did, I don’t think it’s --- 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Any problem for anyone. 
        
       
       
        
        POLAK: No, your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No, your Honour.” 
        
       
      
    124 In the evidence of Detective Senior Constable Williams given shortly before receipt of the note, Mr Tony O’Brien had been named as the DOCS officer with her when she spoke to CD and AE on 26 September 2003. As earlier mentioned, CD refused to be interviewed and was uncooperative and argumentative.  
     
      
    125 In his submissions the appellant said of this, as of the two previous notes, that the juror was “associated with the Crown”. This is hardly correct by reason of playing touch football with Mr O’Brien, but the juror’s contact with Mr O’Brien had ceased over 18 months prior to September 2003 and provided no basis for concern that the juror would not be true to the juror’s oath. The information conveyed by the note was appropriately dealt with. 
     
      
    126 There was no miscarriage of justice in the manner of dealing with the notes from the jury. 
     
      
       
      (b) Mr van Dugteren and the affidavit made at the Legal Aid office 
       
      
    127 The materials put before the court by the appellant included a copy of an affidavit affirmed by Mr Hugh van Dugteren on 26 May 2008. Mr van Dugteren had been a legal aid officer, and CD’s affidavit of 8 December 2003 had been made before him. He said in his affidavit that he had a “vague recollection” of the attendance, and that he did not “place any pressure on” either CD or AE to make their affidavits.  
     
      
    128 Assuming this was intended as further evidence on appeal, it is of minimal, if any, significance, and should not be received as further evidence. 
     
      
       
      (c) the jury retiring with the tapes of CD’s interview 
       
      
    129 The Crown drew attention to the decision of this Court in R v NZ [2005] NSWCCA 278; (2005) 63 NSWLR 628. The decision was given some months after the appellant’s trial had concluded.  
     
      
    130 It was held in R v NZ that, while there was not a rule of practice or procedure to be followed in every case where the evidence in chief of a witness had been given by the playing of a video tape, generally the video tape evidence should not become an exhibit and therefore be sent with the exhibits to the jury on retirement; and further, that any transcript given to the jury should be recovered after the evidence of the witness had been completed (at [210] per Howie and Johnson JJ). However, it was also held that, apart from whether lack of objection meant that r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules applied, in the particular circumstances (which were identified at some length) it could not be concluded that the trial was “unbalanced by the presence of that material in the jury room” (at [221]) and there was not a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
    131 In Wilson v R [2006] NSWCCA 217 it was also held that, in the particular circumstances, departure from the preferred procedure referred to in R v NZ had not given rise to a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    132 In the present case the jury retired with the tapes of CD’s interview of 30 December 2003 and of the appellant’s interviews of 26 September 2003 and 2 March 2004. The jury were provided with transcripts. They were properly instructed that the transcripts were an aid but not evidence and the tapes were the evidence, but no doubt they retired with the transcripts also. 
     
      
    133 When the preferred procedure referred to in R v NZ has not been followed, the question is whether there has been a miscarriage of justice. The central reason for the preferred course is that re-playing of the video tape of the evidence in chief could cause the jury to place an undue weight on the witness’ evidence or otherwise bring about an imbalance in their consideration of the respective cases.  
     
      
    134 In the present case, and putting aside r 4, I am satisfied for a number of reasons that no miscarriage of justice occurred.  
     
      
    · The jury retired at 12.45 pm on 22 March 2005 and considered their verdicts until 4.10 pm, resumed on the next day at 9.32 am, and returned the verdicts at 10.30 am. The tapes of CD’s interview are approximately 2 hours in length. The jury had a considerable amount of material for consideration, and I think it unlikely that they would have played the tapes given the relatively short time for which they were deliberating.  
     
      
    · We have listened to excerpts from the tapes, in order to assess how they might have been regarded by the jury. The sound quality is very poor, and in my opinion it becomes highly unlikely that in the course of their deliberations the jury would have played the tapes. 
     
      
    · Even if the jury had played the tapes, they were audio tapes not video tapes. CD’s responses to the interviewer’s questions were flat and unemotional. There would not have been an undue impact on the jury from listening to the tapes. 
     
      
    · The jury may have had reference to the transcript of the tapes, but they also had the transcripts of the tapes of the appellant’s interviews. The transcripts provided words on pages, without differential impact on presentation. 
     
      
    · CD had given further evidence in chief, and had been cross-examined over a lengthy period. Her cross-examination had in substance canvassed her accounts of the sexual acts. This was far more likely to provide the lasting and significant impression on the jury. The jury had every opportunity to assess her credibility from observation, not from the tapes or the transcript. 
     
      
    135 I do not think that CD’s evidence given through the audio tapes would be unduly prominent in the jury’s minds through retirement with the tapes and transcript.  
     
      
       
      General 
       
      
    136 There was repetition and irrelevance in the appellant’s written and oral presentation of his case on appeal. Some of the matters considered in these reasons might be thought of little consequence; much else of what the appellant appeared to regard as significant was inconsequential or founded on an untenable appreciation, or lack of appreciation, of the need to show a miscarriage of justice. Sometimes it defied rationality. I have considered all that the appellant put before the Court. In my opinion, a ground or grounds of appeal whereby there was a miscarriage of justice have not been established. 
     
      
    137 I propose that the time for appealing be extended to 17 August 2006 but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    138 ROTHMAN J: I agree with Giles JA. 
     
      
    139 PRICE J: I agree with Giles JA.

     Headnote 
     
     
      
    The appellant, DTS, was found guilty of the offence of aggravated indecent assault contrary to the provisions of s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, being count 1 on the indictment laid against him. Sorby DCJ sentenced the appellant to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    The particulars charged in the indictment were that the appellant assaulted the complainant and at the time committed an act of indecency upon her, namely, he touched her breast in circumstances of aggravation, namely, at the time of the offence, the complainant was under the age of 16 years, namely, 12 years of age. The complainant gave evidence that the appellant moved to sit between the complainant and her friend, and put his arms around them both. The complainant’s friend substantially confirmed this evidence, albeit with some inconsistencies. However, the friend did not witness the appellant touch and squeeze the complainant’s breast and refer to its size. The Crown had also adduced relationship evidence in respect of count 1, namely, conduct of a sexual nature that the appellant had exhibited towards the complainant over some years. 
     
      
    The appellant had also been charged with assault with intent to have sexual intercourse without consent contrary to the provisions of s 66D of the Crimes Act: count 2; and a further offence of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M of the Crimes Act: count 3. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on count 2 and was not able to reach a verdict on count 3.The trial judge had given a Murray direction to the jury in respect of counts 2 and 3, that only after careful scrutiny and evaluation of the complainant’s evidence, and being satisfied of its truth, could the jury use the evidence as a basis for conviction. The trial judge added that the warning was not given because his Honour had a view about the evidence, but because the law required him to do so. 
     
      
    The appellant made three complaints about his Honour’s Murray direction to the jury. First, that a Murray direction should have also been given in respect of count 1. Secondly, that the failure to give a direction in respect of count 1 may have confused the jury, in circumstances where the Crown case depended almost entirely upon the evidence of the complainant. Thirdly, that his Honour erred in informing the jury that the direction was required at law, and not because of any view about the evidence held by the trial judge. Finally, the appellant submitted that the jury should have been directed that the relationship evidence needed to be proven beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    Did the trial judge err in failing to give a Murray direction in respect of count 1?1. The purpose of a Murray direction is to ensure a fair trial and to avoid a miscarriage of justice: [41].

    4. It was open to a jury to regard the inconsistencies as not being crucial, and to accept the more critical aspects of the evidence: [42].5. The appellant’s solicitor, in his address to the jury, identified the discrepancies in the evidence. It was not necessary for the trial judge to repeat those matters, or give a Murray direction in the circumstances of the case: [43].Would the jury have been confused by the failure to give a Murray direction? 
    6. The case against the appellant on count 1 was not strictly a case of ‘word on word’. In these circumstances, the trial judge was entitled to determine that no direction was required: [45]. 
    7. Although the evidence of the complainant’s friend fell short of full corroboration, her account did significantly support the complainant’s version of events: [45].Did the trial judge err in giving in general terms a Murray direction?8. (Obiter) Where a Murray direction is given, it should be related to the circumstances of the case: [46].

    9. (Obiter) Had a Murray direction been in issue, there may have been a real question as to whether the trial judge erred in the caveat he gave, namely, that the warning was given as a matter of law: [48]

     [1989] HCA 60; (1989) 168 CLR 79 (considered). 
    Did the jury need to be directed that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the acts advanced by way of relationship evidence?10. Where the evidence was adduced as relationship evidence, not tendency evidence, such evidence does not require a direction that it be proved beyond reasonable doubt: [55].

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: On 14 February 2007, the appellant was found guilty of the offence of aggravated indecent assault contrary to the provisions of s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, being count 1 on the indictment laid against him. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty on count 2 on the indictment, which had charged assault with intent to have sexual intercourse without consent contrary to the provisions of s 66D of the Crimes Act. The jury was not able to reach a verdict on count 3, which was laid alternatively to count 2, of a further offence of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M of the Crimes Act.  
     
      
    2 An offence under s 61M(1) carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    3 On 8 August 2008, Sorby DCJ sentenced the appellant to be of good behaviour for a period of 12 months pursuant to s 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999.  
     
      
    4 The particulars charged in the indictment in respect of count 1 were that between 6 June and 11 June 1991, at Yass, the appellant assaulted the complainant and at the time committed an act of indecency upon her, namely, he touched her breast in circumstances of aggravation, namely, at the time of the offence, the complainant was under the age of 16 years, namely, 12 years of age.  
     
      
    5 The complainant lived with her parents on a country property. The appellant was a family friend and his daughter was married to the complainant’s uncle. The appellant was the manager of a business which was conducted out of factory premises at Mortdale. The appellant lived in a flat underneath those premises. The appellant was a regular visitor to the country property where the complainant lived. 
     
      
    6 The appellant was visiting the complainant’s family at the property over the Queen’s Birthday long weekend in 1991. There was a bonfire and the complainant and a friend had been seated on the ground. The appellant moved to sit between the complainant and her friend and put his arms around them both. With his right hand, he touched and squeezed the complainant’s breast and referred to its size.  
     
      
       
      Count 1 
       
      
    7 The Crown adduced relationship evidence in respect of count 1, conveniently summarised by the Crown in terms not contested by the appellant, as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) When the complainant was aged about 11 years, during a visit by the appellant to Yass, the appellant poked his tongue in her ear while she was sitting on his lap at the dining table, with other children and adults around; 
       
       
      (b) When the complainant was aged about 11 years, during a visit to Yass the appellant placed his hand on the complainant’s bottom while she was wearing a swimming costume near the swimming pool; 
       
       
      (c) Nearly every time he visited Yass, the appellant touched the complainant on the bottom, making “ 
      gross comments 
      ” that he would not make around adults, that is, about her physical and sexual development and her breasts, and would ask her whether she was wearing a bra, had started to kiss boys and whether she had “ 
      given boys head 
      ”; 
       
       
      (d) When the complainant was aged 12 years and living in the smaller house on her parents’ property, on the verandah, the appellant showed her a pornographic magazine; he obtained another magazine, read her a story about a girl’s first sexual experience and, when she walked away, followed her and continued to read the story until he had finished it; 
       
       
      (e) When she was aged about 12 years, in the garage at her sister’s house, the appellant gave the complainant and her sister alcohol, making her drunk and very sick. 
       
      
    8 Although the appellant was acquitted on count 2 and the jury did not agree upon a verdict in respect of count 3, the facts of those offences are relevant to the principal issue raised on the appeal, which was whether a Murray direction ought to have been given in respect of count 1: R v Murray (1987) 11 NSWLR 12; (1987) 30 A Crim R 315. The particulars of count 2 and 3 were as follows: 
     
      
       
      Count 2: the s 66D offence 
       
       
        
        “That between 31 December 1993 and 16 February 1994 at Mortdale [the appellant] assaulted [the complainant] with intent to have sexual intercourse with [her], a person then above the age of 10 years and under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years of age”  
        
       
       
      Count 3: the second s 61M(1) offence 
       
       
        
        “That between 31 December 1993 and 16 February 1994 at Mortdale [the appellant] assaulted [the complainant] and at the time committed an act of indecency upon her, namely he attempted to remove her shorts in circumstances of aggravation, namely that at the time of the offence she was under the age of 16 years, namely 15 years of age”  
        
       
      
    9 The facts alleged in respect of counts 2 and 3 were as follows. In January 1994, the complainant was in Sydney and participated in a fishing tournament on 22 and 23 January. The day after the tournament, that is, 24 January, the appellant had lunch with the complainant in the flat underneath the factory premises at Mortdale when, having undone his belt, he chased the complainant around the table, grabbed her and when she fell, pushed her onto her back and pinned her down by her arms. The appellant then tried to undo the complainant’s shorts and pull them off. The complainant struggled and said “Don’t” and “No” more than once. The complainant was eventually successful in resisting the appellant. The complainant alleged her hands were bleeding from holding on so tightly. The complainant made arrangements to leave the next day and travelled home by train alone.  
     
      
    10 Relationship evidence was also called in relation to counts 2 and 3.  
     
      
    11 The trial judge gave a Murray direction in respect of counts 2 and 3 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The next direction of law that I give you, members of the jury, relates to counts two and three on the indictment. The evidence of [the complainant] was that at the time of the alleged acts by [the appellant] it was just her and [the appellant] who were present in the downstairs flat. Members of the jury, before you can convict [the appellant] on the evidence of the one witness you must carefully scrutinise and evaluate that evidence in the light of the criticisms made of it by counsel for [the appellant] in regard to each of those two counts. It is only after such careful scrutiny and evaluation and if you are satisfied that the evidence is truthful, reliable and accurate that you can use the evidence as a basis for conviction of the two charges, counts two and three alleged in the indictment. I give you this direction because the case against [the appellant] rests almost entirely on the evidence of [the complainant] and when that is the position the direction I have to give you is one that I always give to a jury. The warning is not given because I have a view about the evidence. I give the direction because the law requires that I do so.”  
        
       
      
    12 This direction was the standard form of direction specified in the Judge’s Benchbook. 
     
      
    13 At trial, the appellant’s solicitor had sought that a more extensive direction be given. His submission was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “As for the Murray direction the jury should be told of factors affecting the need to scrutinize the evidence of the complainant with great care; not simply the direction to the jury they must scrutinize her evidence with great care. Kirby J made it clear in  
        Tully v the Queen 
         a point not considered by Crennan J in her majority judgment that he was of that view and said: 
         
         
          
          ‘In giving such a direction, it would have been desirable for the judge to remind the jury of the ‘particular features of the case which demanded a suitable warning’. Those features included the very young age of the complainant at the time of the alleged offences; the circumstances of her mother’s new and ultimately temporary personal relationship with the appellant which could engender animosity and jealousy on the part of the complainant towards the appellant; the long delay between the alleged offences and of the complainant’s statement to her mother (or anyone else) about those offences; the explanations given for such a delay, including after the mother’s relationship with the appellant ended and the family moved to New South Wales; the inconsistencies that arose between the original statements to police and the evidence under cross-examination in court; and the possible inconsistency of the claim of repeated deep sexual penetration and the intact hymen of the complainant. All of these were matters to be weighed by the jury. But, in accordance with  
          Robinson 
          , they needed to be evaluated by them with the assistance of a judicial warning or comment. Against the background of Alford, they needed to be drawn to notice as issues for the jury’s attention in giving real content and substance to the requirement not to convict the appellant except on proof beyond reasonable doubt.’”  
          
         
        
       
       
      The circumstances in which a  
      Murray  
      direction must be given and the content of such a direction, were raised by the appellant. Accordingly a consideration of the relevant case law is warranted. 
       
       
      R v Murray 
       (1987) 11 NSWLR 12; (1987) 30 A Crim R 315 
       
      
    14 In a trial by jury, the common law “requires a warning to be given whenever a warning is necessary to avoid a perceptible risk of miscarriage of justice arising from the circumstances of the case”: Bromley v The Queen (1986) 161 CLR 315 at 319, 323-325; Carr v The Queen [1988] HCA 47; (1988) 165 CLR 314 at 330; Longman v The Queen [1989] HCA 60; (1989) 168 CLR 79 at 86, 107.  
     
      
    15 The obligation to give a warning to the jury in respect of uncorroborated evidence was considered in R v Murray. In that case, the appellant had appealed against conviction for various sexual offences committed against a 19-year-old girl. It was submitted, inter alia, that the trial judge failed to adequately direct the jury on six counts that fell within the terms of s 405C(2) of the Crimes Act. This section removed the requirement for the evidence of a woman in a sexual assault case to be corroborated (see now s 164 of the Evidence Act 1995). 
     
      
    16 Counsel for the appellant at trial requested that the trial judge give the direction required at common law, that it is generally not safe to convict on that charge on the uncorroborated evidence. Lee J, with whom Maxwell and Yeldham JJ agreed, held no warning was required in respect of the six prescribed sexual offences. However, Lee J indicated that there may be circumstances where to avoid a miscarriage of justice, the jury should warned that the evidence of an uncorroborated witness must be scrutinised with great care: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 405 
        C 
        (2) has brought about the result that women are no longer, in the eyes of the law, to be put before juries as persons whose evidence requires corroboration before it is safe to act upon it. That concept which has been in the law for a long time has now gone. That, of course, does not mean that a judge cannot draw attention to the absence of corroborating testimony from witnesses who are shown by the evidence to have been present and able to offer corroboration of the girl's story, if it were true, nor does it preclude the judge from making such observations as he considers ought to be made about the credibility of the complainant's evidence, but always with the proviso, of course, that he must make it clear to the jury that those are his opinions and that the weight to be given to the testimony of the woman is entirely a matter for the jury. The fact that a judge does not comment upon the absence of corroboration of the complainant's evidence cannot, in my view, in the case of those offences to which s 405 
        C 
         applies now be made the basis of a criticism of his summing-up, but again this does not mean that the judge cannot or should not, as is done in all cases of serious crime, stress upon the jury the necessity for the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the truthfulness of the witness who stands alone as proof of the Crown case.  
        In all cases of serious crime it is customary for judges to stress that where there is only one witness asserting the commission of the crime, the evidence of that witness must be scrutinised with great care before a conclusion is arrived at that a verdict of guilty should be brought in; but a direction of that kind does not of itself imply that the witness' evidence is unreliable 
        . 
         
         
        There will be cases where the failure to bring home to the jury the position of the uncorroborated witness will undoubtedly lead to the verdict being set aside but that is a different matter altogether from requiring a direction that it is unsafe to act on the uncorroborated evidence of the complainant in a sex case 
        .” (at 19) (Emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      Robinson v R 
       [1999] HCA 42; 197 CLR 162 
       
      
    17 In Robinson the High Court (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby, Hayne and Callinan JJ) adopted as correct this statement of the law. The Court was concerned with the operation of s 632 of the Criminal Code (Qld) which provided that a person may be convicted of an offence on the uncorroborated testimony of one witness: subs (1); a judge was not required by any rule of law or practice to warn the jury that it was unsafe to convict on the uncorroborated testimony of one witness: subs (2). However, neither subsection prevented a judge from making a comment on the evidence given in the trial where it was appropriate to make in the interest of justice, “but the judge must not warn or suggest in any way to the jury that the law regards any class of complainants as unreliable witnesses”: subs (3).  
     
      
    18 The facts in Robinson involved an assault on a boy aged 8 by a male aged 19. The complainant was involved in a scout’s group and the appellant was a scout leader. The complainant and appellant had planned to “camp out” in the backyard of the complainant’s home. The complainant’s father was in hospital at the time. Because of the weather, the complainant’s mother suggested they might use the garage as an indoor camp. The complainant alleged that during the course of the evening, whilst they were in the garage, the appellant sexually assaulted him twice. There was no one else present. The complainant did not tell his mother about the incident for three years. The appellant agreed with the complainant’s evidence as to the circumstances in which they had spent the night in the garage, but otherwise denied the sexual assault, or any other indecent or inappropriate conduct towards the complainant.  
     
      
    19 In the trial judge’s summing up to the jury, he reminded the jury of the submission which had been made by counsel for the appellant, that the absence of an early complaint may show inconsistency of conduct on the part of the complainant. The trial judge also informed the jury that a delay in complaint was relevant to the complainant’s credibility. He made the observation that there may be many reasons why complaint was not immediately made and told the jury they were matters for them to consider. Apart from that, the judge gave no warnings and made no other comment about the nature of the evidence relied upon by the prosecution. 
     
      
    20 An appeal to the Queensland Court of Appeal was dismissed. In the High Court, the appellant argued, inter alia, that the Court of Appeal had erred in deciding there was not an appreciable risk of a miscarriage of justice by reason of the trial judge’s failure to give the jury an appropriate warning in relation to the complainant’s evidence. The High Court considered that there was merit in this submission.  
     
      
    21 The case had to be determined in light of the provisions of the relevant criminal code. Their Honours noted, at [18]-[20], that s 632(1) did not materially alter the common law and that s 632(2) was not aimed at, and did not abrogate, the general requirement to give a warning whenever it was necessary to do so in order to avoid a risk of miscarriage of justice. Rather, it was directed to the warnings required by common law to be given in certain categories of evidence. Notwithstanding that subs (2) negated any requirement to warn a jury that it was unsafe to convict on the uncorroborated testimony of one witness, that did not mean that in a particular case, there may not be matters personal to the uncorroborated witness, or matters relating to the circumstances generally, which brought into operation the general requirement to give appropriate directions: see Longman v The Queen at 91-94. Their Honours added, at [21], “Moreover, the very nature of the prosecution's onus of proof may require a judge to advert to the absence of corroboration”.  
     
      
    22 After referring to R v Murray, their Honours concluded, at [25], that there were particular features of the Robinson case that demanded a suitable warning from the judge. The Court did not attempt to set out all of those matters, but noted that they included the age of the complainant at the time of the alleged offences; the long period which elapsed before complaint, which in that case meant it was impossible for a medical examination to be undertaken in order to verify or falsify the complaint; and the inconsistency in some aspects of the complainant’s evidence as to whether penetration had occurred. Their Honour’s further noted a curious feature of that case, in that there was the absence of any conversation of any kind between the accused and the complainant about the accused’s conduct. In particular, there was no threat and no warning to the complainant not to tell anyone and, thereafter, the complainant and the accused maintained a harmonious relationship. There was no suggestion of any other misconduct by the accused towards the complainant. 
     
      
    23 In the absence of corroboration, these matters created a perceptible risk of a miscarriage of justice, requiring a warning of a kind that brought home to the jury the need to scrutinise with great care the evidence of the complainant, before arriving at a conclusion of guilt. Their Honours stated that the warning should have referred to the circumstances outlined above and should have been expressed in terms which made clear the caution to be exercised in the light of those circumstances.  
     
      
       
      Tully v R 
       [2006] HCA 56; (2006) 231 ALR 712 
       
      
    24 The requirement to give a Murray direction and the content of any such direction was considered in Tully v R. In that case, the appellant had been charged with a series of sexual offences against a child under the age of 16 years. The complainant was aged between 9 and just over 10 years of age when the alleged offences occurred. The appellant had been in a personal relationship with the complainant’s mother during the period over which the alleged offences occurred. The complainant did not inform her mother of the alleged conduct until about two years after the offences occurred. There was no independent evidence confirming the complainant’s allegations, other than an accurate description she had given of a mole near the appellant’s penis and a tattoo on each of his buttocks, and the evidence of the complainant’s mother of one particular occasion when the appellant and complainant were absent in a car park for so long that the mother began to look for them. However, she gave no evidence of having witnessed any sexual conduct between them. Apart from that, the prosecution case depended solely on the complainant’s version of the appellant’s conduct towards her. The appellant did not give evidence at trial and nor did he call any evidence in his case.  
     
      
    25 Kirby J and Hayne J each considered that a Murray direction should have been given in that case. Their Honours were in the minority, but nonetheless, their consideration of the circumstances in which such a direction should be given is useful. Kirby J considered that the conviction of the appellant depended upon the acceptance of the evidence of the complainant alone. Apart from the complainant’s mother’s evidence as to circumstantial features of the case and the complainant’s evidence as to the moles and tattoos on the appellant’s body, there was an absence of objective reliable confirmatory evidence to support the complainant’s testimony: see Kirby J at [54]. His Honour noted that this evidence did not prove the actual offences and it was not inevitably inconsistent with innocence.  
     
      
    26 His Honour, at [57], said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In giving such a direction, it would have been desirable for the judge to remind the jury of the ‘particular features of the case which demanded a suitable warning’.” 
        
       
      
    27 His Honour then identified the features, such as the complainant’s age, the relationship of the appellant and her mother and the possibility that that could engender animosity and jealousy; the delay in the complaint and the inconsistencies in the complainant’s original statements to police and her evidence in cross-examination, as well as the possible inconsistency of a claim of repeated deep sexual penetration and the complainant’s intact hymen. His Honour noted that these were all matters to be weighed by the jury. However, “in accordance with Robinson, they needed to be evaluated by them with the assistance of a judicial warning or comment”.  
     
      
    28 Hayne J also considered that the issues in Tully were not materially different from those which arose and were considered in Robinson. His Honour stated, at [91], that it was necessary for the trial judge to point out to the jury the need to scrutinise the complainant’s evidence with care when deciding those issues, before convicting the appellant.  
     
      
    29 At [93], his Honour made a comment about the use of bench books (that is, standard forms of instructions to the jury) and said, properly used, such books are invaluable. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “But there is a risk that the prescription of common forms of instruction, which must necessarily be framed without reference to specific facts, and thus in abstract terms, will be used without relating them to the issues that the jury has to decide … The bare recitation to a jury of the relevant sections of a bench book of standard instructions, unrelated to the real issues in the case, does not fulfil the trial judge's task. In particular, to recite the terms of a form of  
        Longman 
         or  
        Robinson 
         direction, without relating that direction to the issues that the judge has identified for the jury as the real issues in the case, will ordinarily not suffice.” 
        
       
      
    30 Callinan J also referred to the principle in Robinson. His Honour observed, at [131], that it was important to focus upon the principles stated in that case, rather than a comparison of its facts with the facts before the Court. His Honour considered that in Tully there had been no error in failing to give a direction. In particular, the complainant’s evidence of the distinctive marks on the appellant’s body, even though not constituting corroboration as such, was a relevant consideration. In addition, there was evidence that made the delay in complaint plausible.  
     
      
    31 Crennan J, with whom Heydon J agreed on this question, also rejected the need for a Murray type direction in Tully. Her Honour held that there was no forensic disadvantage to the appellant arising out of the explained delay. Further, the particular circumstances of the complainant’s age, the sexual nature of the offences, the explained delay between the offences, the report and trial, and the inconsistencies in the complainant’s evidence, were all matters which could be evaluated by the jury in the light of their own experiences. Her Honour considered it was not necessary for the trial judge to give a warning in those circumstances to avoid a miscarriage of justice.  
     
      
       
      First issue on the appeal: was his Honour required to give a  
      Murray 
       direction in respect of count 1? 
       
      
    32 The appellant makes the following complaints about his Honour’s direction to the jury. First, the direction should not have been limited to counts 2 and 3, but should also have been given in respect of count 1.  
     
      
    33 Secondly, the direction may have confused the jury, because his Honour had directed that in respect of those counts, the case against the appellant rested almost entirely on the evidence of the complainant. Likewise, in the case of count 1, the Crown case depended almost entirely upon the evidence of the complainant. It was submitted that in those circumstances, it would have been confusing to the jury to be given the direction in relation to counts 2 and 3, but not in respect of count 1. 
     
      
    34 Thirdly, the appellant complains of that part of the direction where his Honour said, “the case against [the appellant] rests almost entirely on the evidence of [the complainant]”, and since that was the position: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the direction I have to give you is one that I always give to a jury. The warning is not given because I have a view about the evidence. I give the direction because the law requires that I do so.” 
        
       
      
    35 It is necessary to deal with each of these complaints in turn.  
     
      
       
      Did the trial judge err in failing to give a  
      Murray 
       direction in respect of count 1? 
       
      
    36 The first question for redetermination is whether this was a case where a Murray direction should have been given in respect of count 1. As I have already indicated, the circumstances surrounding count 1 involved the complainant and a friend sitting near a bonfire, when the appellant came and sat between them. The friend also gave evidence that she and the complainant had been sitting at the bonfire, when the appellant came and sat between them. However, she identified the appellant as being on her left, meaning that she also was sitting to his right. This was inconsistent with the complainant’s evidence, who said that she was sitting on the appellant’s right. The friend gave evidence that the appellant put an arm around her shoulders and an arm around the complainant’s shoulders. She said this was for a few seconds and that she and the complainant had got up and walked away. 
     
      
    37 The appellant submitted that although proof of count 1 relied in part upon the complainant’s friend’s evidence, her evidence did not tend to confirm one or more elements of the offence charged, that is the touching of the complainant’s breast, and was thus not legally corroborative of the complainant’s evidence.  
     
      
    38 In R v Baskerville [1916] 2 KB 658, Lord Reading CJ said, at 667: 
     
      
       
        
        “We hold that evidence in corroboration must be independent testimony which affects the accused by connecting or tending to connect him with the crime. In other words, it must be evidence which implicates him, that is, which confirms in some material particular not only the evidence that the crime has been committed, but also that the prisoner committed it.” 
        
       
      
    39 In R v Kilbourne (1973) AC 729; [1973] 1 All ER 440, Lord Simon of Glaisdale expressed the concept in these terms, at 758: 
     
      
       
        
        “Corroboration is therefore nothing other than evidence which ‘confirms’ or ‘supports’ or ‘strengthens’ other evidence. It is, in short, evidence which renders other evidence more probable. If so, there is no essential difference between, on the one hand, corroboration and, on the other, ‘supporting evidence’ or ‘evidence which helps to determine the truth of the matter’.” 
        
       
      
    40 In Doney v R [1990] HCA 51; (1990) 171 CLR 207, in the plurality judgment of Deane, Dawson, Toohey, Gaudron and McHugh JJ, their Honours adopted the above statements at 211, [7]-[9] and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is not necessary that corroborative evidence, standing alone, should establish any proposition beyond reasonable doubt. In the case of an accomplice's evidence, it is sufficient if it strengthens that evidence by confirming or tending to confirm the accused's involvement in the events as related by the accomplice. See Baskerville, at p 667; Reg. v. Hester (1973) AC 296, at p 325.” 
        
       
       
      See also  
      BRS v R 
       [1997] HCA 47; (1997) 191 CLR 275 per Brennan CJ at 282-283 and Kirby J at 324;  
      Doggett v R 
       [2001] HCA 46; 208 CLR 343 per McHugh J at 359, [66]-[68] (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed) who stated, “ 
      in determining whether evidence constitutes corroboration, the question for the judge is whether a reasonable jury could regard the evidence as ‘increasing the probability that the complainant's entire testimony was truthful’ 
      : citing  
      R v M  
      [1994] QCA 007, [1995] 1 Qd R 213 at 221 per Davies JA, with whom McPherson JA and Williams J agreed. 
       
      
    41 It is apparent from the majority judgments in Tully that corroboration in the strict legal sense is not necessarily the determinant of whether a Longman direction must be given: see Callinan J at [132]. The purpose of such a warning is to ensure a fair trial and to avoid a miscarriage of justice: see Crennan J at [180]. Her Honour noted, as had been made clear in Longman, it is not imperative to give a warning merely because the circumstances included allegations of sexual misconduct, or because the complainant was young, or because of any delay in complaint. 
     
      
    42 In this case, the complainant’s evidence of the circumstances in which the offences charged in count 1 occurred, found support in the evidence of her friend, notwithstanding some inconsistency between the two accounts. It was open to a jury to regard that inconsistency as not being crucial. Rather, it was open to them to accept the more critical aspects of the evidence, namely, the occasion, location and the circumstance of touching each girl, other than the circumstance of the appellant touching the complainant’s breast. Had the complainant’s friend seen that, her evidence would have been fully corroborative of the complainant’s evidence.  
     
      
    43 The appellant’s solicitor, in his address to the jury, identified the discrepancies in the evidence of the two girls. It was not necessary for the trial judge to repeat those matters. His obligation was to give any direction necessary to ensure that the appellant had a fair trial. For the reasons that I have given, that did not require his Honour to give a Murray direction.  
     
      
       
      Whether the jury would have been confused by the failure to give a  
      Murray 
       direction  
       
      
    44 The appellant submitted that because the Crown case relating to counts 2 and 3 were also ‘word on word cases’, that is, the evidence of the complainant as opposed to the evidence of the appellant, the jury would have been confused by the trial judge’s failure to give a Murray direction in respect of count 1. 
     
      
    45 The matters to which I have already referred to above answer this contention. Although the evidence of the complainant’s friend fell short of full corroboration, her account did significantly support the complainant’s version of events. Therefore, the case against the appellant on count 1 was not strictly a case of ‘word on word’. In these circumstances, the trial judge was entitled to determine that no direction was required. In my opinion, there was no unfairness to the appellant and no miscarriage of justice in his Honour not giving a Murray direction. 
     
      
       
      Did the trial judge err in giving in general terms a  
      Murray 
       direction? 
       
      
    46 Strictly, this question does not arise, as the trial judge only gave a direction in relation to counts 2 and 3 and in my opinion, was not required to give any such direction in respect of count 1. However, as the issue was raised, it is appropriate to observe that in Robinson, the High Court stated that such a direction should be related to the circumstances of the case. The remarks of Kirby J, in Tully, as to the content of the direction, accords with what the Court had said in Robinson, as do the comments of Hayne J to which I have referred: see [25] ff above. 
     
      
    47 Finally, the appellant contended that the caveat the trial judge placed at the end of his directions, namely, that he was giving the direction as he was required by law to do so, significantly limited the force and authority that such a direction ought to have. Again, this matter does not arise, as a Murray direction was not required. However, it should be noted that in Longman Deane J adopted the comment of King CJ in R v Pahuja (1987) 49 SASR 191; 30 A Crim R 118 at 125, that a judge: 
     
      
       
        
        “… is free to frame the caution or warning in such terms as he sees fit. It must be clear to the jury, either from a specific direction or at least from the general tenor of the summing up, that they are free to reject the judge's suggested approach to the evidence of the alleged victim or any views which he might express on such questions of fact. He must not convey the impression that the caution or warning is given as a matter of law.” 
        
       
      
    48 Had this Murray direction been in issue in this case, there may have been a real question as to whether the trial judge erred in the direction he gave. 
     
      
    49 Having regard to what I have said above in relation to the content of a Murray direction, I should draw attention to the fact that King CJ, in Pahuja, also considered that a jury warning may be given in conventional terms, or in such terms as the trial judge considered appropriate. This part of his Honour’s statement was also endorsed by Deane J. However, this approach must now be read in light of the later statement of the High Court in Robinson and the comments of Kirby and Hayne JJ in Tully.  
     
      
    50 Accordingly, the principle challenge upon which the appeal has been brought has not succeeded.  
     
      
       
      Whether the jury needed to be directed that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the acts advanced by way of relationship evidence  
       
      
    51 The Crown adduced evidence of other conduct of a sexual nature that the appellant had exhibited towards the complainant. Insofar as count 1 was concerned, that evidence is summarised at [7] above.  
     
      
    52 The trial judge gave the following direction to the jury in respect of this evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Members of the jury, my next direction to you is to repeat the direction of law I gave you during the course of the trial concerning the other incidents that the crown alleges occurred between [the appellant] and [the complainant]. I have told you that this is known as the contextual or relationship evidence and I repeat the direction that I gave you then. The other acts relied upon by the crown are summarised as follows for your convenience and you have heard the evidence and the cross-examination of [the complainant] about them. In summary form they are, firstly, the kissing of the complainant’s ear by [the appellant] and poking his tongue in her ear. Then there was the putting the hand on the complainant’s bottom. Then there was the touching of the bottom of [the complainant] by [the appellant] and the gross comments. Then there was the discussion of pornographic magazines and the reading of a story from that magazine. Then there were conversations between [the appellant] and the complainant about her sexual development and relationship with boys. Then there was the giving of the alcohol to the complainant by [the appellant] as alleged by the crown … 
         
         
        Members of the jury, as I said to you before, it is important that I explain to you the relevance of this evidence of other acts. This evidence is admitted solely for the purpose of placing the evidence of the particular acts relied upon by the crown in the indictment to prove those charges and put them in a true and realistic context. It is confined, in other words, to making the circumstances of the particular offences charged more intelligible, otherwise a jury such as yourselves may wonder about the likelihood of the apparently isolated acts occurring suddenly without any apparent reason. If the complainant gave evidence of isolated acts of sexual misconduct a jury such as yourselves would be entitled to say to themselves, as persons of commonsense, well, really, it is very odd for there to be such isolated acts between these persons. Thus it is open for the crown to lead evidence of other acts of a sexual nature between [the appellant] and [the complainant] and I have just outlined in brief summary form what they are. However, I must give you certain important warnings with regard to this evidence of other acts which for convenience are referred to as context evidence. You must not use as evidence of other acts as establishing a tendency on the part of the accused to commit offences of this type charged and therefore it cannot be used as an element in the chain of proof of the offences charged. You must not substitute the evidence of other acts for evidence of the specific offences charged. You must not reason that because [the appellant] may have done something wrong to [the complainant] on another occasion he must have done so on the occasions charged as set out in the indictment. You must give careful consideration to the timeframe within which the other acts are alleged to have occurred. The more remote the other sexual activity is the less will be its weight. 
         
         
        [The appellant] has categorically denied each alleged incident that forms the other acts with the exception of the Christmas presents to [the appellant] which he said was part of presents that he gave to all of [the appellant’s] family.”  
        
       
      
    53 Prior to his Honour giving this direction, the appellant’s solicitor had sought a direction that such evidence needed to be proven beyond reasonable doubt. In seeking that direction, the solicitor relied upon Gipp v R [1998] HCA 21; (1998) 194 CLR 106; R v FJB (1999) 105 A Crim R 567 at 577. Alternatively, he sought the jury be directed that they may think it should be proven beyond reasonable doubt: Shepherd v R [1990] HCA 56; (1990) 170 CLR 573. 
     
      
    54 In his submissions to this Court, Mr Walsh referred to the High Court’s recent decision in HML v The Queen; SB v The Queen; OAE v The Queen [2008] HCA 16; (2008) 82 ALJR 723 and in particular, to certain remarks made by Hayne J (see [102] ff) relating to the admissibility of the sexual conduct of an accused person other than in respect of the offence charged. Mr Walsh contended that his Honour’s judgment supported his submission that the jury ought to have been directed that the evidence of the other conduct needed to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
    55 However, the High Court in HML was not of one mind on this issue and there is a question, in any event, as to whether the decision, which was made in a common law context, applies in this State. The judgments in HML were analysed by McClellan CJ in CL in this Court in the recent decision of DJV v R [2008] NSWCCA 272. Having regard to his Honour’s analysis of the issues, it is unnecessary for me to engage upon that process. Rather, it is sufficient, having regard to the issue in this case, where the evidence was adduced as relationship evidence, not tendency evidence, to apply the law as stated by McClellan CJ at CL (with whom Hidden and Fullerton JJ agreed), at [31] that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Context evidence does not require a direction that it be proved beyond reasonable doubt.”’ 
        
       
       
      (His Honour said, at [30], that the standard of proof of tendency evidence in sexual assault cases was “ 
      beyond reasonable doubt 
      ”.) 
       
      
    56 As that is the only issue raised in relation to the trial judge’s direction on this point, this ground should also be dismissed. It follows, in my opinion, that the appeal should be dismissed.  
     
      
    57 KIRBY J: I agree with Beazley JA. 
     
      
    58 HALL J: I agree with Beazley JA.

      2008/2802 Regina v Paul James Wilkinson (No. 2)  
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT (on threshold issue concerning application for leave to withdraw plea of guilty to murder - T52) 
       
      
    1 JOHNSON J: On 17 October 2008 the Offender, Paul James Wilkinson, appeared before me with respect to an indictment alleging two offences, murder and arson. Upon arraignment, he pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. With respect to the second count of arson, he pleaded guilty. The Crown indicated that it did not accept the plea of guilty to manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment, and a trial date was confirmed to commence on 18 November 2008.  
     
      
    2 On 12 November 2008, the matter was listed before me at the request of the legal representatives for the Offender. I note that these legal representatives (both counsel and solicitor) had appeared for the Offender since July 2005. On that day, at the request of his legal representatives, the Offender was re-arraigned on the count of murder. To that charge, he pleaded guilty. The Crown then asked the Court to formally convict the Offender. Nothing was said in opposition to that application by the solicitor for the Offender, and I then said, ""The accused, having pleaded guilty to the count of murder and having pleaded, on 17 October 2008, to the second count on the indictment of arson, I convict the accused of both offences"".  
     
      
    3 The matter was then adjourned for the purpose of a sentencing hearing, with it coming back before me on 21 November 2008 and 2 December 2008, when some evidence was taken. The matter was then adjourned for the sentencing hearing to proceed in its entirety, and to completion, commencing Monday 15 December 2008.  
     
      
    4 During the course of the week preceding 15 December 2008, my Associate was informed by the legal representatives for the Offender that their instructions had been withdrawn.  
     
      
    5 On 15 December 2008, the Offender’s counsel and solicitor appeared and, in due course, I granted them leave to withdraw. Mr Donnelly, solicitor, then appeared for the Offender and announced that an application was to be made for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty to the count of murder.  
     
      
    6 I indicated that, having regard to the history of the matter, such an application ought proceed promptly. I raised with Mr Donnelly, the legal consequences of my convicting the Offender of murder, following his plea of guilty to that offence. In due course, I stood over until today argument on a threshold question, namely, whether it is open to this Court, as the Court of trial, to entertain an application for leave to withdraw a plea of guilty where the Court has convicted the Offender following his plea, or whether it is for the Court of Criminal Appeal, on an appeal to that Court under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, to consider such an application if made to it.  
     
      
    7 Today, Mr Turnbull SC has appeared for the Offender. He submits that a single judge of this Court may entertain an application for leave to withdraw a plea of guilty, even after a conviction has been entered by the judge, as long as the application is made before sentence is passed. In support of that submission, he referred to a number of authorities including the decision of the Court of Appeal in Frodsham v O'Gorman (1979) 1 NSWLR 685, and decisions of the High Court of Australia in Griffiths v The Queen (1976 1977) 137 CLR 294 and The Queen v Maxwell (1995) 184 CLR 501.  
     
      
    8 The Crown submits that the order of conviction made by me following the plea of guilty constitutes a final order, or final determination, so that it is not open to the Court, as the Court of trial, to entertain this application. The Crown places reliance upon the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in Norvenska v Director of Public Prosecutions [2007] NSWCCA 158 (particularly at [8]) and ss.2 and 5 Criminal Appeal Act 1912, together with passages in the decision of the High Court in Maxwell.  
     
      
    9 It has not been put that any statutory provision in the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 bears directly on this question. Section 157 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 does not have direct application because that section applies where there is a change of plea following the commencement of trial by jury. Section 207 of that Act has no application because that provision relates solely to summary proceedings in the Local Court. Thus, the present issue falls to be determined by consideration of general principles.  
     
      
    10 During the course of submissions, I have raised with counsel a number of other authorities where the meaning of the term “conviction”, and its legal effect, has been considered. These cases include R v Holton [2004] NSWCCA 214 and R v Stone (2005) 64 NSWLR 413. These cases have considered and applied the decisions of the High Court in Griffiths and Maxwell, and contain some analysis of the judgments in Maxwell. Counsel have not had an opportunity to consider those cases to the extent that they shed light on the issue to be determined on the present application.  
     
      
    11 The present issue is a significant one for the administration of criminal justice in this State. Today counsel, as I have said, have not had an opportunity to consider the further authorities to which I have referred for the purposes of making submissions on this question. I am hearing this argument on the last day of term for 2008. I have already determined that this matter will proceed on 29 and 30 January 2009, that is, in the week before the commencement of the next Law Term, either by way of the hearing of the application to withdraw the plea of guilty or, if I determined that there was no power to entertain such an application, by way of sentencing hearing.  
     
      
    12 The present question involves a significant legal issue which ought to be determined carefully, and ought not be determined on the run. In my view, further submissions of the parties will assist in the determination of that question.  
     
      
    13 I also have regard to the current state of these proceedings. They have been on foot for some time. They have been before me for various purposes since the middle of October this year. There is an expectation that the issues in these proceedings ought be determined as expeditiously as possible, at the same time as the parties having a proper opportunity to make submissions on important legal questions to assist the Court.  
     
      
    14 What I propose to do is to adjourn the hearing of the present application until 29 and 30 January 2009. At that time, I will hear the application to withdraw the plea of guilty in its entirety. I emphasise that the present legal question remains open, and it will be determined in the light of fuller submissions than those which have been made today. It is important that that issue be determined expeditiously and only after proper hearing, and that process ought be coupled with the hearing of the application to withdraw the plea itself, so that the Court may move directly to that issue.  
     
      
    15 I will give directions shortly for the Offender to file and serve any evidence to be relied upon for the purpose of this application. It is for the Offender to satisfy the Court, firstly, that it is legally open to entertain this application and, secondly, if it is legally open, to seek to establish that the relevant discretion ought be exercised in favour of the withdrawal of the plea of guilty. Thus, evidence will need to be filed and served by the Offender bearing upon that issue, so that on the next occasion this aspect of the matter can be heard and determined in the manner that I have foreshadowed. 
     
     [For discussion as to future progress of the matter, see transcript] 
    16 I make the following orders:  
     
      
       
      (1) The Offender is to file and serve any evidence to be relied upon in support of the application for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty by 4.00 pm on 14 January 2009.  
       
       
      (2) The Crown is to file and serve any material upon which it seeks to rely on that application by 4.00 pm on 21 January 2009. In that respect, I note that it is not necessary for the Crown to file and serve any of the material presently comprised in MFI 1. I note that the Crown is to provide a complete copy of MFI 1 to the present solicitor for the Offender no later than Monday next, 22 December 2008.  
       
       
      (3) The part heard hearing of the application for leave to withdraw the plea of guilty on the murder count is adjourned to resume at 10.00 am on Thursday 29 January 2009 and to continue, if necessary, on 30 January 2009.  
       
       
      (4) I refuse bail to the Offender.

     Headnote 
     
     
      
    The appellants, Samadi and Djait, were jointly tried before her Honour Tupman DCJ and convicted by a jury upon 12 counts of jointly administering a stupefying drug to 12 separate complainants, with the intention of stealing property from each named complainant, contrary to s 38 of the Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    In the same trial, Samadi was individually charged and convicted upon one count of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act. The complainant, HI, was also a complainant in one of the s 38 counts. Djait was also individually charged and convicted with 3 counts of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act. The complainant, HYA, was also another of the complainants in one of the s 38 counts. 
     
      
    The offences of which the appellants were convicted occurred between 13 and 19 October 2004. The s 38 offences were based upon allegations that the appellants spiked the drinks of the 12 complainants with a stupefying drug, Clonazepam, with intent to enable themselves to commit an indictable offence, namely, to steal the property of the individual complainants. The basis of the sexual assault charges was that the relevant appellant took advantage of the specified complainant’s drugged state to sexually assault that complainant. 
     
      
    Tupman DCJ imposed an overall sentence on each appellant of 12 years non-parole, with an additional term of 3 years.  
     
      
    The appellants appeal against their convictions, essentially contending i) that the trial judge erred in admitting, pursuant to s 98 of the Evidence Act 1995, the evidence in respect of the s 38 offences in consideration of each other s 38 offence, in particular, admitting into evidence the events of the incident involved in count 4, on the trial of the incident involved in counts 1-3, as being part of the one transaction, in accordance with O'Leary v R [1946] HCA 44; (1946) 73 CLR 566; ii) that there should have been joint, but separate trials in respect of the s 38 counts arising out of each of the other incidents; and iii) that there should have been individual and separate trials in respect of the sexual assault offences. The appellants also seek leave to appeal against sentence. 
     
      
    Djait raises a further separate ground of appeal, alleging that her Honour erred in failing to discharge the jury on Djait’s application following upon the fitness trial of Samadi, in circumstances where the jury did not hear evidence in the trial proper for over a week. 
     
      
    Held per Beazley JA (Hislop and Price JJ agreeing) 
     
      
    Did the trial judge err in applying O’Leary? 
     
      
    1. The evidence surrounding the incident in count 4, was so close in time, proximity and material particulars to evidence of counts 1-3. There was no error in the trial judge permitting the evidence in respect of count 4 to be admitted to explain and prove the state of mind of the appellants at the time of the commission of counts 1-3: [63], [172]-[173].

    3. It was open to the jury to draw the inference, that the appellants committed the s 38 offences involved in counts 1-3, both in relation to the intention to steal and the administration of the drug Clonazepam: [63], [172]-[173]. 
     
      
    Did the trial judge err in admitting the evidence in respect of the s 38 offences in consideration of each other s 38 offence as coincidence evidence, pursuant to s 98 of the Evidence Act 1995? 
     
      
    4. A determination under s 98 “is essentially evaluative and predictive” and requires an assessment upon which “reasonable minds may differ”: [68], [172]-[173]. 
     
      
     R v Zhang 
      [2005] NSWCCA 437; 158 A Crim R 504;  
     R v Fletcher 
      [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308 (considered) 
      
    5. There was no error in the trial judge identifying 13 similarities, in time, place and methodology, between the s 38 counts on the indictment and concluding that those similarities were sufficient to meet the requirements of s 98 in the circumstances: [73]-[74], [81], [172]-[173]. 
     
      
    6. The similarities were capable of being rationally probative of the guilt of the appellants or, alternatively, rationally probative of the relevant facts in issue to prove the guilt of the appellants in relation to each of the other offences: [70], [172]-[173]. 
     
      
    7. For evidence to be admitted as coincidence evidence under s 98, there does not have to be an exact parallel of circumstances. Part of the purpose of coincidence evidence is to facilitate the proof of a circumstantial case: [85], [97], [172]-[173]. 
     
      
    8. These similarities were made out, notwithstanding that not all complainants had their property stolen, or that there could also have been some additional wrong intention, such as to sexually assault the victims in the s 38 counts: [74], [85]-[87], [89], [96], [97], [172]-[173]. 
     
      
    9. The probative value of the coincidence evidence did not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect for the purposes of the Evidence Act 1995 s 101(2): [101]-[102], [172]-[173]. 
     
      
    10. The trial judge, having recognised the potential prejudice to the applicants in the admission of the coincidence evidence, gave appropriate directions to the jury: [102], [172]-[173]. 
     
      
     Did the trial judge err in failing to order separate trials? 
      
    11. The question of whether there should be joint or separate trials is a matter for discretion for the judge at the trial. The discretion must be exercised judicially and not capriciously, having regard to the interests of justice as well as the interests of the accused: [108], [172]-[173].

     Merritt v Roso 
      (1985) 19 A Crim R 360 at 364 (referred to). 
      
    12. There was no error in her Honour refusing the appellants’ application for separate trials in respect of the ss 38 and 61I offences: [110]; [116], [172]-[173]. 
     
      
     De Jesus v R 
      [1986] HCA 65; 61 ALJR 1 (referred to). 
      
    13. Her Honour was conscious of the possible prejudices and considered that appropriate directions to the jury could overcome any possible prejudice. There was no error in that procedure, nor her Honour’s directions to the jury: [117]-[118], [172]-[173]. 
     
      
     Did her Honour err in failing to discharge the jury following the fitness trial of Samadi? 
      
    14. In determining whether to discharge a jury, the underlying principle is that an accused must receive a fair trial in accordance with law: [133], [172]-[173]. 
     
      
     Crofts v R  
     [1996] HCA 22; (1996) 186 CLR 427 (considered) 
      
    15. A challenge that a trial judge’s refusal to discharge a jury is a challenge to conviction and in that circumstance, the court’s powers to intervene are prescribed by s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912: [134], [172]-[173].

     [2004] NSWCCA 38; [2004] 144 A Crim R 124 (referred to) 
      
    16. Her Honour gave clear directions to the jury immediately upon the resumption of the hearing. There was no miscarriage of justice in this case in the trial judge refusing to discharge the jury: [137], [172]-[173].

    Did her Honour err in sentencing the appellants? 
     
      
    17. Drink or food spiking is an insidious form of criminal activity, which demands severe punishment that reflects the primacy of general deterrence: [160], [172]-[173].

     R v Harrison 
      (1997) 93 A Crim R 314 (applied) 
      
    18. Having found special circumstances, her Honour erred in sentencing the appellants for a shorter period on parole than is contemplated even by the statutory ratio: [163]-[164], [168], [172]-[173]. 
     
      
    19. The appellant Samadi would have a justifiable sense of grievance in having the same sentence imposed as his co-offender, when he was convicted of one offence under s61I, whereas his co-offender Djait was convicted of three offences under the section: [167], [168], [172]-[173].

     Chebli DJAIT v Regina 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: The appellants, Adel Samadi (Samadi) and Chebli Djait (Djait), were jointly tried before her Honour Tupman DCJ and a jury upon 12 counts of jointly administering a stupefying drug to 12 separate complainants, with the intention of stealing property from each named complainant, contrary to s 38 of the Crimes Act 1900: counts 1-11 and 15. The appellants were each convicted upon all 12 of the s 38 counts.  
     
      
    2 Samadi was individually charged upon one count of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act: count 16 (and count 17 in the alternative). This count involved the complainant HI, who was also the complainant in count 15. Samadi was convicted on count 16. 
     
      
    3 Djait was individually charged with 3 counts of sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s 61I of the Crimes Act: counts 12-14. These charges involved the complainant HYA, who was also the complainant in count 11. Djait was convicted on counts 12-14. 
     
      
    4 Counts 11-14 and count 16-17 were also tried jointly with the s 38 counts. 
     
      
    5 The maximum penalty for the offences charged in counts 1-11 and 15, the s 38 offences, is a term of imprisonment of 25 years. The maximum penalty for the offences charged in counts 12-14 and 16, the s 61I offences, is a term of imprisonment of 14 years. The standard non-parole period for an offence under s 61I is 7 years: the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999: Pt 4, Div1A, item 7 of the table. 
     
      
    6 Tupman DCJ imposed an overall sentence on each appellant of 12 years non-parole, with an additional term of 3 years.  
     
      
    7 The appellants appeal against their convictions and also seek leave to appeal against sentence.  
     
      
    8 The offences of which the appellants were convicted occurred between 13 and 19 October 2004. The s 38 offences were based upon allegations that the appellants spiked the drinks of the 12 complainants with a stupefying drug, Clonazepam, with intent to enable themselves to commit an indictable offence, namely, to steal the property of the individual complainants. The basis of the sexual assault charges was that the relevant appellant took advantage of the specified complainant’s drugged state to sexually assault that complainant.  
     
      
       
      Issues on the appeal 
       
      
    9 The issues on the appeal arise out of a number of pre-trial rulings made by her Honour on 27 January 2006. Those issues may be summarised as follows.  
     
      
       
      (a) First, the appellants allege that her Honour erred in admitting, pursuant to s 98 of the  
      Evidence Act 
       1995, the evidence in respect of the s 38 offences in consideration of each other s 38 offence. They also allege error in the trial judge’s directions relating to the coincidence evidence. 
       
       
      (b) Secondly, that her Honour erred in admitting into evidence the events of the incident involved in count 4, on the trial of the incident involved in counts 1-3, as being part of the one transaction, in accordance with  
      O'Leary v R 
       [1946] HCA 44; (1946) 73 CLR 566. 
       
       
      (c) Thirdly, that her Honour erred in not ordering that there be a joint trial of counts 1-3 that arise out of the first incident, but separately from the other counts upon the indictment. The appellants also contend that there should have been separate trials in respect of the s 38 counts arising out of each of the other incidents.  
       
       
      (d) Fourthly, that her Honour erred in not ordering the sexual assault offences be heard separately from the s 38 counts and separately for each appellant. Djait also complains about the trial judge’s directions to the jury on this point. 
       
      
    10 Djait raises a further separate ground of appeal (ground 13), alleging that her Honour erred in failing to discharge the jury on Djait’s application following upon the fitness trial of Samadi, in circumstances where the jury did not hear evidence in the trial proper for over a week. 
     
      
       
      The evidence relating to each offence 
       
      
    11 Some detail of the evidence in respect of each offence is necessary, in order to understand the challenges that are made by the appellants to their convictions. Senior counsel and counsel for Samadi and Djait respectively, have each summarised the relevant evidence. This is not disputed by the Crown, other than for some supplementary evidence to which it refers. In addition, the Crown relies upon the summary of trial prepared for the purposes of the hearing. What follows is a précis of that material.  
     
      
       
      Counts 1, 2 and 3 
       
      
    12 Counts 1, 2 and 3 related to a single incident which was referred to, both at trial and on the appeal, as incident 1, alleged to have occurred on 13 October 2004. On that date, two women, TV and PD, were at the Pontoon Bar at Darling Harbour, at about 8.30 pm. TV was a resident of Sydney and PD was a friend of hers visiting from interstate. At the Pontoon Bar, they met JA, a visitor from Adelaide who was attending a work conference. JA had gone to the Pontoon Bar for a drink. Whilst those three persons were talking, the appellants approached them and introduced themselves as “Andy” (Djait) and “Dylan” (Samadi). They socialised together for some time. JA gave one or both of the appellants his business card. Samadi went to the bar and bought drinks for TV, PD and JA. TV began to feel a bit drowsy, but did not say anything at the time. At about midnight, one or other of the appellants suggested the group move to another location to continue drinking. TV, PD and JA began to walk from the Pontoon Bar with the appellants, but not long afterwards, they parted company, and TV, PD and JA ultimately ended up in JA’s hotel room, where they passed out.  
     
      
    13 Each has either no memory, or only a patchy memory, of what occurred from the time they left the Pontoon Bar. None has any real memory of going to the hotel room. When they woke the next morning, each realised they could not remember parts of the previous evening. They all had the same physical symptoms, feeling unwell, disoriented and hungover, notwithstanding that the amount of alcohol each had drunk would not have been sufficient to produce that degree of hangover. 
     
      
    14 Both PD and JA left Sydney in accordance with their plans. 
     
      
    15 The appellants were arrested on 19 October 2004, in respect of some of the later offences and their arrest attracted media publicity, to the effect there were allegations that they had been spiking tourist’s drinks in the Sydney CBD area. TV, who was a journalist, saw the media reports and recognising that she had suffered the same symptoms, she reported the incident to the police. No forensic testing was undertaken of TV, PD and JA. However, JA’s business card was found in the possession of Samadi on his arrest. In addition, TV identified both of the appellants at a photo identification parade sometime after their arrest. There was no other identification of either appellant for these three charges.  
     
      
    16 Djait did not dispute that he was present with Samadi and each of TV, PD and JA on 13 October 2004 and the other occasions relevant to the counts on the indictment. However, that concession was not made until counsel for Djait’s opening address to the jury. By that time, the trial judge had made rulings on the appellants’ applications for separate trials, the severance of the counts on the indictment and in respect of the Crown’s intended reliance on evidence in one group of counts as coincidence evidence in other groups of counts. 
     
      
       
      Count 4 
       
      
    17 This incident occurred at about midnight on 13 October 2004, after incident 1 involving TV, PD and JA. The victim in this incident, SM, had been out drinking for a number of hours on 13 October 2004. He was making his way home to Pyrmont, walking through Cockle Bay near the Pontoon Bar, when he was approached by the appellants. After some conversation, SM agreed that they could come to his unit and have a few drinks. When at his unit, SM opened a bottle of wine and poured three glasses. SM had already had a substantial quantity of alcohol before he met the appellants. Nonetheless, he noticed the contents of his glass appeared cloudy, so he threw the rest down the sink. He lost consciousness fairly soon thereafter and woke next morning. The appellants were not present and a quantity of property had been stolen from him, including jewellery, a Tag Heuer watch, a Sony Play Station, an IBM laptop computer, a digital camera, credit cards, cash and clothing, including a leather jacket. The total value of missing items was about $17,500. 
     
      
    18 SM, who felt unwell, disoriented and hungover, contacted police. He was taken to hospital and blood and urine samples revealed the presence of the drug Clonazepam in his bloodstream. Djait’s fingerprints were found in SM’s unit. DNA testing was done on a sock located on the lounge room floor, which matched Samadi’s DNA.  
     
      
    19 When Djait was arrested, he was wearing SM’s watch and leather jacket, and SM’s Play Station and digital camera were located in Djait’s home. The remainder of the property alleged to have been stolen has never been recovered. SM’s credit card was used on the morning of 14 October 2004, to pay for a taxi fare from Ultimo to Riverwood, where Samadi lived at the time. 
     
      
       
      Counts 5 and 6 
       
      
    20 Incident 3, which gave rise to the charges on counts 5 and 6, occurred on the evening of 14 October. KH and TM, both young Japanese women living temporarily in Sydney, were walking up Liverpool Street in the city. The appellants walked past them, and one of them asked KH and TM if they would like a drink, suggesting the nearby Shark Bar, which was in Liverpool Street. KH and TM agreed and went to the bar with the appellants. Djait introduced himself as “Andy”. Each of the appellants told KH and TM that they were from New Caledonia. One or other of the appellants purchased drinks for them and shortly after drinking them, the young women began to feel tired. The appellants walked them home to their Darlinghurst address. Both victims felt unsteady on their feet during the walk home and both had fragmented and blurry memories of the walk home and of arriving home.  
     
      
    21 KH woke the next morning and went to work. TM did not wake until 5 pm the following afternoon. She noticed her wallet was missing from her handbag. She found it on the ground near the door to her unit, but her credit and other cards were missing. In addition, American Express travellers cheques worth about ¥20,000, about $200-300 in Australian currency and a gold ring with rubies in it, were also missing.  
     
      
    22 The credit card had been used for a cab charge after it was stolen. 
     
      
    23 KH and TM were told of media reports about drink spiking incidents, following the arrest of the appellants, after which they reported their incident to police. The symptoms each of them experienced after the encounter was similar to those experienced by other victims. 
     
      
    24 One of TM’s missing travellers cheques was found in Djait’s premises during a search conducted there after his arrest. 
     
      
    25 Neither of these complainants was able to identify either appellant during a photo identification process. However, each provided some recognition of a photograph of Djait. There was no blood or urine analysis done and both KH and TM’s evidence was that no property was stolen from KH.  
     
      
       
      Counts 7 and 8 
       
      
    26 The events comprising incident 4 occurred in the early hours of 16 October 2004. On the previous evening, that is, 15 October 2004, YS and RW were at the Three Wise Monkeys hotel on the corner of George and Liverpool Streets Sydney, with their friend ME. The three women were Japanese, in Australia on working holiday visas. They met the appellants not long after midnight. They had previously met Djait about a month earlier, at the same hotel, when he had introduced himself as “Andy”. On the night of 15 October, Djait introduced Samadi as “Dylan”. The appellants purchased drinks for the three women, the last of which was a sweet, coloured cocktail. After drinking that, each began to experience symptoms, including full or partial memory loss. YS could not remember how she got home. However, shortly after 2 am, Samadi was seen on surveillance footage assisting her to leave the hotel. She returned alone, about 30 minutes later, but in such a state the security officer at the hotel obtained permission to escort her to her flat nearby. 
     
      
    27 RW has no memory of how she got home, but surveillance footage showed that Samadi walked her home to her flat at about 1.45 am. He took her to her bedroom, where he remained for about 20 minutes, leaving the premises at about 2 am. At about that time, he made a telephone call to Djait and shortly afterwards returned to the Three Wise Monkeys. He was seen leaving the bar with YS at about 2.15 am.  
     
      
    28 RW woke next morning feeling symptoms of muscle weakness and nausea. A digital camera, mobile phone and $59 in cash had been stolen from her handbag, which she had with her when she entered her flat with Samadi. The evidence suggested the appellant Samadi used the SIM card from RW’s phone to make the telephone call to Djait as he was leaving the premises at about 2 am. 
     
      
    29 No property was stolen from YS.  
     
      
    30 The three women went to the police the next day and had blood and urine samples taken. The presence of the drug Clonazepam was detected in all three samples.  
     
      
    31 During the course of the evening, YS had taken some photographs and gave her camera for processing. 
     
      
    32 RW’s camera was subsequently located in Djait’s premises after his arrest. There were digital photographs on the camera of the appellants together with the three women at the Three Wise Monkeys on 15 October 2004. YS and RW identified both of the appellants during a photo identification parade. 
     
      
       
      Counts 9, 10 and 11 
       
      
    33 These counts involved incident 5 and occurred on 17-18 October 2004. HK and HA, two young Korean women, and JH, a young Swiss man, were friends working and holidaying in Sydney. On 17 October, they were at the Shark Bar in Liverpool Street, where they were drinking together and playing pool. 
     
      
    34 The appellants approached them and joined their game of pool. Djait introduced himself as “Andy” and said he was from New Caledonia. The appellants bought drinks for the group and a round of cocktails on learning that it was JH’s birthday the following day. Shortly after drinking the cocktail, the two women started to feel symptoms, including a loss of coordination, weakness in their limbs and disorientation. The appellants suggested the group move to another location to continue celebrating. They did so, although neither HK or HA have any memory of events from this time. 
     
      
    35 One of the young Korean women (identified) woke the next morning in her flat and discovered her wallet was missing, containing her Visa card, $70 in cash, a Commonwealth bank card and her Korean driver’s licence. 
     
      
    36 JH had no memory of events from just before midnight on 17 October, when he left the Shark Bar with the two women and the appellants. He woke in the afternoon the next day, having made his way back to his backpacker’s hotel in Kings Cross. He had a cut to his right eye and blood on his hands, but he had no recollection of how that had occurred. His mobile phone had been stolen. 
     
      
    37 HA went to Djait’s unit at Peakhurst in a taxi with him. Subsequent events are the subject of the three sexual assault matters involving Djait and are dealt with below. HA reported that her digital camera was stolen from her during the course of that evening. Earlier, photographs had been taken of the appellants with the HK, HA and JH on the camera. The camera was found in Djait’s premises after his arrest. All three victims reported the offences to police late on 19 October 2004. Testing done on blood and urine samples revealed the presence of Clonazepam in the bloodstream of each.  
     
      
    38 JH identified both appellants during a photographic identification procedure. HA identified Djait in a photographic identification procedure. The photographs used in these identifications had been taken from YS’s camera, one of the victims in incident 4. 
     
      
    39 On the afternoon of 19 October 2004, JH saw Djait walking past a coffee shop in Kings Cross near the Highfield Hotel. He contacted police who attended and arrested Djait. 
     
      
    40 It is convenient to next deal with incident 6, which was the last count, alleging an offence contrary to s 38 of the Crimes Act. 
     
      
       
      Count 15 
       
      
    41 Incident 6 occurred on 19 October 2004 and involved a Swedish tourist, HI. Some time on that day, Samadi approached HI and they were later joined by Djait. Samadi paid for drinks at the Opera Bar. Samadi and HI left the Bar and went to her room in the Highfield Hotel. HI spoke to the police the next day and forensic testing of blood and urine showed the presence of the drug Clonazepam.  
     
      
       
      Counts 12, 13 and 14 (Djait only) 
       
      
    42 Counts 12-14 arise out of incident 5 and are the three sexual assault matters with which Djait was charged. It will be recalled that HA returned with Djait to his unit at Peakhurst. During the course of the evening of 17 October, or the early hours of 18 October, Djait had penile/vaginal sexual intercourse, then oral sexual intercourse, then penile/vaginal sexual intercourse with HA. HA had some memory of the events and was, to some limited extent, aware of what was occurring. She gave evidence, however, that her memory of events was hazy and fragmented. She was not physically injured, nor was Djait forceful or verbally unpleasant to her. The following morning, she left the premises and returned home after Djait had taken her to breakfast and paid for a taxi for her.  
     
      
    43 At trial, the issue in relation to these counts was consent. As stated above, at [*19], counsel for Djait conceded in his opening address to the jury that Djait had been present on the occasions relevant to these counts on the indictment. 
     
      
       
      Count 16 (Samadi only) 
       
      
    44 Count 16 was also based upon the events of incident 6, but was a charge of sexual assault against Samadi only. The Crown case was that after Samadi and HI left Djait, Samadi had penile/vaginal intercourse with HI. She had no memory of this and only a hazy memory of some of the surrounding circumstances, including his taking off her clothing, seeing his pants, seeing his penis and his showing her a condom packet. The Crown’s case was based upon DNA evidence matching that of Samadi in semen located on the bed sheet and sperm found on a high vaginal swab taken from HI. HI was not injured. Photographs of the appellants were located on HI’s camera. Samadi denied that sexual intercourse had occurred. 
     
      
       
      Approach of appellants to arguments on the appeal 
       
      
    45 Save for one ground of appeal in the case of the appellant Djait, the appellants raised the same issues on the appeal, albeit in differently numbered grounds of appeal. The independent ground in Djait’s appeal relates to her Honour’s refusal to discharge the jury. Although the appellants were each separately represented counsel informed the Court that a joint approach had been taken to the issues raised on the appeal. Separate arguments were advanced in respect of the sentence appeals.  
     
      
    46 Counsel chose to deal first with the second issue raised on the appeal, that is, the O’Leary point. The submission was that this was the initial error made by her Honour and the other errors in the trial flowed from that. 
     
      
       
      Did the trial judge err in applying  
      O’Leary 
      ?: Samadi ground 2: Djait ground 7 
       
      
    47 It was alleged that her Honour erred in admitting into evidence the events of incident 2 (count 4) upon the trial of incident 1 (counts 1-3) as being part of the one transaction. It was submitted that this was not a case where the approach permitted by the principles stated in O’Leary applied.  
     
      
    48 The Crown, at trial, proposed to rely upon the evidence in relation to count 4 to prove, that in respect of counts 1, 2 and 3, the appellants had an intention to steal, notwithstanding that there was no evidence of any property having been stolen. It was proposed to prove that intention from the circumstances surrounding the interaction of the complainants with the appellants, as well as the circumstances surrounding the offence and actual theft of property from the complainant in count 4. It will be remembered that the incidents in counts 1, 2 and 3 and in count 4 occurred on the same night and within a relatively short time of each other.  
     
      
    49 The Crown relied upon the principles stated in O’Leary as permitting it to pursue that course. The principle had earlier been stated by the High Court in Martin v Osborne [1936] HCA 23; (1936) 55 CLR 367. In that case, Dixon J, with whom Latham CJ agreed, stated, at 375: 
     
      
       
        
        “If an issue is to be proved by circumstantial evidence, facts subsidiary to or connected with the main fact must be established from which the conclusion follows as a rational inference. In the inculpation of an accused person the evidentiary circumstances must bear no other reasonable explanation. This means that, according to the common course of human affairs, the degree of probability that the occurrence of the facts proved would be accompanied by the occurrence of the fact to be proved is so high that the contrary cannot reasonably be supposed.  
        The circumstances which may be taken into account in this process of reasoning include all facts and matters which form constituent parts or ingredients of the transaction itself or explain or make intelligible the course of conduct pursued 
        .” (Emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    50 In O’Leary, the appellant was convicted of a murder which was committed on 7 July 1946. A question arose as to the admissibility of evidence of assaults upon other persons committed by the accused on 6 and 7 July 1946. Those assaults were violent and unprovoked and the victims were fellow employees of both the appellant and the man killed. The victim had been struck violently on the head about eight or nine times and then kerosene had been poured on him and his clothes set on fire. Evidence of the other assaults was admitted at trial upon the grounds that the attack upon the deceased was brutally violent, that the deceased was drunk and helpless at the time and that the injuries had been inflicted to the head. The two former characteristics were present in the case of the other assaults proved and in one or two of them there were head injuries. The evidence had been admitted as similar evidence of acts which showed more than a general disposition to violence or his bad character.  
     
      
    51 This basis of admissibility was rejected by the High Court. However, there was an alternate basis upon which it was held to be admissible. Dixon J stated, at [577]-[578]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The evidence disclosed that, under the influence of the beer and wine he had drunk and continued to drink, he engaged in repeated acts of violence which might be regarded as amounting to a connected course of conduct. Without evidence of what, during that time, was done by those men who took any significant part in the matter and especially evidence of the behaviour of the prisoner, the transaction of which the alleged murder formed an integral part could not be truly understood and, isolated from it, could only be presented as an unreal and not very intelligible event. The prisoner's generally violent and hostile conduct might well serve to explain his mind and attitude and, therefore, to implicate him in the resulting homicide. Examples of the admission of evidence of connected incidents of one transaction will be found in  
        R. v. Cobden  
        (1862) 3 F. & F. 833 [176 E.R. 381];  
        R. v. Voke  
        (1823) Russ. & Ry. 531, at p. 533 [168 E.R. 934, at p. 935];  
        R. v. Rearden  
        (1864) 4 F. & F. 76 [176 E.R. 473], and as to this case see per  
        Cussen 
         J. in  
        R. v. Herbert  
        (1916) V.L.R. 343, at p. 349.” 
        
       
      
    52 Latham CJ rejected the basis upon which the evidence had been admitted at trial. He said, at 574-575, that it would be a dangerous extension of the principles relating to the admissibility of similar fact evidence to hold that the circumstance that a crime was savage and brutal was sufficient to justify evidence that on other occasions the accused had been guilty of savage and brutal acts. The Chief Justice considered, however, that there was another basis upon which the evidence was admissible. After referring to the fact that all the assaults were incidents in a drunken orgy that took place over the course of the evening of 6 July and the early hours of 7 July, his Honour said that such evidence “was admissible to show the probability that [the accused] would attack another man in a fit of drunken fury”. Evidence that the accused had actually attacked particular fellow employees without cause during this period was also evidence showing the probability that he would attack some other fellow employee. His Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Such evidence puts the act of attacking [the victim] in a setting which makes it possible for the jury to obtain a real appreciation of the events of the day and the night. It is evidence of ‘facts and matters which form constituent parts or ingredients of the transaction itself or explain or make intelligible the course of conduct pursued.’—per Dixon J. in  
        Martin v. Osborne 
        .” (Citation omitted) 
        
       
      
    53 The principle stated by Dixon J in O’Leary was considered by this Court in R v Adam [1999] NSWCCA 189; (1999) 47 NSWLR 267; 106 A Crim R 510. There, the Court, constituted by Spigelman CJ, James and Bell JJ (as her Honour then was), were concerned with an appeal from a murder conviction of an off-duty police officer. The appeal was allowed, but on a point not concerned with the Court’s comments relating to O’Leary. In Adam, evidence had been admitted at trial that the accused, some time before the first stage of the attack on the deceased, had been staring at one of the patrons at the tavern where the murder occurred. In his address to the jury, the Crown had referred to this incident, stating, “there is aggressiveness, it is not as if they are just peace loving types”. The comment was made in respect of the accused and one other person. 
     
      
    54 On the appeal in Adam, it was submitted that this evidence was admissible as tending to show the accused’s state of mind at the time of the offence. It was also submitted that it was admissible under the principles stated in O’Leary, namely, that the accused’s conduct “formed an integral part of a ‘transaction’ consisting of connected events, including both phases of the attack on [the deceased]”. It was argued on the appeal that the principle of the admissibility of evidence stated in O’Leary had been abolished by the Evidence Act. This argument was rejected (see at [24] ff).  
     
      
    55 It had also been argued that evidence of that incident was “tendency evidence” within Pt 36 of the Evidence Act and was not admissible to prove the accused had a tendency to act in a particular way, or had a particular state of mind, because the preconditions for the admission of such evidence under the Act had not been satisfied. The Court, at [27], said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If evidence of the appellant staring at Dennis Oshana was an integral part of a connected series of events happening on the night of 18 April 1997, which included the assaulting of David Carty and which could not be truly understood without reference to the evidence (that is, if the evidence came within the  
        O’Leary 
         principle) or if the evidence of the appellant staring at Dennis Oshana was evidence of conduct by the appellant at a time sufficiently proximate to the time of the alleged assaulting of David Carty to permit an inference to be drawn that the appellant had the same continuing state of mind at the time of the alleged assaulting of David Carty as he had at the time of the staring, then such evidence would not, in our opinion, be tendency evidence within Pt36.” 
        
       
      
    56 The Court noted, however, that there would have been a serious question in the case whether evidence that at some indeterminate time prior to the assault of the deceased, the appellant had stared, even hostilely, at some other person in the tavern, would be admissible on the bases in O’Leary and the other bases upon which the Crown had relied. However, the jury had been appropriately directed that that incident was of no moment and that they should not draw any inference from it: see also R v Player [2000] NSWCCA 123 at [14]-[16]. 
     
      
    57 In the matter presently before the Court, the trial judge ruled that the evidence on count 4 was admissible in respect of counts 1-3 in accordance with the principles in O’Leary. Her Honour’s reasoning was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that in the case before me the evidence surrounding count 4 indeed is evidence so close both in time and physically to the other three that it can be said to be part of the same transaction and the circumstances surrounding count 4 are relevantly admissible to explain and prove the state of mind of the [appellants] at the time they were with the first three complainants and to be used by the jury to draw the inferences the Crown will ask them to draw, both in relation to intention to steal and the administration of the drug Clonazepam based on the reportedly described symptoms.”  
        
       
      
    58 The appellants contended that this evidence was not so . They submitted that the incidents are quite different transactions. In incident 1, two women were involved (in fact, it was two women and one man). In incident 2, a homosexual man was involved. It was submitted that mere temporal proximity was not a legitimate basis for admission. Further, it was submitted that simply because two events could be characterised as involving the same two men drugging two sets of victims on the same night, it was not indicative of both events being part of the same transaction.  
     
      
    59 It was also submitted that when regard was had to the use to be made of the evidence relating to incident 2, it was to prove the appellants’ intention to enable each appellant to commit the indictable offence of stealing property. It was submitted that such reasoning in this case was flawed, because there was a more compelling inference, or at least, an equally available inference, that the intention could have been of an attempt to sexually or indecently assault the female victims.  
     
      
    60 It was also submitted that incident 2 was quite different in that the drink spiking took place in the victim’s home, whereas in incident 1, the drink spiking had occurred at a bar. 
     
      
    61 The Crown contended that her Honour had correctly admitted the evidence in respect of incident 2 as evidence relating to the counts arising out of incident 1, within the principles of O’Leary. Three matters were in issue in the counts arising out of each of those incidents: first, the identity of the offenders; secondly, whether the offenders had administered a stupefying drug to the victims; and thirdly, the intention of those offenders when doing so.  
     
      
    62 The Crown submitted that given the following matters, the evidence was admissible in accordance with the principles in O’Leary. First, both incidents involved the same two offenders. Secondly, both incidents were integral parts of a connected chain of events involving the appellants at and about the vicinity of the Pontoon Bar at around midnight on 13-14 October. Incident 2 began almost immediately upon the cessation of incident 1, in the vicinity of the Pontoon Bar, where SM was approached by the appellants. Finally, the Crown contended that incident 1 could only be presented as an “unreal and not very intelligible event” without: (1) forensic evidence that the appellants had administered Clonazepam to SM, the victim in incident 2, thereby providing an appropriate evidentiary basis for the inference the appellants had also administered that drug to the victims in incident 1; and (2) the evidence that the appellants had done so to enable the larceny of the property of SM provided an appropriate evidentiary basis for the inference that the appellants had similarly administered the drug to the victims of incident 1 to enable the larceny of their property. 
     
      
    63 In my opinion, there was no error in the trial judge permitting the evidence in respect of count 4 to be admitted to explain and prove the state of mind of the appellants at the time they were with the complainants in incident 1 and to be used by the jury to draw the inference, both in relation to the intention to steal and the administration of the drug Clonazepam, based upon their symptoms. Had the jury been instructed that the evidence in incident 2 was not part of the same overall circumstances, incident 1 would, in my opinion, be, as was said in O’Leary, “an unreal and not very intelligible event”. It would simply be an event where persons had some wrong purpose.  
     
      
    64 The question then becomes whether the relevant intention for the purposes of s 38 could be inferred, or whether, as was submitted by the appellants, the more compelling, or at least equally available inference, was that the appellants intended to sexually assault the women. In my opinion, the relevant intention for the purposes of s 38 could be inferred from the circumstances proved in respect of count 4. However, even if there was arguably more than one intention operating on the minds of the appellants at the time that they spiked the drinks, that does not mean that the Crown could not restrict its case and allege an offence in respect of one of those intentions. Not does it diminish the force of the evidence that that on that night, the appellants were involved in a process of spiking the victims’ drinks for the purpose of committing an indictable offence which was to enable them to steal, even if they may also have had some other intention, such as, for example, to commit a sexual offence. Accordingly, this ground of appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      The trial judge’s coincidence ruling: Samadi appeal: ground 1; Djait appeal: ground 11 
       
       
      Alleged error in directions given in respect of coincidence evidence: Samadi appeal ground 11; Djait appeal ground 12 
       
      
    65 The appellants contend her Honour erred in admitting into evidence pursuant to s 98 of the Evidence Act the evidence of all counts under s 38 in consideration of each other. 
     
      
    66 Section 98 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        The coincidence rule 
         
         
        (1) Evidence that 2 or more related events occurred is not admissible to prove that, because of the improbability of the events occurring coincidentally, a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind if:  
         
         
          
          (a) the party adducing the evidence has not given reasonable notice in writing to each other party of the party’s intention to adduce the evidence, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the court thinks that the evidence would not, either by itself or having regard to other evidence adduced or to be adduced by the party seeking to adduce the evidence, have significant probative value. 
          
         
         
        (2) For the purposes of subsection (1), 2 or more events are taken to be related events if and only if:  
         
         
        (a) they are substantially and relevantly similar, and 
         
         
          
          (b) the circumstances in which they occurred are substantially similar. 
          
         
         
        (3) Subsection (1) (a) does not apply if:  
         
         
          
          (a) the evidence is adduced in accordance with any directions made by the court under section 100, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the evidence is adduced to explain or contradict coincidence evidence adduced by another party.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    67 The Crown had given the notice required by the section. 
     
      
    68 In R v Zhang [2005] NSWCCA 437; 158 A Crim R 504 Simpson J observed, at [141], that a determination under s 98 “is essentially evaluative and predictive” and requires an assessment upon which “reasonable minds may differ”: see also R v Fletcher [2005] NSWCCA 338; 156 A Crim R 308 at [32]-[35]. 
     
      
    69 The trial judge in this case identified 13 similarities between the s 38 counts on the indictment and concluded that those similarities were sufficient to meet the requirements of s 98 in the circumstances as they applied at the time the application was made to her, that is, on a pre-trial application. Those 13 similarities were: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. That the events all occurred at more or less the same time, namely over six days between 13 and 19 October. The evidence would seem to be capable of proving that. It seems to me that these are similarities. 
         
         
        2. That the offences all involved two men. 
         
         
        3. That the descriptions given by the twelve complainants are of two men and the descriptions are similar. 
         
         
        4. In each offence it was one or other of the two accused who initiated contact with the complainant or complainants. 
         
         
        5. All offences either occurred or commenced at or near a bar. 
         
         
        6. All of the bars were within close proximity to each other in the Sydney CBD between Liverpool Street, Darling Harbour and Circular Quay. 
         
         
        7. The drug Clonazepam was used in all cases, which the Crown will seek to prove either by direct evidence of a finding of that drug in the blood or urine of a complainant in four of the six incidents or by inference on the basis of described symptoms and expert evidence. 
         
         
        8. All complainants described suffering the same debilitating and stupefying symptoms. 
         
         
        9. In all cases one or other of the accused had access to drinks consumed by the complainants out of the sight of that complainant, even if for a short period. 
         
         
        10. In five of the six incidents there was property stolen from the complainants. 
         
         
        11. In most of the cases the two accused used the names Andy or Dylan which are not their names. 
         
         
        12. In most of the incidents the complainants were apparently tourists either international or interstate and/or foreigners including Asian women, a Swedish woman, a Swiss man. 
         
         
        13. In five of the six incidents one or other of the accused bought drinks for the complainants or it could be inferred that this occurred, that latter being the sixth incident. The remaining incident is count 4 in which there is no evidence in relation to that but which, following an order I have already made, will be heard together with counts 1, 2 and 3.” 
        
       
      
    70 At the time her Honour was dealing with this application, each element of the offence was in issue, including identification. Her Honour referred to Zhang, noting that her task was an “evaluative and predictive one”. Her Honour considered the circumstances surrounding each offence were “so strikingly and substantially similar” that the similarities were capable of being “rationally probative of the guilt of [the appellants]” or, alternatively, “rationally probative of the relevant facts in issue to prove the guilt of [the appellants] in relation to each of the other offences”.  
     
      
    71 The appellants contend that the evidence in respect of the s 38 counts were not each so strikingly similar with respect to their facts such as to demonstrate that it was the intention of the appellants jointly and/or individually to steal from the victims, as contended on the Crown case. This submission accepted that there was, or at least may have been, a striking similarity in relation to the identification of the appellants and the fact that either together, or one or other of them, administered the stupefying drug Clonazepam. Notwithstanding these similarities, it was submitted that the evidence was not properly admitted as coincidence evidence. Alternatively, it was submitted the evidence was not available as coincidence evidence, because its probative value did not substantially outweigh its prejudicial effect: see the Evidence Act, s 101(2).  
     
      
    72 The appellants accepted that the evidence upon some of the counts was probative of the fact that one or both of them had drugged the victims to steal their property, but that this was not the case in relation to all counts. In some counts, for example count 16, the evidence was probative of the fact that one of the appellants, with or without the knowledge of the other, used the fact that the victims had been drugged to sexually assault them. It was submitted, however, that except for incident 2, which gave rise to count 4, the various incidents could be seen to be probative of the intention of the appellants, either jointly or individually, to steal or sexually assault the victims. It was submitted that in this regard, they were not strikingly similar. The point of this submission was to contradict the Crown’s argument that it was the intention of both appellants to steal from the victims by drugging them. It was said that this was not the only logical inference, nor was it a striking similarity to be inferred from all of the incidents. 
     
      
    73 Coincidence evidence may be led to prove that a person did a particular act or had a particular state of mind. As I have stated, there were 13 similarities found by the trial judge on the s 98 application. The relevant similarity under discussion at the moment was that property had been stolen from victims in five of the six incidents. There was proof that some of the items stolen in those five incidents were located in the possession of one or other of the appellants. There was also the use of a credit card shortly after the time of the association between the appellants and the victim. In my opinion, the circumstances of the s 38 offences were substantially and relevantly similar and the circumstances in which they occurred were substantially similar. Those substantial similarities were identified by her Honour and I would agree that they each satisfied the test of being “related events” for the purposes of s 98.  
     
      
    74 This is so notwithstanding that in respect of counts 1-3, being the counts that arose from incident 1, there was no theft of property. Nonetheless, I consider it was open to her Honour to say that there was such a stark similarity between those offences, in time, place and methodology, that the similarity between those matters where property was stolen and counts 1-3, were probative of the appellants having the intention to enable the larceny of the property of the victims in all of the s 38 counts. It does not matter, in my opinion, that it might also be argued that there could have been some additional wrong intention, such as to sexually assault the victims in the s 38 counts.  
     
      
    75 The appellants, however, contend that when properly analysed, there were significant dissimilarities in the evidence, such that the requirements of s 98 for the admissibility of coincidence evidence have not been satisfied. Further, it was submitted that when the similarities identified by her Honour were properly analysed, there was significant overlapping, so that the “stark similarities” were not as numerous as her Honour identified. 
     
      
    76 It is convenient to deal with the analysis of the similarities first. The first similarity was that all the events occurred at more or less the same time, that is, between 13 and 19 October. The appellants take no point in respect of that matter. It was submitted that the second, third and eleventh items were correctly identified as one matter and not three. Those matters were: that the offences all involved two men: item (2); that the descriptions given by the twelve complainants are of two men and the descriptions were similar: item (3); and, in most cases, the two appellants used the names “Andy” and “Dylan”, which are not their names: item (11). In my opinion, it is of little importance whether these matters are identified as components of one item, or separately. The fact is there were three relevant similarities: (1) that two men were involved; (2) that the descriptions of those men were similar in each count; and (3) that they used the same pseudonyms.  
     
      
    77 No complaint is made about any doubling up with item (4), which, it was accepted, stood on its own. It was then said that items (5) and (6) in her Honour’s list amounted to the same thing. Again, the same point can be made, namely, whether one itemises these two together or separately, they contain two quite distinct components, namely, that the offence was initiated at or near a bar and those bars were within close proximity to each other. 
     
      
    78 It was alleged that items (7) and (8) also amounted to one similarity, namely the use of the drug Clonazepam. There is an initial attraction in the argument that there was no differentiation between these items. However, properly analysed, each deals with a different aspect of the same circumstance. Item (7) relates to the actual drug used; item (8) deals with the symptoms each victim described. The relevance of the separate identification of the symptoms the complainants experienced is that it was probative that the complainants were unaware that either the s 38 offences or the sexual assault offences were occurring. The drug used also forms a basis for the inference that explains the symptoms experienced by those complainants who did not undergo a blood or urine test. 
     
      
    79 The next items said to amount to a single similarity were items (9) and (13), relating to the opportunity to spike the victims’ drinks. In my opinion, these two items again differentiate aspects relating to the immediate drink spiking: item (13) relates to the purchasing of drinks (other than in respect of count 4); item (9) relates to an opportunity to spike the drink. In my opinion, they are quite independent factors and were properly identified separately. 
     
      
    80 Item (10) was that in five of the six incidents, there was property stolen from the complainants. The appellants complain that other than for property alleged to have been stolen from RW (count 8), the stolen property was found in the possession of Djait and not Samadi. However, the Crown case based on the s 38 counts was of a joint criminal enterprise. It is not relevant, therefore, that more stolen property was found in the possession of one only of the appellants. The similarity relied upon was that property was stolen, not who retained possession of that property.  
     
      
    81 As will appear from the comments I have made in analysing the above, I am of the opinion that her Honour correctly identified the similarities and that it is irrelevant, in assessing such evidence as to whether it should be characterised as one similarity with a number of features or separate features, or whether the separate features should, or may be, separately identified. The appellants’ point seems to have been that if the number of similarities could be reduced, either the ‘stark’ coincidence was reduced, or perhaps, more likely, that there were not sufficient similarities to amount to coincidence evidence. For the reasons I have given, neither of those points has been made out.  
     
      
    82 The appellants then argued that there were significant dissimilarities in the various incidents and had those been analysed, her Honour would not have found that the similarities were sufficient, when weighed with the dissimilarities, to fall within s 98.  
     
      
    83 The first, and most obvious dissimilarity upon which the appellants relied, was that there were two occasions of sexual assault, which did not occur in the other cases. It could not be said, therefore, on this argument, that the evidence in each count was strikingly similar.  
     
      
    84 Next, it was argued that in counts 1-3, there was no evidence of the victims being stolen from or sexually assaulted. It was argued that, as the victims in counts 1-3 were significantly affected by some intoxicating agent, it would have been an easy matter for the appellants to steal from them, or to separate the women from the man for the purposes of engaging in non-consensual sexual activity. It was submitted that JA was in such a condition that he would not have been able to protect the two women. Accordingly, it was said there was no coincidence in the circumstances of these two incidents.  
     
      
    85 I do not agree. In the first place it is speculative. But in any event, for evidence to be admitted as coincidence evidence under s 98, there does not have to be an exact parallel of circumstances. Indeed, part of the purpose of coincidence evidence is to facilitate the proof of a circumstantial case. Further, not only do the similarities not have to be identical, there were 13 similarities, many of which were to be found in counts 1-3. The other aspects of the coincidence evidence were available in relation to incident 1. The similarity of the other factors permitted an inference to be drawn that the intention of the drink spiking in respect of incident 1 was to steal from the victims. Further, the fact that there were dissimilarities does not of itself mean that evidence in the various counts could not be used as coincidence evidence in respect of each of the other counts. Nor does it matter, in my opinion, that arguably the appellants might have had more than one intention in the administration of the drug.  
     
      
    86 The appellants further contend that the Crown case based upon the 13 similarities is further flawed when regard is had to the sexual assault counts, counts 12-14, arising out of incident 5. The Crown case in respect of those counts was that Djait had taken advantage of HA’s drugged state to sexually assault her. The appellants say that it is simply not open to the Crown to rely upon the theft of HA’s camera as being the original intention in that case. It was possible that the theft of the camera may simply have been an afterthought, having effected the original purpose of sexual assault. It was also submitted there could possibly have been two purposes involved in the drink spiking incident: one, to sexually assault and two, to steal from the victim. Alternatively, it may have been that Djait’s original intention was to sexually assault HA and that he took the camera to remove potential identification evidence, which might have been disclosed by photographs taken on the camera whilst they were together at the Shark Bar. It was submitted, therefore, that it was at the most, mere conjecture that Djait’s intention when drugging the victims involved in incident 5 was either jointly or separately to steal from them. It was submitted the most compelling inference was that he intended to sexually assault one of the young women. It followed on this argument that an intention to steal was not a striking similarity with all the other offences and certainly not the case in respect of counts 1-3. 
     
      
    87 This argument has already been answered above. It does not matter that there may have been more than one intention operating. Provided that the Crown establishes on the relevant standard of proof that the appellants had the intention to steal, being the offence with which they were charged, then any argument about some other intention becomes irrelevant. 
     
      
    88 The appellants next submitted that the evidence relating to incident 2 (count 4) was different not only from incident 1, but all other incidents, because it involved a homosexual man. The other incidents all involved young women. Further, this incident did not involve buying the victim alcoholic drinks, nor did it involve buying him drinks in a bar. Nor did the incident take place in a bar involving, or likely to attract, tourists. Accordingly, it was argued, incident 1 could not be used as coincidence evidence arising out of count 2, giving rise to count 4, nor could the evidence in relation to count 4 be relied upon as coincidence evidence of any of the other counts.  
     
      
    89 The answer to this complaint is the same as that which has already been given above. There were two significant dissimilarities arising from count 4, namely, that the complainant was a homosexual man, and he was not approached in a bar and drinks were not purchased for him in a bar or elsewhere. The incident occurred in the complainant’s unit. Nonetheless, there were other substantial similarities which were sufficient such that the evidence of the counts could be admitted as coincidence evidence in respect of the others. For instance, the appellants befriended the complainant outside the Pontoon Bar, located within the tourist precinct of Darling Harbour, immediately after parting from TV, PD and JA, and suggesting that they share a drink with the complainant. It is also noted that in respect of incidents 3 and 4, the appellants went to the complainant’s residential address, and no sexual assault occurred. Rather, property of the complainants was subsequently found to be missing. 
     
      
    90 The appellants next submit that in respect of incident 5, counts 9-11, it is not relevant that property was stolen from the other two victims, that is HMK and JH (being the victims who were not subject of the sexual assault), because it was possible that the appellants might have had different intentions each to the other, one, that Djait’s intention may have been to sexually assault the victim, whereas the intention in relation to the other two victims may have been larceny. The difficulty with this submission, however, is that all three victims had property that was missing the day after they had been drinking with the appellants. To the extent the appellants advance a number of other possibilities, such as that the victims may have spent the money that was allegedly stolen, or lost the other items such as the wallet and phone, given their drug-affected states, these are merely speculative matters. There was no evidence suggesting that any of these possibilities had or might have occurred.  
     
      
    91 Where the Crown case was that the appellants drugged the victims to thereby steal from them, it is irrelevant that the complainant in incident 2 was homosexual. In any event, the Crown summary of trial indicated that there was evidence to suggest that one of the appellants had indicated to the complainant that they were likewise of homosexual orientation, presumably to befriend the complainant. 
     
      
    92 The appellants advance similar arguments in respect of incident 3. In particular, it was submitted that it was possible that the purpose of the appellants’ actions in drugging the drink of KH was for the purposes of engaging in sexual conduct with her, either consensual or non-consensual. In support of this argument, the appellants point out that there was no property stolen from her. However, to the extent that the Crown placed reliance upon the fact that there was property stolen from her companion, TM, being the complainant in respect of count 6, it did not support an inference that there was an intention to steal from her. It was argued that it was possible the appellants’ intention was to engage in sexual conduct with TM and that Djait thereafter took the opportunity to steal from her. Whatever the position, it was argued there were a number of available interpretations of their joint or individual intentions, but no facts from which it could be clearly inferred their joint or individual intentions with respect to the other incidents.  
     
      
    93 Similar arguments are made in respect of incident 4, where YS and RW were accompanied by the appellants to their respective apartments. Only RW reported any of her property missing.  
     
      
    94 Finally, regarding incident 6, the appellants submitted that the most compelling inference available, if it was accepted that the appellant was involved in drugging HI, was that he did so in order to thereafter sexually assault her. It was submitted that although HI did lose some property, the evidence did not disclose the appellants being involved with the missing property. Therefore, it was submitted that the events were more consistent with an intention to sexually or indecently assault the victim. 
     
      
    95 In my opinion, the similarities identified by her Honour were also applicable to incident 6: the timeframe; the manner of befriending HI, a Swedish national; and inviting her to lunch at Opera Bar, a bar and tourist precinct, where it could be reasonably inferred that alcoholic beverages were purchased for HI by the appellants. The same stupefying symptoms associated with Clonazepam were also experienced by HI. If the sole intention was to have sexual relations with HI, against this inference is that the evidence showed that whilst Samadi pursued HI alone, Djait later joined Samadi and HI at Opera Bar.  
     
      
    96 These might be arguments that were available to counsel in their addresses to the jury. However, as I have already indicated, the trial judge was dealing with a pre-trial application to determine whether or not this evidence could be admitted as coincidence evidence. The similarities were sufficient for the evidence to be admitted on that basis. 
     
      
    97 Whilst an array of circumstances might be posited against the availability of drawing an inference, s 98, at the admissibility level, does not work in that way. The Court is concerned with determining whether evidence is substantially and relevantly similar and occurred in substantially similar circumstances, so that those events may be relied upon to prove, if accepted, that it is improbable that the events occurred coincidentally. In determining that question, the Court is not required to engage in a imaginative task of speculating what possible other explanations there could be for the circumstances relied upon.  
     
      
    98 The appellant also contends that the s 98 application should have been refused because the probative value of the evidence could not be found to substantially outweigh any prejudicial effect: see s 101 of the Evidence Act. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        101 Further restrictions on tendency evidence and coincidence evidence adduced by prosecution 
         
         
        (1) This section only applies in a criminal proceeding and so applies in addition to sections 97 and 98. 
         
         
        (2) Tendency evidence about a defendant, or coincidence evidence about a defendant, that is adduced by the prosecution cannot be used against the defendant unless the probative value of the evidence substantially outweighs any prejudicial effect it may have on the defendant. 
         
        …. 
        
       
      
    99 The appellants contended that that there was a risk that the jury would be convinced, by the sheer number of counts alone, that the appellants must be guilty.  
     
      
    100 The trial judge understood that this argument was advanced not only on the basis that the coincidence evidence should be rejected because of its prejudicial value, but also to support the argument that the counts in the indictment be severed. In her judgment of 27 January 2009 at [16], her Honour acknowledged that there was a potential prejudice in that a jury might use the number of counts to reason that the appellants must be guilty, rather than properly using the coincidence evidence on the basis of its similarities or, for that matter, assessing what might be thought to be the dissimilarities in the evidence.  
     
      
    101 Her Honour said that such a prejudice arose in any trial where there were a number of counts being tried together. Her Honour concluded, however, that the similarities amongst the incidents were so striking that any prejudice could be cured by a direction to the jury that they would not be entitled to reason in such a way. Her Honour also considered that notwithstanding there was a possibility of such prejudice, it was substantially outweighed by the probative value of the similarity of these incidents. 
     
      
    102 In my opinion, her Honour, having recognised the potential prejudice, gave appropriate directions to the jury. In any event, the appellants’ contention that the jury was likely to be persuaded by the sheer number of counts fails to grapple with the reality of the circumstances of the case. Whilst there were a large number of counts, those counts arose out of six incidents. The number of counts would not, in my opinion, lead a jury, properly applying its mind to the task, to reason that simply because there were a number of incidents with striking similarities, that the appellants must be guilty of all offences. There were distinct issues relating to each count. For example, Samadi’s identification was in issue in each count; the question of consent was in issue in the sexual assault count; the question of theft was in issue in the s 38 counts. The jury were given appropriate directions, about which, I should add, there was no complaint. In my opinion, this ground has not been made out.  
     
      
       
      Failure to order separate trials: Samadi appeal grounds 3-10; Djait appeal grounds 1-6 and 8-9 
       
       
      Alleged error in directions given in respect of consideration of the evidence relating to sexual assault: Djait appeal ground 10 
       
      
    103 The appellants make three complaints in respect of her Honour’s refusal to order that there be separate trials in respect of the various counts. 
     
      
    104 First, they contend that there should have been separate trials in respect of the s 38 counts arising out of each incident. They acknowledge that it was appropriate that they be tried jointly in respect of such offences: Samadi grounds 3-10; Djait grounds 1-6 and 8-9. 
     
      
    105 Secondly, they contend that her Honour should have ordered that there be a separate trial on counts 1-3 from the other counts on the indictment. The appellants again acknowledged that it would be appropriate that such separate trial be held jointly between them: Samadi ground 3; Djait ground 1. 
     
      
    106 Thirdly, they contend that the sexual assault counts should have been heard separately from each other and separately from all other counts on the indictment: Samadi grounds 9-10; Djait grounds 8-9. Further, the appellants submitted that her Honour erred in her directions to the jury regarding the use the jury could make of the evidence admitted pursuant to s 98 of the Evidence Act: Samadi grounds 9-11; Djait ground 10. 
     
      
    107 In their written submissions, the appellants indicated that the first and second of these complaints could conveniently be dealt with together. However, on the hearing of the appeal, the emphasis was upon the second complaint, relating to counts 1-3, for obvious reasons. Separate arguments were advanced in respect of the third of these complaints.  
     
      
    108 The question of whether there should be joint or separate trials is a matter for discretion for the judge at the trial: see R v Grondkowski; R v Malinowski [1946] 1 KB 369; [1946] 1 All ER 559; Merritt v Roso (1985) 19 A Crim R 360 at 364. The discretion must be exercised judicially and not capriciously, having regard to the interests of justice as well as the interests of the accused: see Slattery CJ in CL and Carruthers J at 364.  
     
      
    109 The appellants frankly conceded that the success of the grounds that relate to the first and second question depended upon the Court’s determination in respect of whether there was error in permitting evidence in relation to the different incidents in respect of the s 38 counts as coincidence evidence pursuant to s 98. They also conceded that the success of these grounds was dependent upon the determination of ground 2, relating to the application of O’Leary. As I have concluded these matters against the appellants, these grounds should be determined against the appellants.  
     
      
    110 Accordingly, I consider that Samadi grounds 3-8 and Djait grounds 1-6 should be rejected.  
     
      
    111 The trial judge refused the application that the sexual assault counts be heard separately from the s 38 counts and separately in respect of each appellant. Her Honour’s ruling on this was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “They are not joint counts … the evidence in relation to the connected s 38 offence for each of these two sexual assault charges would be admissible and in fact inextricably linked as evidence of knowledge of lack of consent in the sexual assault offence involving the same complainant. For each sexual assault offence the Crown would be entitled to lead evidence of events immediately before the alleged sexual assault to prove that the [appellant] in each case, if the jury were satisfied he had been involved in spiking the drink of the complainant, must have known that she was not consenting. Thus, in the absence of any unfair prejudice to one or other of the [appellants], it is appropriate that each sexual assault charge, at the least be heard together with the relevantly connected s 38 charge, even though the sexual assault offences involve one appellant only. Each of the [appellants] has identified what is said to be an unfair prejudice flowing from the sexual assault offences being heard together with s 38 offences or, for that matter, being heard together in one overall trial. Each of them … argues that to hear the sexual assault offence at the same time as the relevantly connected s 38 offence would give rise to an unfair prejudice to the extent that a jury would be, even if satisfied that the sexual assault offence occurred, prejudiced against the [appellants] and use that alone, impermissibly, to reason that he must have committed the connected s 38 offence. 
         
         
        It seems to me that any such prejudice and I acknowledge it is a possibility – that any such prejudice can nonetheless be cured by a direction to the jury that they are in fact not entitled to use the evidence in that way and to that extent it seems to me that that prejudice would not be unfair. 
         
         
        As a corollary, as I understand it, each of the appellants argues that to face a trial in which the other is charged with a sexual assault offence which does not involve him would give rise to a similar sort of prejudice, namely, allowing the jury to reason impermissibly that if in fact they were satisfied that they were acting in a joint criminal enterprise in the s 38 offences and one of them committed a sexual assault offence, that therefore the other would be more likely to commit another and unconnected sexual assault offence. 
         
         
        Again, it seems to me that such a prejudice is a possibility but again it seems to me that such a possibility is capable of being cured by appropriate direction to the jury.” (Taken from Samadi submissions 18-20) 
        
       
      
    112 Her Honour had been referred to De Jesus v R [1986] HCA 65; 61 ALJR 1, but considered that case did not apply. Her Honour said that in De Jesus, there was: 
     
      
       
        
        “… no connection or commonality between the facts involved in each of the two sexual assault offences. 
         
         
        That is not the case here. The situation would be that there would be one sexual assault charge heard against one [appellant] at the same time as a different sexual assault charge was heard against the other [appellant]. There is nothing in the Crown case to suggest an involvement one with the other in relation to those sexual assault offences and, as I have said, it seems to me that any impermissible reasoning by the jury in relation to either that or the increased likelihood of either or both of them having committed the s 38 offences can be cured by an appropriate direction to the jury.”  
        
       
      
    113 In her summing up to the jury, her Honour gave the following directions: 
     
      
       
        
        “Before I move onto the next section of the summing up, there is one direction I will give you which is relevant to all of the sexual assault offences charged separately against one or other of the [appellants]. There is a body of evidence which the Crown relies on which is relevant and admissible to prove these sexual assault offences, but it is only admissible against the [appellant] to whom it, in fact, relates. 
         
         
        All of the evidence which the Crown relies on to prove the sexual assault charges against [Djait] involving [HA], the circumstances of her getting home with him in a taxi, what occurred in his unit when they got there, the evidence of the sexual activities in the unit, what happened the next day and any evidence that relates to those three charges is only relevant in relation to [Djait] in this trial and not relevant in this trial, in any way, against [Samadi] either in relation to the sexual assault charge that he faces, as a sole charge, or in relation to any of the drink spiking charges where he is jointly charged with [Djait]. Similarly, the evidence that the Crown relies on to prove the sexual assault charge against [Samadi], that is getting to the Highfield Hotel, going to [HI’s] room, what happened inside, what happened afterwards, the forensic and medical evidence involving her sexual assault examination, including swabs and the like, is admissible and relevant to prove the sexual assault charge against [Samadi], but cannot be used in any way by you against [Djait] in relation to his sexual assault charges except in a way that I will come to explain later, perhaps in relation to the evidence of how Samadi got to the Highfield Hotel with [HI] and what you find occurred there. Nor can any of that evidence be used against [Djait] in relation to any of the drink spiking charges where he is jointly charged with [Samadi]. 
         
         
        Furthermore, even if you ultimately accept that one or both of the [appellants] in fact did sexually assault the relevant complainant, you must not use that fact in a way which is adverse to the other [appellant], to reason, for example, that if one or other of them in fact sexually assaulted a complainant, then they are people who are more likely to have committed the other offences alleged against them, namely the drink spiking offences. Nor are you entitled to use the evidence in this way, to reason that if you are satisfied that the sexual offences are proved against one or other of the [appellants], where they are charged alone … that it is more likely that the other [appellant] committed the sexual assault offence or offences charged against him. In other words, they are not connected, the sexual assault offences, either one with the other or, except in a way that I will explain later, to the drink spiking offences and you are not entitled to use against the other [appellant], the evidence in relation to the sexual assault as alleged by the Crown in either the other sexual assault case or, except in the way I will come to explain, in the drink spiking charges. 
         
         
        There is a connection between the drink spiking offences and the sexual assault offences because, as you know, the complainants in two of the drink spiking charges are the same complainants in four of the sexual assault offences, two sexual assault incidents. The Crown relies on what they say you would accept in the long run, namely that the [appellants] together had administered Clonazepam to these two complainants, [HA] and [HI], and knew that they were suffering the consequences of that drug to prove both lack of consent and knowledge of consent. It is for that reason that the sexual assault offences and the drink spiking offences were heard together in the same trial. They are however, separate charges and you will need to bring in separate verdicts for the separate sexual assault charges. For that matter, also for the other twelve drink spiking offences, but I will say more about that later. It will not necessarily follow that even if you find the relevant [appellants] guilty of the connected drink spiking charge, that you would correspondingly find him guilty of the sexual assault offence involving the same complainant. You would only do so if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the Crown had proved each of the essential elements of the sexual assault offences beyond reasonable doubt.” (Directions 21.03.06) 
        
       
      
    114 The appellants contend that the prejudice in having the sexual assault counts against each appellant heard together and with the other joint enterprise offences was overwhelming, and that the direction given was incapable of curing the prejudice. The particular prejudice identified was that there was likely to have been a cross-contamination of the evidence, both in relation to the sexual assault charges themselves, as well as in respect of the s 38 counts. In particular, it was submitted it was likely the jury would reason that the sexual assault charges were part of the joint enterprise. This was apparent, it was said, because the drink spiking episodes in which both appellants were involved, as part of a joint enterprise, were the circumstances that facilitated the assaults. 
     
      
    115 The trial judge recognised there was a real possibility that the jury could use the evidence in this way and thus engage in impermissible behaviour. Nonetheless, her Honour gave precise directions, explaining to the jury that they were not to engage in that process of reasoning. I refer below to the institutional respect that is afforded to the jury because of the Court’s long experience that juries diligently apply themselves to the task entrusted to them, including following directions given to them by the trial judge. The comments that I make below on this matter also apply here. 
     
      
    116 In my opinion, there was no error in her Honour’s refusal of the application for separate trials in respect of the sexual assault matters. As her Honour pointed out, the Crown would be entitled, and it would be expected that it would, lead evidence in respect of the related s 38 counts. It would follow that it would be likely there would be joint trials at least of those offences, and there would have been no error in her Honour ordering that the sexual assault counts be heard with the related s 38 counts. Once that position is reached, the question becomes whether her Honour erred in ordering that the sexual assault counts be heard together with all the s 38 counts.  
     
      
    117 The underlying principle is whether the appellants could thereby receive a fair trial. As I have said, her Honour was conscious not only of the possibility of some prejudice, but understood precisely what that prejudice was and considered that any possible prejudice could be overcome by appropriate directions to the jury. Her Honour’s directions, which I have set out above were, in my opinion, clear. The jury could have been left with no misapprehension as to the manner in which they were to approach their task in relation to the sexual assault offences; what evidence they were to take into account in respect of each of the sexual assault offences; and what reasoning processes they could and could not engage in. As I consider further below, although this trial had its complexities, the alleged facts relating to each incident were straightforward and distinct. In my opinion, there was no error in her Honour not ordering that there be separate trials of the sexual assault matters. 
     
      
    118 Accordingly, I consider that Samadi grounds 9-10 and Djait grounds 8-9 should also be rejected.  
     
      
       
      Separate ground of appeal in CCA 06/4986: Djait appeal ground 13: the trial judge’s failure to discharge the jury following the fitness trial of Samadi 
       
      
    119 On Monday 13 February 2006, the trial judge released the jury from attendance until Thursday 16 February. Monday 13 February was the ninth day of the trial after the formal empanelment of the jury. In releasing the jury for this period, the trial judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ladies and gentlemen, I’m sorry that you’ve been sitting up there in the jury room for all of today so far. Regrettably, it’s going to take a little longer than just this morning for you to be out of court. There are some issues that have arisen that are going to need my determination, but before I can determine them there are some other matters that I need to take into account and because of the availability of witnesses and the like I’m not going to be able to reach that decision until some time on Wednesday. We’re not going to be able to recommence this trial until Thursday morning as a result of those … legal issues needing to be determined by me. Rather than have you come in every day and sit around a couple of hours to be told we haven’t got anything to do today, I thought it would be better to get you in and tell you that the very real chance is that you won’t be needed until Thursday because of other matters that I’m going to determine. 
         
         
        That being the case, and there’s nothing for you today either, there is still matters that I need to determine. I’m sorry that this has happened. It sometimes does happen in trials. I said to you at the beginning, particularly so in lengthy trials, that these sorts of things are more likely to happen. That being the case, you are now free to go today. You won’t need to come back until Thursday 16 February.”  
        
       
      
    120 The reason for adjourning the proceedings at that stage was because on 10 February, Samadi had made an application that there be an enquiry as to his fitness to stand trial: Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. The application was heard by her Honour on that day, upon which she was concerned to determine whether the application was made in good faith: see s 10(2). Her Honour determined that Samadi ought to be given an opportunity to obtain evidence to support his application that a fitness hearing be conducted.  
     
      
    121 On 14 February 2006, trial counsel for Samadi sought an adjournment until the commencement of the following week, for the purposes of obtaining appropriate psychiatric evidence in addition to that which had already been obtained. Her Honour refused the application and directed that the fitness enquiry commence the next day, 15 February. Her Honour noted for that purpose, a separate jury would be sworn to hear the evidence on the enquiry and make the determination.  
     
      
    122 At the commencement of proceedings on 15 February, her Honour raised the question as to whether she should give reasons as to why she considered a separate jury was required for the fitness hearing. That question had arisen because there was a question whether certain amendments to the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act had come into force. Within what could only have been a minute or two of her Honour raising these matters, trial counsel for Samadi informed her Honour that his instructions were withdrawn. Counsel informed her Honour that his solicitor’s instructions had also been withdrawn but that the solicitor proposed to contact the Legal Aid Commission urgently to try and have someone appointed to represent Samadi as soon as possible. Later in the morning, a Mr Lynch, from the Legal Aid Commission, announced his presence in the Court. Thereafter, there was further discussion about the enquiry as to the fitness hearing. Her Honour eventually stood over the fitness hearing until Monday 20 February. 
     
      
    123 On 20 February 2006, the matter commenced in the absence of the jury. Her Honour commented that she proposed to bring the jury in to inform them that issues had arisen which needed to be determined before the trial could commence. Her Honour was then informed by counsel for Djait that, at an appropriate time, he would make an application for a discharge of the jury. At that point, Mr Lynch made it apparent that he was appearing only as amicus for Samadi and that the jury should not be told he was appearing for Samadi in the trial. The jury were then brought into court and her Honour informed them that, as they would have observed, Samadi’s counsel was no longer at the bar table and that there was a person from the Legal Aid Commission who was present, but in the role of amicus to try and assist with the continuing representation of Samadi. Her Honour informed the jury that the reason for that was of no concern or interest to them and that they were not to speculate about it one way or the other. Her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Its just simply a fact but it means there are some practical difficulties … about taking over at short notice and coming to grips with all of the evidence that’s been heard so far.”  
        
       
      
    124 The fitness trial was conducted over 20 and 21 February and the trial jury returned on 22 February. However, at that point, Samadi had no legal representation, although Mr Lynch again attended court, as amicus.  
     
      
    125 Counsel for Djait made an application that the jury be discharged, given the possible prejudice to Djait due to the time the jury had been out of court. 
     
      
    126 The trial judge refused the application. In her judgment given on 22 February 2006, her Honour outlined the circumstances as to why the trial had been interrupted. Her Honour, at 3, identified the bases upon which the application for the discharge of the jury had been made. The first basis of the application was that the delay of some seven court days (or 10 days including weekends) may have had an impact on the jury’s losing focus on the evidence that had been adduced to date and thus not being in a position to focus on that evidence when the time came for their deliberations. It had been submitted that itself would cause an unfairness to Djait. Her Honour rejected that argument. She acknowledged that it wasn’t the perfect situation for there to be a delay in a trial. Her Honour noted, however, that it was not uncommon in long trials for juries to spend days at a time in a jury room, whilst non-jury issues were being resolved. Her Honour considered that it was relevant that a transcript of all of the evidence would be available to the jury and that counsel would have an appropriate opportunity in their addresses to the jury to refer to whatever portions of the transcript they considered relevant. Her Honour concluded that, although not ideal, the situation was not one requiring the jury to be discharged. She was not satisfied that the jury would have forgotten the evidence and noted that in an eight week trial it was likely the jury would need to be reminded of certain specific aspects of the evidence, even if they had been sitting in the court every day hearing evidence. 
     
      
    127 The second basis advanced in support of the application for discharge was that the jury might speculate adversely to Djait as to the reasons for the delay in the proceedings. Her Honour noted that no specific propositions had been put to support that argument. Her Honour referred to her direction to the jury that they were not to speculate about the fact that Samadi’s legal representation had changed and said that they would also be given an instruction in due course that the delay was not a matter relevant to any issue at the trial and that they ought not speculate about it. Her Honour considered it was hard to see how a jury would form an adverse view of Djait in relation to the delay from the circumstances of which they were aware. She was also satisfied that to the extent they might speculate, any problems arising could be cured by strong directions. As it turned out, the original counsel for Samadi returned to the trial, although the jury was aware that there had been some interruption in relation to Samadi’s legal representation. 
     
      
    128 Although in the written submissions some emphasis was placed upon the fact that the jury would have been confused by the revolving representation for Samadi during this period, the complaint as to her Honour’s refusal to discharge the jury was eventually articulated solely upon the basis that the hiatus in the trial was so substantial, in effect bisecting the evidence, that it was likely that a jury would be affected in their recollection of the evidence. It was also submitted that there was an unfairness in that the evidence in respect of the “weaker counts”, identified as counts 1-4, was given prior to the adjournment and that the evidence on the “stronger counts” was given thereafter. This submission is not entirely correct, as prior to the adjournment, the totality of the evidence had been given in respect of counts 1-9, as well as part of the evidence in respect of counts 15, 16 and 17. The remaining evidence given after the trial resumed was the continuation of the cross-examination of HI and the entirety of the evidence of JH relating to count 10 and of HA in respect of counts 11-14.  
     
      
    129 The Crown contends there was no miscarriage of justice in her Honour refusing the adjournment application. First, it was submitted that her Honour was satisfied that the jury could be appropriately reminded of the evidence by having access to the transcript. Secondly, the jury had been warned they were not to speculate as to the reason for the delay. The Crown also submitted it would have been obvious to the jury, having regard to the changes in legal representation for Samadi, that Djait was not responsible for the hiatus. No adverse impression, therefore, would have been gained by them in respect of Djait’s conduct. Further, the Crown points out that the trial judge gave directions to the jury on their return on 22 February and also gave directions the following day, when the original defence counsel again appeared for Samadi. It is appropriate to consider that direction. 
     
      
    130 The direction by her Honour in respect of the delay was given just before the end of the day on 22 February, when the jury returned and her Honour informed them the trial would commence the following day. The directions were in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The issues that needed to be resolved before we could continue have now been resolved, and all things being equal the trial will resume tomorrow at 10 or not long after 10 with further evidence being called. 
         
         
        I am conscious that it has been a very long break for you and that is not ideal because obviously things aren’t going to be right there at the front of your memory today like they would have been last week. Mind you the things that you heard two weeks ago probably weren’t in the front of your memory last week either. And I already told you at the beginning of the trial there is a transcript of the evidence, and eventually when all of the evidence is finished and you’re asked to consider your verdict, you will have access to that transcript if you want it, or have access to having portions of it read out to you if you wanted it. And for that matter it is normal course that each of the barristers summarises evidence for you from witnesses, and for that matter it is my task to summarise relevant evidence for you from witnesses and to relate that to principles of law. 
         
         
        So, even though there’s been a delay, it seems to me that it is not without an ability to be overcome and we can all be reminded of the evidence. 
         
         
        The other thing I should say was, before you go away this afternoon, is that you must not speculate about what the reason for the delay has been. I mean there could be thousands of different reasons why there is a need for a trial to be delayed during the course of the trial. It can range from the banal and insignificant up to incredible important and complicated issues of law that take a lot of argument, consideration of cases, decisions and all manner of reasons in between. But none of that is relevant to your job in this trial ultimately, which is on the basis of the evidence to decide whether or not the Crown has proved beyond doubt or on any of the charges that they bring against one or other of [the appellants]. 
         
         
        So there’s no need for, no room for, and I direct you you must not speculate about what might have been the reasons for the delay. Of course I apologise to you for the delay but it is no one’s fault, we’ve not been sitting on our hands going off for a picnic or something like that over the last few days. Time has been well spent and we’re now in a position to kick on with the trial tomorrow.”  
        
       
       
      Her Honour indicated that she expected the hearing to commence at 10 am or shortly thereafter.  
       
      
    131 At the commencement of the hearing on 23 February, Dr Glennon, Samadi’s counsel, again appeared and informed her Honour that he understood his instructions had been reinstated and that he wished to confirm that with Samadi. Her Honour granted an adjournment until 11.30 am. 
     
      
    132 At about 11.50-55 am, the trial recommenced and her Honour gave the jury a direction in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Ladies and gentlemen … we’re back to the evidence and the trial all things being equal will continue to the end. I understand or I anticipate as I said yesterday it’s well within the estimate I already gave eight to ten weeks … I just wanted to bring your attention to one thing and that is that Dr Glennon’s back at the bar table appearing for [Samadi] and I told you I think Monday the 20th that he was not at that stage appearing for him. That’s now no longer the case, he’s back and the reasons for that as I said to you then and again yesterday that is not a relevant matter in this trial at all and not a matter for your speculation and I direct you that you must not speculate about what those reasons might be because they are simply not relevant to this trial.  
        
       
      
    133 There is no dispute as to the principles which apply in determining whether there has been an error by the trial judge in refusing to discharge a jury. The underlying principle is that an accused must receive a fair trial in accordance with law. In Crofts v R [1996] HCA 22; (1996) 186 CLR 427 the principle was stated in the plurality judgment (Toohey, Gaudron, Gummow and Kirby JJ) at 440-441, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “No rigid rule can be adopted to govern decisions on an application to discharge a jury for an inadvertent and potentially prejudicial event that occurs during a trial. The possibilities of slips occurring are inescapable. Much depends upon the seriousness of the occurrence in the context of the contested issues; the stage at which the mishap occurs; the deliberateness of the conduct; and the likely effectiveness of a judicial direction designed to overcome its apprehended impact. As the court below acknowledged, much leeway must be allowed to the trial judge to evaluate these and other considerations relevant to the fairness of the trial, bearing in mind that the judge will usually have a better appreciation of the significance of the event complained of, seen in context, than can be discerned from reading transcript.  
         
         
        Nevertheless, the duty of the appellate court, where the exercise of discretion to refuse a discharge is challenged, is not confined to examining the reasons given for the order to make sure that the correct principles were kept in mind. The appellate court must also decide for itself whether, in these circumstances, the result of the refusal to discharge the jury occasioned the risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice. In other words, can the appellate court say with assurance that, but for the admission of the inadmissible evidence, the conviction was inevitable?:

        The Queen 
         (1978) 52 ALJR 631 at 635; 20 ALR 513 at 521.” 
        
       
      
    134 The importance of the underlying principle of fairness and the question whether any prejudicial effect may be overcome by an appropriate direction are continually emphasised in the authorities: see R v Sheikh [2004] NSWCCA 38; [2004] 144 A Crim R 124 at [19] and [39]-[40] per Mason P and Wood CJ at CL. In that case, Sully J noted that a challenge that a trial judge’s refusal to discharge a jury was in fact a challenge to conviction and in that circumstance, the court’s powers to intervene were prescribed by s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        6 Determination of appeals in ordinary cases 
         
         
        (1) The court on any appeal under section 5 (1) against conviction shall allow the appeal if it is of opinion that the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable, or cannot be supported, having regard to the evidence, or that the judgment of the court of trial should be set aside on the ground of the wrong decision of any question of law, or that on any other ground whatsoever there was a miscarriage of justice, and in any other case shall dismiss the appeal; provided that the court may, notwithstanding that it is of opinion that the point or points raised by the appeal might be decided in favour of the appellant, dismiss the appeal if it considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred.” 
        
       
      
    135 His Honour, at [118], observed that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a contention that the appellant’s convictions manifest a miscarriage of justice propounds in essence that the refusal of the discharge applications caused the subsequent trial of the appellant to miscarry by entailing ‘that he may thereby have lost a chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted’:  
        Mraz v The Queen  
        (1955) 93 CLR 493 at 514 per Fullagar J.”  
        
       
       
      The onus of proving that proposition rests upon the appellant: see  
      Driscoll v R 
       [1977] HCA 43; (1977) 137 CLR 517 at 526 per Barwick CJ.  
       
      
    136 In R v Bartle [2003] NSWCCA 329; (2003) 181 FLR 1 Mason P and Barr J, when dealing with a direction given by a trial judge to the jury to ignore certain evidence, commented, at [82], that it is the experience of courts “that reliance upon the integrity and sense of duty of jurors is not misplaced”: see R v Glennon [1992] HCA 16; (1992) 173 CLR 592 at 614-615 per Dawson J. Their Honours considered that it was correct for the trial judge to believe a jury was likely to follow an instruction to ignore the evidence that had been struck out. 
     
      
    137 I am not satisfied there was any miscarriage of justice in this case in the trial judge refusing to discharge the jury. Although counsel for Djait originally sought to place emphasis upon the fact that what she categorised as the “weaker counts” was given prior to the adjournment and evidence on the other counts was given when the trial resumed, this understanding of the course of the trial was not accurate. The complaint came down merely to the length of time in which the jury was not hearing evidence. 
     
      
    138 The trial in this matter occupied 30 days. Although some difficult legal issues arose, particularly regarding the manner in which the evidence on different counts could be used in relation to other counts, the evidence in respect of each individual incident was quite simple and the facts were within a short compass. In my opinion, it would not have been difficult for the jury to keep in mind the different witnesses in each complaint and the different circumstances relating to each complaint. Her Honour gave clear directions to the jury immediately upon the resumption of the hearing. In addition, the addresses to the jury were detailed, as was her Honour’s summing up. In my opinion, Djait has not demonstrated that there was a risk of a substantial miscarriage of justice by her Honour’s refusal to discharge the jury.  
     
      
       
      Application to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    139 The sentences imposed upon Samadi were as follows: 
     
      
       
      (i)  
      Upon counts 1, 2 and 3: 
       a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 20 October 2004 and expiring 19 October 2009, with a balance of term of 3 years expiring on 19 October 2012; 
       
       
      (ii)  
      Upon count 4: 
       a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 20 October 2005 and expiring 19 October 2010, with a balance of term of 3 years expiring 19 October 2013; 
       
       
      (iii)  
      Upon counts 5 and 6: 
       a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 20 October 2006 and expiring 19 October 2011, with a balance of term of 3 years expiring 19 October 2014; 
       
       
      (iv)  
      Upon counts 7 and 8: 
       a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 20 October 2007 and expiring 19 October 2012, with a balance of term of 3 years expiring 19 October 2015; 
       
       
      (v)  
      Upon counts 9, 10 and 11: 
       a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 20 October 2008 and expiring 19 October 2013, with a balance of term of 3 years expiring 19 October 2016; 
       
       
      (vi)  
      Upon count 15: 
       a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 20 October 2009 and expiring 19 October 2014, with a balance of term of 3 years expiring 19 October 2017; 
       
       
      (vii)  
      Upon count 16: 
       a non-parole period of 6 years commencing 20 October 2010 and expiring 19 October 2016 with a balance of term of 3 years expiring on 19 October 2019.  
       
      
    140 Her Honour thus imposed an overall effective sentence of 15 years and a non-parole period of 12 years. The sexual assault offence, count 16, carried a standard non-parole period of 7 years. Her Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “[This offence] seems to me must come to, if not above the middle range of offences objectively at the very least because [the appellants] in each case knew that the [victim was] under the influence of drugs which [the appellants] themselves had in fact administered and would be unable to resist the sexual intercourse.” (ROS 37) 
        
       
      
    141 Samadi makes three complaints in respect of these sentences. First, it was submitted that there was an element of double punishment in the fact that the administration of the drug was the very basis of the lack of consent in the sexual offence matter, but that this feature, that is, the administration of the drug, had otherwise been dealt with upon sentence with respect to the s 38 offences. Secondly, it was submitted the sentence imposed for the sexual assault offence was otherwise excessive. Thirdly, it was submitted that the non-parole periods of 5 years in respect of the s 38 offences were also excessive. It was submitted that this was particularly so, given that the total period of criminality was over a period of less than one week, no victim sustained any lasting physical injury, Samadi had no prior criminal history and this involved his first sentence of imprisonment which he was serving upon protection. Finally, it was submitted that the overall non-parole period was excessive in the circumstances. This ground was directed to her Honour’s finding that even though she found it difficult to assess the appellants’ prospects of rehabilitation, she considered they might be assisted by somewhat longer than normal period of supervision after their release.  
     
      
    142 Samadi complains that given the periods of partial accumulation, the overall proportion of the non-parole period to the head sentence was 80 per cent, which was in fact higher than the usual proportion of 75 per cent.  
     
      
    143 The same sentences were imposed on Djait, with this difference. Djait was convicted of three sexual assault offences, being counts 12, 13 and 14. Her Honour imposed concurrent sentences of 6 years, with a non-parole period of 3 years. In addition, the first sentence was commenced from 19 October 2004, being the date that he was taken into custody. 
     
      
    144 The concurrent sentences imposed on Djait for the sexual assault offences has given rise to a further ground of appeal in the case of Samadi, in that he says he has a justifiable sense of grievance that he was subject to the same effective sentence, given that he was convicted of one count of sexual assault, whereas Djait was convicted of three. 
     
      
    145 Except for this last matter, Djait raises the same arguments.  
     
      
    146 Neither of the appellants challenge her Honour’s findings that the s 38 offences were serious offences that the appellants had planned and carried them out in a systematic and coordinated way. They had obtained the drug legally upon prescription and each had had their individual prescriptions for 200 tablets filled during the time the offences were committed, one just before the first of the offences and the other just before the last. They carried the drugs on them in Tic Tac containers, which, her Honour considered, was done so that they would not arouse suspicion and enable them to administer the drugs easily to the victims. Her Honour also accepted the complainants were targeted, in the sense that they were likely to be tourists; that the drug was used so it was less likely the appellants would be detected because the complainants would suffer memory loss; and that the complainants were out enjoying themselves, making it less likely they would realise they had been robbed, after having their drinks spiked, rather than the possibility of simply losing or having their property stolen in crowded hotels or nightclubs. Her Honour considered that it was also relevant that the complainants who gave the appearance of tourists might have been expected to be less likely to report the offences and that the appellants knew that the impact of the drug would seriously hinder their ability to remember accurate details of the evening. Her Honour also referred to the risk of long-term physical harm from the drug. The evidence in the trial was that there was a possibility that any of the complainants could have suffered fatal consequences from ingesting the drug, although the risk was somewhat remote.  
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances of Samadi 
       
      
    147 Samadi was of Algerian origin and had come to Australia as a refugee in 2001. He was almost 29 as at the date of sentence and therefore approximately 27 as at the time of the offences. He appears that he has had two traumatic events in his life. One was when his grandmother died when he was a child. After her death, he appeared to have visual hallucinations, for which he had some unspecified treatment. Also, he had come to Australia via a refugee camp, where he had experienced and observed traumas, which her Honour accepted had adversely affected him to an extent.  
     
      
    148 Samadi has family support in the community.  
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances of Djait 
       
      
    149 Djait was older, being aged 36 as at the time of sentence and approximately 34 as at the date of the offences. He too was from Algeria and came to Australia as a refugee in 1998. His family has remained in Algeria and he has had no contact with them since being arrested for these offences. He has a previous criminal history involving one conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm, in 2004. That matter was dealt with in the Local Court under the provisions of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act and was dismissed and he was discharged on condition he undergo psychiatric treatment. Her Honour did not take that conviction into account in determining the appropriate sentence to be imposed in this case. Her Honour treated, as a mitigating factor, that he was a person without prior relevant convictions. Her Honour noted there was also a history of psychiatric treatment, but she was not able to discern what psychiatric conditions he had or was suffering from. She accepted, however, that he was suffering from and being appropriately treated for depression at the time of the offences. There was no clear evidence of an ongoing psychotic illness. Her Honour found that whatever psychiatric or psychological condition Djait was suffering from, there was no evidence that it played any part in the commission of these offences. She considered, however, that his psychiatric condition to some extent mitigated what would otherwise be an appropriate sentence, but held that it would be of limited significance.  
     
      
    150 Samadi, even after conviction, denied committing the offences. Her Honour considered there was no remorse or contrition on his part to be taken into account as a matter of mitigation. 
     
      
    151 Djait had, apparently, expressed remorse to Dr Westmore, psychiatrist, and indicated some empathy for his victims. However, he did not give any evidence himself of this.  
     
      
    152 On the sentence hearing before her Honour, Djait submitted that he should be afforded some utilitarian discount, because he had not put his identity in issue, nor his presence with the victim of the sexual assault. Her Honour rejected this and noted that the complainants, for the most part, were required to come to Sydney either from overseas or from interstate to give evidence and each was subjected to lengthy cross-examination on behalf of both Djait and Samadi. Her Honour rejected, in the circumstances, that there was any utilitarian value in Djait’s admission of his presence and the fact of sexual intercourse because his defence was that this had been consensual. Her Honour considered that the admissions did not indicate a willingness by Djait to facilitate to administration of justice. Her Honour pointed out, however, that this was not an aggravating feature, but said that it would not be taken into account as a mitigating feature. 
     
      
    153 Her Honour also took into account the fact that each of the appellants was in protection in prison, on their own applications, and even though she had little evidence of the circumstances of their imprisonment, she accepted this would probably limit their access to prisoner programmes, although Djait had taken advantage of some programmes whilst in prison, up to that point in time. 
     
      
    154 I have already referred above to her Honour’s consideration of the seriousness of the sexual assault charges, having regard to the standard non-parole period.  
     
      
    155 Her Honour considered that there was a wide range of sentences available in respect of the drink spiking offences, and little by way of assistance from statistics or decided cases. In assessing the objective seriousness of the offences, her Honour considered that a s 38 offence involving an intention to steal was less serious than an offence of causing physical harm to a person or to sexually assault a person. Her Honour also considered that, for the most part, the property stolen was of small value. Nonetheless, her Honour stated that “rendering someone unconscious” is serious. Likewise, targeting vulnerable people, either because they were drunk, as in the case of SM, or because they were tourists who were unlikely to report the commission of such a crime, was serious. Her Honour added, “drink spiking is serious and potentially fatal”. It followed, in her Honour’s opinion, that a “strong message of general deterrence” should be sent to the community by the sentences to be imposed. 
     
      
    156 Her Honour also turned her attention to the question of parity, considering that parity should apply. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no real difference in terms of their involvement in any of the offences and the jury’s verdicts confirm that. Their subjective circumstances are very similar. It seems to me that there is no real difference between the two of them and I propose that the same sentence be applied to each.”  
        
       
      
    157 Her Honour did not, however, give any consideration to the question of the difference in the number of sexual assault offences committed by Djait, as compared to Samadi. Samadi complains that he has a justifiable sense of grievance in the circumstances, in being given the same overall sentence as Djait.  
     
      
    158 Her Honour emphasised that general deterrence was important in sentencing for these offences. I agree. Drink or food spiking is a particularly insidious form of criminal activity. As Grove J pointed out in R v Reyes [2005] NSWCCA 218 at [81], (Wood CJ at CL and Hoeben J agreeing): 
     
      
       
        
        “… a gauge to the seriousness with which Parliament has regarded offences of this type can be found in the prescription of a maximum term of twenty five years imprisonment. Except where life sentence is available this is the equivalent of the highest available determinate sentence to be found in the  
        Crimes Act. 
         For these offences it is of great importance to pay heed to general deterrence and significant weight should be given to it:  
        R v Bulut 
         [2004] NSWCCA 325.”  
        
       
      
    159 In Bulut, Hoeben J (Spigelman CJ and Barr J agreeing) referred to R v Harrison (1997) 93 A Crim R 314 at 320, where the Court referred to the primacy of general deterrence in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Except in well defined circumstances such as youth or the mental incapacity of the offender … public deterrence is generally regarded as the main purpose of punishment, and the subjective considerations relating to the particular prisoner (however persuasive) are necessarily subsidiary to the duty of the courts to see that the sentence which is imposed will operate as a powerful factor in preventing the commission of similar crimes by those who may otherwise be tempted by the prospect that only light punishment will be imposed.” 
        
       
      
    160 In my opinion, the sentencing purpose of general deterrence given the nature of this offence, including its insidiousness and the potential serious effects of the administration of this drug on unwitting recipients, underscores the seriousness with which the s 38 offences should be approached. Those who might think that drink or food spiking is a soft crime should be under no misapprehension that it is not so viewed by the legislature or by the Courts. Those who are convicted of such offence should expect to be dealt with by the courts on the basis that it is a very serious crime. 
     
      
    161 Her Honour carefully examined the subjective circumstances of each appellant and I agree with her findings on those matters.  
     
      
    162 I also agree with her Honour’s finding of special circumstances, which was well founded. I would add that, in accordance with well-accepted sentencing authority, the accumulation of the sentences provides another reason for finding special circumstances.  
     
      
    163 Her Honour was faced with a difficult sentencing task. Unfortunately, however, the overall effective sentence imposed by her Honour did not reflect her finding of special circumstances. Section 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that the balance of term of the sentence to be imposed, after the non-parole period has been stated, must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence unless the Court finds special circumstances, in which case it is required to state the reasons for the finding of special circumstances. This section permits, but does not require, the Court to vary the specified ratio. However, the very purpose of finding special circumstances is to provide the basis upon which the court may, and as a matter of sentencing practice will, vary the specified ratio favourably to the accused, to allow, inter alia, for a longer period of parole, so as to assist the convicted person to reintegrate into society.  
     
      
    164 Her Honour gave reasons for finding special circumstances. However, the effect of the overall sentence imposed was that the ratio between the non-parole period and the overall effective sentence was 80 per cent and thus provided a shorter period on parole than is contemplated even by the statutory ratio. Had she applied the ratio referred to in s 44(2), the non-parole period would have been 11 years 3 months. It is likely that after such a difficult sentencing exercise her Honour did not appreciate the effect of her overall sentence was to impose a non-parole period in excess of the ratio of 75 per cent that is derived from s 44(2): see my comments in Hogan v Regina [2008] NSWCCA 150.  
     
      
    165 In my opinion, the appellants are entitled to be sentenced so that the finding of special circumstances is appropriately reflected in the overall sentence imposed, so that some other sentence is warranted in law: s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act.  
     
      
    166 That leaves only the question of parity as between the sexual assault offences. The principles in this are well-known and do not need to be restated in this appeal: see Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606; Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295.  
     
      
    167 In my opinion, Samadi would have a justifiable sense of grievance in that he was charged with one offence, rather than three offences, as was Djait. There has to be balanced against this, however, the fact that Djait’s offending was all part of one incident, so that it was appropriate for her Honour to make those sentences concurrent. I would propose to deal with this aspect of the case by reducing both the non-parole period and the balance of term as compared to Djait. 
     
      
    168 In the case of Samadi, therefore, I have reached the conclusion that there was error in the trial judge’s sentencing approach, both in failing to impose a sentence that gave effect to the finding of special circumstances, and in failing to have regard to the greater number of offences in respect of which Djait was convicted. In the case of Djait, I am of the same opinion in relation to the failure to give effect to the finding of special circumstances. There should, therefore, be a slight adjustment of the sentences imposed by her Honour.  
     
      
    169 The re-sentencing process has presented its own difficulties. In the end, the allowance for special circumstances, which is logically made on the last sentences imposed by her Honour, has resulted in a lesser sentence on the sexual assault counts that she imposed. That is not to suggest that this Court has taken a lesser view of the seriousness of those offences. To the contrary. The variation of those sentences is only so as to give proper effect to the finding of special circumstances and additionally in the case of Samadi to reflect my conclusion on parity.  
     
      
    170 Finally, I would add that I propose that otherwise there be fixed terms imposed for the s 38 offences as any non-parole period would have been absorbed in the later sentences.  
     
      
    171 The orders that I propose are as follows: 
     
      
       
      CCA 06/4963: Samadi: 
       
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed; 
       
       
      2. Application for leave to appeal against sentence allowed and appeal against sentence allowed; 
       
       
      3. Quash the sentences imposed by the trial judge and re-sentence the appellant Samadi as follows:  
       
       
      (i)  
      Upon counts 1, 2 and 3: 
       a fixed term of 5 years commencing 20 October 2004 and expiring 19 October 2009.  
       
      
     (ii) Upon count 4: a fixed term of 5 years commencing 20 October 2005 and expiring 19 October 2010 
     
      
     (iii) Upon counts 5 and 6: a fixed term of 5 years commencing 20 October 2006 and expiring 19 October 2011. 
     
      
     (iv) Upon counts 7 and 8: a fixed term of 5 years commencing 20 October 2007 and expiring 19 October 2012 
     
      
     (v) Upon counts 9, 10 and 11: a fixed term of 5 years commencing 20 October 2008 and expiring 19 October 2013.  
     
      
       
      (vi)  
      Upon count 15: 
       a fixed term of 5 years commencing 20 October 2009 and expiring 19 October 2014.  
       
       
      (vii)  
      Upon count 16: 
       a non-parole period of 4 years 7 months commencing 20 October 2010 and expiring 19 May 2015 with a balance of term of 3 years 11 months expiring on 19 April 2019.  
       
       
      The overall effective sentence imposed upon the appellant Samadi therefore is 14 years and 6 months comprising a non-parole period of 10 years 7 months with a balance of term of 3 years 11 months. The earliest date upon which the appellant Samadi is eligible to be released is 19 May 2015.  
       
       
      CCA 06/4986: Djait 
       
       
      1. Appeal against conviction dismissed; 
       
       
      2. Application for leave to appeal against sentence allowed and appeal against sentence allowed; 
       
       
      3. Quash the sentences imposed by the trial judge and re-sentence the appellant Djait as follows: 
       
       
      (i)  
      Upon counts 1, 2 and 3: 
       a fixed term of 5 years commencing 20 October 2004 and expiring 19 October 2009.  
       
      
     (ii) Upon count 4: a fixed term of 5 years commencing 20 October 2005 and expiring 19 October 2010.  
     
      
       
      (iii)  
      Upon counts 5 and 6: 
       a fixed term of 5 years commencing 20 October 2006 and expiring 19 October 2011.  
       
       
      (iv)  
      Upon counts 7 and 8: 
       a fixed term of 5 years commencing 20 October 2007 and expiring 19 October 2012.  
       
       
      (v)  
      Upon counts 9, 10 and 11: 
       a fixed term of 5 years commencing 20 October 2008 and expiring 19 October 2013. 
       
       
      (vi)  
      Upon count 15: 
       a fixed term of 5 years commencing 20 October 2009 and expiring 19 October 2014.  
       
       
      (vii)  
      Upon counts 12: 13: and 14:  
      a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 19 October 2010 and expiring 18 October 2015 with a balance of term of 4 years expiring on 18 October 2019.  
       
       
      The overall effective sentence imposed upon the appellant Djait therefore is 15 years comprising a non-parole period of 11 years with a balance of term of 4 years. The earliest date upon which the appellant Djait is eligible to be released is 18 October 2015.  
       
      
    172 HISLOP J: I agree with Beazley JA. 
     
      
    173 PRICE J: I agree with Beazley JA’s reasons for allowing the sentence appeals and the orders proposed by her Honour.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BELL JA: On 27 March 2007 the appellant was convicted in the District Court following a trial before Bennett DCJ and a jury on an indictment that charged him with communicating the contents of a document which had come into his possession when he was a Commonwealth officer and which it was his duty not to disclose. The offence is provided in s 70(2) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for two years. On 22 June 2007 his Honour entered a conviction upon the jury’s verdict and sentenced the appellant to imprisonment for nine months, to be released forthwith on a recognizance under s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act that he be of good behaviour for nine months.  
     
      
    2 The appellant appeals against his conviction.  
     
      
    3 The offence was particularised as that between 10 and 31 May 2005 the appellant having been an officer of the Australian Customs Service (the ACS) communicated to Martin Chulov and Jonathan Porter the contents of documents, the “Threat Assessment of Airport Security Screening Personnel Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport” (the Threat Assessment report) and “Sydney Airport – Air Border Security – Risk Analysis 2003” (also known as “Tarmac Report 2003”) (the Risk Analysis Report), which had come into his possession as a Commonwealth officer.  
     
      
    4 The appellant had been a member of an intelligence unit with the ACS, which was located at the Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport, the Air Border Security Team (the ABS Team). The Threat Assessment report contained a security assessment of an organisation that had been contracted to provide security services at the airport. The Risk Analysis report replicated the text and contents of the Threat Assessment report in the section dealing with the security organisation and contained security assessments of a wide range of persons working at the airport. Both reports were written by Caterina Magni, the leader of the ABS Team. The ABS Team office was located in a secure area within the airport and Ms Magni and the other six members of the ABS Team including the appellant worked in it. Ms Magni provided electronic copies of parts of the report to other team members for their comment. The appellant received copies of parts of the two reports by email. Hardcopies of both reports were kept in a locked security cabinet in the ABS Team room and members of the ABS Team had access to them.  
     
      
    5 On 10 May 2005 the appellant resigned from the ACS. 
     
      
    6 On 31 May 2005 two articles were published in The Australian newspaper under the by-line “Martin Chulov” and “Jonathan Porter”. Each article included material paraphrasing the reports and, in some instances, direct quotations from the reports. Since the Risk Analysis report reproduced the Threat Assessment report the quotations and other material may have been drawn from the Risk Analysis report alone.  
     
      
    7 The ACS and the Australian Federal Police (the AFP) conducted an investigation to determine the source of the “leaked” report/s. All of the persons who had had access to the reports were interviewed in the course of the investigation.  
     
      
    8 On 6 September 2006 the AFP executed search warrants at the appellant’s home and at his mother’s home at which he stayed from time to time. A copy of the Threat Assessment report was found at his home together with a piece of paper with the name Martin Chulov and a telephone number written on it. A copy of the Risk Analysis report was found at his mother’s home together with a business card on which was printed the name Martin Chulov and contact details.  
     
      
    9 Telephone call charge records established that in May 2005 a number of calls had been made from the landline at the appellant’s home to telephone numbers subscribed to by News Ltd (the proprietor of The Australian). These included calls to the number allocated to Martin Chulov in the offices of The Australian and to a mobile telephone number allocated to Martin Chulov. At around the same time, telephone calls had been made to telephone numbers subscribed to by News Ltd from the landline at the appellant's mother’s home and from a public telephone located about 70m from her home. 
     
      
    10 On 10 May 2005 the appellant signed documents including an “Official Secrets” form in which he acknowledged his understanding that all official information that he had acquired in the course of his duties for the Commonwealth was not to be published or communicated to any unauthorised person after his service with the Commonwealth. He certified that all information acquired by him in the course of his employment with the Commonwealth had been returned to an appropriate Commonwealth representative.  
     
      
    11 The appellant did not give or call any evidence at the trial.  
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
       
        
        1. The verdict in all the circumstances was unreasonable or could not be supported by the evidence.  
        
       
       
        
        2. The trial judge erred in directing the jury that it was sufficient if they were satisfied that the appellant had communicated to either of the journalists named in the Indictment, namely Martin Chulov or Jonathan Porter. 
        
       
       
        
        3. The trial judge erred in permitting into evidence exhibit F (copy of the Australian newspaper dated 31/5/2005), this being a hearsay document.  
        
       
       
        
        4. The trial judge erred in refusing defence counsel request to give a warning under sec. 165 of the  
        Evidence Act 
         in respect of exhibit F. 
        
       
       
        
        5. The trial judge erred in not giving a  
        Jones v. Dunkel 
         direction when sought by defence counsel. 
        
       
       
        
        6. The trial judge mis-directed the jury when answering questions posed in MFI 46. 
        
       
       
        
        7. The trial judge erred in directing the jury the Crown was not obliged to prove all the contents of the Reports were communicated and that the communication could have been done “directly” or “indirectly”. 
        
       
       
        
        8. The trial judge erred in his re-directions to the jury concerning their questions posed in MFI 52. 
        
       
       
        
        9. The trial judge erred in permitting into evidence over objection exhibit M, the evidence of Donna Scattolin. 
        
       
       
        
        10. The trial judge erred in admitting into evidence exhibit E (series of e-mails from the appellant to various individuals at the Australian Customs service concerning his position whilst on leave and after having suffered an injury). 
        
       
      
    12 The first ground contends that the verdict cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. It is convenient to defer consideration of this ground.  
     
      
       
      The directions concerning the elements of the offence 
       
      
    13 The indictment charged the appellant in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        That Allan Robert Kessing having been a Commonwealth officer, namely an officer of the Australian Customs Service, did between about 10 May 2005 and 31 May 2005 communicated to Martin Chulov and Jonathan Porter, without lawful authority or excuse, contents of documents, namely two reports, “Threat Assessment of Airport Security Screening Personnel Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport” and “Sydney Airport – Air Border Security – Risk Analysis 2003” also known as “Tarmac Report 2003”, which came into his possession, by virtue of having been a Commonwealth officer, and which, at the time when he ceased to be a Commonwealth officer, it was his duty not to disclose. 
        
       
      
    14 The issue raised by ground 2 concerns whether it was incumbent on the Crown to prove that the appellant intentionally communicated the whole of the contents of the two reports to each of Martin Chulov and Jonathan Porter. Towards the end of the Crown case the jury asked whether it was necessary that the Crown prove communication to both journalists. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that it was sufficient that it establish communication to either Martin Chulov or Jonathan Porter. The trial judge accepted this submission and directed the jury accordingly. Dr Glennon submitted that the direction was wrong in law and that it involved a fundamental change in the way the Crown put its case, which was unfair. It is necessary to refer to the course of the trial in order to deal with the second aspect of this complaint. 15 The Crown Prosecutor said this in opening, (T’cpt 6/3/07 21.54-22.10): 
     
      
       
        
        So the next element, ladies and gentlemen, is, on the second line you’ll see, “did between about 10 May 2005 and 31 May 2005 communicated to Martin Chulov and Jonathan Porter without lawful authority or excuse contents of documents, namely two reports” and then the names of the reports are particularised. What is critical about this particular element, ladies and gentlemen, is that the accused, the Crown says, did communicate two documents, two reports. So the second element that the Crown must prove is the accused did communicate those reports. The Crown says those reports were communicated to two persons that are named there, Martin Chulov and Jonathan Porter, and by way of particularising or identifying the reports the Crown has set out what they are. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        So, just to recap, ladies and gentlemen, there are four crucial elements. … Second, the Crown must show that the accused did communicate the contents of the two reports known as “Threat Assessment” and “Risk Analysis” to the persons named in the indictment. (T’cpt 6/3/07 22.47-53) 
        
       
      
    16 The Crown Prosecutor went on to outline the evidence that he anticipated leading, which included the publication in The Australian of the two articles under the by-line “Martin Chulov Jonathan Porter”, the execution of the search warrants and finding of the documents with the name “Martin Chulov” and contact details and the call charge records that revealed contact between telephone services associated with the appellant and telephone services associated with a person named “Martin Chulov”.  
     
      
    17 Mr Lowe opened to the jury immediately after the opening address of the Crown Prosecutor, saying: (T’cpt 6/3/07 34.48-55): 
     
      
       
        
        Now, what is of course in dispute is that my client disputes that he communicated the contents of the document, that is, either of the two documents referred to by the Crown, to  
        Martin Chulov or Jonathan Porter 
        , who were journalists from  
        The Australian 
        . Someone else, perhaps, from Customs, but not necessarily so, must have leaked that report or communicated the contents of that report. (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
      
    18 Towards the end of the Crown case, the Crown Prosecutor applied to amend the indictment to delete the words, “the Threat Assessment of Airport Security Screening Personnel Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport. (T’cpt 20/3/07 720.11-28) He explained that he anticipated that defence counsel may invite the jury to acquit the appellant on the basis of the Crown’s inability to prove communication of both reports since the contents of the Threat Assessment report were reproduced in the Risk Analysis report. The trial judge indicated a preliminary view that there was no need for the amendment. (T’cpt 20/3/07 729.19-29) His Honour went on to ask the Crown whether it was sufficient if the jury were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the communication was either to Martin Chulov or to Jonathan Porter. The Crown’s position was that communication to either was sufficient. (T’cpt 20/3/07 730.48-52)  
     
      
    19 Mr Lowe submitted that the Crown had assumed the burden of proving communication to the two named persons. (T’cpt 20/3/07 732.44-49) His Honour observed that the appellant's case had been run on the basis that there had been no communication of the contents of the documents by the appellant. Mr Lowe acknowledged that this was so, conceding that “nothing has changed overnight”. (T’cpt 20/3/07 734.55) His Honour determined that communication to either person would be sufficient.20 In the course of the Crown Prosecutor’s closing address the jury asked a question (MFI 31) in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        Is proof (beyond a reasonable doubt) needed that the defendant communicated the contents of the documents to both Martin Chulov and Jonathan Porter? 
        
       
      
    21 The trial judge stated that he proposed responding to the question saying, “the Crown will have succeeded if it has persuaded you beyond reasonable doubt that the contents of the documents were communicated directly or indirectly to one of or both of these two reporters”. (T’cpt 21/3/07 22.24-28) Mr Lowe maintained the submission that he had earlier made that it was incumbent on the Crown to prove communication to both. 
     
      
    22 The Judge directed the jury in answer to their question (T’cpt 21/3/07 25.13-19): 
     
      
       
        
        This is something that I will need to direct you upon in the course of my summing-up to you, but in response to your specific question I can say this. The Crown will have succeeded in respect of the second element to the charge if it does satisfy you beyond reasonable doubt that the contents of the documents were communicated to either or both of Mr Chulov and Jonathan Porter. 
        
       
      
    23 Mr Lowe put the appellant's case in this way in his closing address (T’cpt 22/3/07 26.41-27.19): 
     
      
       
        
        So if there are other reasonable or rational hypotheses consistent with innocence, if you sit down in your deliberations and you think that there are rational or reasonable inferences such as there might have been a discussion by my client with somebody from “The Australian”, not about the contents of the report, or that somebody else might have had access to the report and provided it “The Australian” (sic) because of issues associated with Schapelle Corby or God knows what, for whatever reason, then you would be bound to find my client not guilty because there are other - the Crown hasn’t proved its case beyond reasonable doubt. In a circumstantial case the only inference that you would have to draw is one of guilt if you excluded all those other competing hypotheses consistent with innocence.  
        Now the real issue in this case is in fact whether my client is the person who communicated the contents of the report. 
         Now if you are of the view that there was a document that was in the possession of “The Australian” such as a hardcopy report, a copy of that report, the police could have executed a search warrant, they could have, they didn’t. They could have made a comparison between the two documents. For instance exhibits A, there’s evidence in this case exhibit A had handwritten notations on it. I’m not just saying one page but a number of pages. There are also in relation to exhibit B nicks in pages, creases, dog tagging particular pages and the like and even I think there’s a mark that was identified on the front cover of exhibit B. Well we know what was seized from my client’s house both at Marrickville and at Mount Victoria. Surely the best evidence in this case would have been to execute – if there was, if “The Australian” did have those reports, execute a search warrant, obtain a copy, make a comparison between what they had and what my client had, wouldn’t that be the best evidence you might well think. (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
      
    24 The elements of the offence which the Crown was required to prove beyond reasonable doubt were:  
     
      
       
        
        (a) the appellant having been a former Commonwealth officer; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) intentionally communicated a document/s;  
        
       
       
        
        (c) which document/s had come into his possession as a Commonwealth officer; and  
        
       
       
        
        (d) the appellant was under a duty not to disclose the documents. 
        
       
       
      The fault element for (a), (c) and (d) being recklessness. 
       
      
    25 The indictment pleaded the offence in the words of the statute and contained particulars of the offence which included that the documents had been communicated to Martin Chulov and Jonathan Porter. The failure to establish a particular does not mean that a conviction based on the indictment is bad in law: R v VHP (Court of Criminal Appeal, 7 July 1997, unreported BC9702876 at 15); R v Dossi (1918) 13 Cr App R 158 at 159-160. The requirements of procedural or substantive fairness will on occasions require that the Crown not be permitted to depart from the particulars: VHP.  This was the case in VHP: the date on which the offence was alleged to have been committed had become essential, due to the way the trial was conducted. 26 The first directions that the jury were given on this aspect of the proof of the Crown case were those given in answer to the jury’s question. They were directions given before the commencement of closing addresses. There was in reality no change in the Crown’s position. It was at all times the Crown case that the articles published in The Australian contained material drawn from the reports and that it was the appellant who had intentionally communicated that material. The Crown sought to prove its case by proving circumstances which included that copies of the reports and Martin Chulov’s contact details were found at that appellant’s and his mother’s home, call charge records showing contact between telephone services connected with the appellant and services connected with Mr Chulov and that the articles were published under the by-line “Martin Chulov Jonathan Porter”. The Crown had not opened a case on communication to Jonathan Porter based on any circumstance other than that the name “Jonathan Porter” appeared in the by-line. 27 Following the asserted change in the Crown’s position Mr Lowe did not ask for the recall of any witness. There was no suggestion that he would have conducted the appellant’s case differently had Jonathan Porter’s name not been particularised in the indictment. Mr Lowe met the case in exactly the way he had outlined in his opening before any evidence had been led, which was to put in issue that the appellant had communicated the contents of the documents to either Martin Chulov or Jonathan Porter.  
     
      
    28 The direction that the Crown would establish the second element of its case if it proved communication to either of the journalists was not wrong in law. There was no unfairness in the circumstances of this trial in permitting the Crown to depart from the particulars pleaded in the indictment in this respect.29 I turn now to the contention that it was necessary for the Crown to prove that the appellant communicated by direct means the whole of the contents of the two reports.  
     
      
    30 The trial judge directed the jury in the course of his summing up (T'cpt 22/3/07 18-19): 
     
      
       
        
        I ask you to note the emphasis that I just placed upon the words “contents of”. The wording of the charge regarding the matter of which you must be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt in this element is that the accused communicated the contents of the two documents there named. It may be the case that you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the reports were communicated in their entirety, that is to say by the provision of copies of those documents. If you were so satisfied, it would mean that the Crown has succeeded in respect of this particular aspect of the case it presents. However, the Crown does not allege that this is what the accused has done. The Crown alleges that he communicated contents of the two documents, whether or not actual copies of the document were provided. The question you must decide is whether or not you are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused communicated contents of the documents. In this regard you will note that the second document in time, that is the second report of which exhibit B is a redacted copy, incorporated in its text the content of the first report of which exhibit A is a redacted copy. Thus, the Crown would succeed upon this aspect of the case it presents if you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused communicated the content of the reports, whether he did so by communicating the content of one or both of the documents.  
        
       
      
    31 The indictment charges the appellant with the communication of the contents of the documents. The words of the section refer to, “a person who … publishes or communicates … any fact or document which came to his or her knowledge or into his or her possession … .” Where two or more subjects are qualified by two or more matters the qualifications may attach to the subjects in the order in which they appear: see, generally, DC Pearce and RS Geddes Statutory Interpretation in Australia (Aust: Butterworths, 2006, 6th ed) at 146, [4.34]. If the provision were framed in terms that, “a person who … communicates or publishes … a fact or document which came to his or her knowledge or possession” it may have been open to construe it as creating two ways in which the offence could be committed: (i) communicating a fact in the person’s knowledge or (ii) publishing a document in the person’s possession. The order of the words “publishes or communicates” does not suggest such a construction. There is no reason to conclude that one cannot “communicate” a document. This seems to have been accepted by Calloway JA in R v Kelly [2006] VSCA 221 at [8]. To “communicate” is to transmit or to impart knowledge or make known (Macquarie Concise Dictionary, 3rd ed.) One may “communicate” a document by communicating the contents of the document. This is how the Crown particularised this case. Generally, to publish connotes to make publicly known, however, in the law of defamation publication applies to making the matter complained of known to any person other than the person defamed. This appeal does not raise the distinction between publishing and communicating for the purposes of the offence created by s 70. 32 Dr Glennon’s submission was that communicating the “contents” of the document is to be understood as requiring the communication of the whole of the document. He cited Webster’s New Twentieth Century Dictionary, (unabridged, 2nd edition), in which “content” is defined to include: 
     
      
       
        
        1.  
        Usually 
        , all that is contained in something; everything inside; as the contents of a jar, trunk etc; (b) all that is contained or expressed in a writing or speech; as a table of contents is a list of chapters. (WS 1080) 
        
       
       
      In addition to the above meaning,  
      Webster’s New International Dictionary 
       (Springfield, Mass: G&C Merriam Co, 1959) defines “content” to include: 
       
       
        
        3. The sum and substance; the gist, as of a document or discourse; - formerly sometimes in pl., or in pl. construed as a  
        sing 
        . Essential meaning or significance.  
        
       
       
      The  
      Macquarie Dictionary 
      , (Australia: The Macquarie Library Pty Ltd, 2nd revision, 1987) definition includes: 
       
       
        
        1. (Usu.pl.) that which is contained: the contents of a cask, room, or book. 
         
        2. (Usu.pl.) the chapters or chief topics of a book or document; a list of such chapters or topics. 
         
        3. Substance or purport as of a document.  
        
       
      
    33 The purpose of the provision is to criminalise the unauthorised intentional disclosure of material that has come into a Commonwealth officer’s knowledge or possession by virtue of their office. The appellant’s construction of the provision would produce an absurd result in that a person might remove the coversheet from a confidential report and hand the balance of the report to a journalist with impunity since the whole of the report would not have been communicated. As a matter of ordinary English usage one communicates the contents of a document by conveying the substance or purport of the document or some part of it. Questions of degree may arise in determining whether the contents of a document have been communicated to another. In this case the articles in The Australian drew on material portions of the Risk Analysis report. It was not an error not to direct the jury that the Crown was not obliged to prove all the contents of each report had been communicated. 
     
      
    34 Dr Glennon’s next challenge was to the direction that it was sufficient that the communication of the contents of the document be by indirect means. The Crown submitted that indirect means were sufficient: Kelly per Callaway JA at [11] and Redlich JA and Coldrey AJA at [23]. The point was not raised in Kelly although it does appear that it was assumed that the communication of a document may be by indirect means. In Kelly the Crown case was that the document had been physically handed over to the journalist. Here the Crown did not confine its case in this respect. It was the Crown case that the articles demonstrated that the author/s had been informed of the contents of the reports (or at least the contents of the Risk Analysis report).  
     
      
    35 The Crown Prosecutor in his closing submissions put it this way (T'cpt 25.54-26.14): 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown doesn’t need to prove to you that the documents themselves were handed over to any particular person. The Crown doesn’t have to prove to you that there was communication by some particular means, either verbally or given a copy to a particular person. The Crown doesn’t need to prove to you that the communication was directly to either of those journalists. It could have been indirect. For example, a copy might have been sent in to a journalist. A copy might have been left at a location. There could have been communication over the telephone by speaking to one of the persons and reading out some parts of the reports. The Crown doesn’t need to prove that. All you need to be satisfied of is that the Crown has proven beyond reasonable doubt that there was in fact communication. What the Crown says is that you can see that there has been because when you look at the newspaper articles and the reports, you can see that the contents of each of those appears in some parts within the newspaper article. 
        
       
      
    36 Dr Glennon’s submissions did not develop the distinction between direct and indirect communication. On one view, acceptance of his submission would mean that the offence would be committed by handing a copy of a document to another, but not by posting it to that other. Communication of the contents of a document requires no more than that the contents be conveyed or transmitted to another. This may be done directly by handing the document to another or by reading the document to another. It may be done indirectly by leaving the document on a park bench for another to collect or in any of a variety of ways. The essential feature of communicating a fact or document for the purposes of s 70 is that the communication is intentional. There was no error in the trial judge directing the jury that communication of the contents of the document may be by indirect means. Grounds 2 and 7 are without merit. 
     
      
      The hearsay challenge 
       
      
    37 At the trial Mr Lowe objected to the admission of a copy of The Australian dated 31 May 2005 (exhibit F) on the basis that it was “absolute hearsay”. (T'cpt 12/3/07 269.54) Dr Glennon submitted that the trial judge erred in admitting the document over objection. He supported this submission by reference to a number of authorities dealing with the hearsay rule at common law, including Myers v DPP [1965] AC 1001. In Myers the House of Lords declined to create new exceptions to the hearsay rule, observing that such a task must be left to the legislature. Following the decision the Criminal Evidence Act 1965 (UK) was enacted to overcome some of the restrictions of the operation of the rule.  
     
      
    38 The trial judge was correct to admit exhibit F. The newspaper was received in order to prove the words that appeared in the two articles. This was relevant to proof of the Crown case. The newspaper was not received to prove the existence of a fact that the author or authors of the two articles (or of any other of the material) intended to assert by the representation: Evidence Act 1995 (NSW), s 59.  
     
      
    39 The assertion in the written submissions filed on the appellant's behalf that the trial miscarried because the trial judge directed the jury to compare the copy of exhibit F with the copies of the redacted reports, exhibits A and B, is misconceived. A circumstance in the Crown case was that the article contained quotations from the reports and paraphrased parts of the reports (or at least the Risk Analysis report). The invitation to compare the two did not involve an invitation to use the articles for a hearsay purpose.  
     
      
    40 The Crown did seek to have the by-line “Martin Chulov Jonathan Porter” admitted for a hearsay use. The Crown Prosecutor submitted that the by-line was admissible under s 70 of the Evidence Act as evidence of the fact that Martin Chulov and Jonathan Porter were the authors of the articles. Mr Lowe objected to the reception of the by-line as evidence of the fact of authorship. His Honour did not give reasons for the admission of the newspaper, but he appears to have accepted the Crown Prosecutor’s submission with respect to the operation of s 70. (T'cpt 13/3/07 341.38-39)  
     
      
    41 Section 70 provides: 
     
      
       
        
        The hearsay rule does not apply to a tag or label attached to, or writing placed on, an object (including a document) if the tag or label or writing may reasonably be supposed to have been so attached or placed:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) in the course of a business, and  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) for the purpose of describing or stating the identity, nature, ownership, destination, origin or weight of the object, or of the contents (if any) of the object.  
          
         
        
       
      
    42 The Crown submitted that the inclusion of the names, “Martin Chulov” and “Jonathan Porter” under the headings of the newspaper articles was writing placed on the document that may reasonably be supposed to have been placed in the course of business for the purpose of describing or stating Mr Chulov’s and Mr Porter’s ownership of the articles in the sense of their authorship of them. I am not persuaded that is so. In my opinion, the text of an article printed in a newspaper or magazine is not writing placed on an object (including a document) within s 70. Moreover, without addressing consideration of such rights as employed journalists may have in their work published in a newspaper, magazine or periodical it is straining the language of s 70 to hold that the by-line has been placed on the document to state the ownership of the article. 43 Exhibit F was admitted in the course of the evidence of Federal Agent Read on 14 March 2007. (T'cpt 496.1) His Honour directed the jury at the time of its admission that (T'cpt 14/3/07 496.34-55): 
     
      
       
        
        Just while that’s being distributed ladies and gentlemen [copies of exhibit F] I want to say something to you about the document which is about to be read to you, and I’ll be going into some detail when I give my directions to you at the end of the evidence and after counsel have addressed. But the document, that is the article which you’re about to hear contains in it a number of representations. Some person has written the article and in that article there are assertions of facts. At this stage you should note that the document is being tendered to prove the fact that those matters were published, that is to say that the fact that the article was written in those terms. The truth of what is said within the article is a completely separate matter, and the document is not to be used at this stage as to the truth of what is said in the article. Simply it’s still a fact that the article was written. When I’m dealing with concepts of hearsay evidence it can be a little complex and difficult to understand. I can tell you a lot of lawyers don’t really understand this concept sometimes. But if you can just note that distinction at the moment and I’ll be dealing with it hopefully in a way that will make it all clear to you at the appropriate time.  
        
       
      
    44 Mr Lowe addressed the jury on the basis that exhibit F contained an assertion that the authors had obtained a copy of the reports. His Honour referred to this submission in the course of the summing up. He directed the jury that (SU 22/3/07 39-40): 
     
      
       
        
        Now I should say something to you about that submission by Mr Lowe because of the principles relevant to what lawyers refer to as hearsay evidence. By embracing the representations to which he invited your attention and which he asked you to accept as evidence of the fact that the report was with News Limited, he is inviting you to accept those particular representations as evidence of the existence of that fact, that is, that there was a hardcopy of the report with  
        The Australian 
         at the time. Now in exhibit F in the first article, those passages upon which he would rely are in the first column about half way down and I quote.“ According to a classified Customs report” and then in the second column of the first article in exhibit F, the first full paragraph and I quote, “The report obtained by  
        The Australian 
        ”. Now implicit in the submission that Mr Lowe has made to you is this proposition that he would have you accept that representation as evidence of the fact that it asserts. Well you may do so, but there a number of other representations in the document that you should not approach in the same way. Indeed, the balance of the article in its entirety and the balance of the other article, all of the other article rather, in exhibit F, you should simply view as evidence of the fact that those words were published in the newspaper on that day, for the purposes of comparing what was said and the passages quoted with what appears in exhibit A and B, so that you may draw, if you wish to do so, the inference that at the time those articles were prepared and written they had that text from those reports. That is the basis upon which the Crown tendered the articles and that is the way the Crown invites you to make use of the evidence. Mr Lowe has sought to make the greater use of those particular passages to which I have referred so that you might, in his submission, come to the view that the newspaper had a copy of the reports which would make redundant or unnecessary any need for the accused to communicate by telephone with the journalists or News Limited about the content of the reports.  
        
       
      
    45 Despite his Honour’s indication that he proposed to admit the by-line “Martin Chulov Jonathan Porter” under s 70 as evidence of the authorship of the article, he does not appear to have done so. Neither the direction given at the time the exhibit was tendered nor the direction in the summing up admitted of the by-line being used as evidence of the fact of authorship. The only assertion in exhibit F which his Honour left to the jury as capable of being used by them as evidence of the fact were the two assertions relied upon by Mr Lowe to establish that that author had a hardcopy of the reports.  
     
      
    46 His Honour summed up on the basis that the Crown case was circumstantial. One of the circumstances that his Honour pointed out the Crown relied upon was that the names of the journalists, Martin Chulov and Jonathan Porter, appeared in the by-line for the articles “allowing the inference the Crown says that they were the authors of those articles”. (SU 22/3/07, 27) The suggestion that the jury might infer from the by-line that the persons named in it were the authors of the article is an approach which has been applied in this State and in Victoria by judges hearing charges of contempt: R v Nationwide News Pty Ltd (Supreme Court of Victoria, 22 December 1997, unreported) Gillard J observed that:  
     
      
       
        
        [I]n the normal course of things, a person is not described as the author of an article in a well-known national newspaper without his permission. In my opinion I am entitled to infer from the photograph and name appearing in the rectangular box on p24 as being some evidence that he was responsible for the article. 
        
       
      
    47 In Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) v Sexton [2008] NSWSC 152 Howie J adopted a similar approach: 
     
      
       
        
        It seems to me that the overwhelming inference to be drawn from the appearance of the by-line in the context of the newspaper as a whole is that the person named in the by-line is the author of what follows and the person responsible for its contents. This is so whether or not some other person within the papers’ organisation also had responsibility for what was published, at least so far as the internal management of the newspaper is concerned.  
        
       
      
    48 The fact that the name Martin Chulov appeared in the by-line was a circumstance that was relevant to proof of the Crown’s case and did not depend upon proof of the asserted fact, that Martin Chulov was an author of the article. The article could have been written by a sub-editor. The significance, when taken with the other circumstances, was that the name “Martin Chulov” appeared in association with the articles.  
     
      
      MFI 46 
       
      
    49 Following their retirement the jury sent a note (MFI 46) asking:  
     
      
       
        
        Does confirmation that the reports are genuine constitute communication of the contents?  
        
       
       
        
        Does answering questions raised by Chulov in relation to the contents of the reports constitute communicating the contents of the reports? 
        
       
      
    50 During the course of the discussion concerning the directions that the trial judge might give in answer to the questions that the jury asked in MFI 46 there was the following exchange (T'cpt 22/3/07 54-55): 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: It may be that they are looking at what’s contained in the text of the articles to infer that there has been some representation by – or that there has been some investigative role played by Chulov to elicit the information that is recorded in the articles.  
        
       
       
        
        LOWE: It’s the no speculate rule that would apply. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I think I’m just going to re visit – the simple answer to those two questions, in my assessment, is “yes” but it should be accompanied by, I believe, a further or a reminder that they should not be using the article for a hearsay purpose beyond that which was advanced by Mr Lowe and that they should not embark upon speculation as to what might or might not have been said by witnesses who are not called. It just seems to me that if they are undertaking that exercise to which I’ve alluded, it may be they’re trying to look at the representation or a representation in that article or one of the articles or both and from that taking the view that it is evidence of the existence of that fact and then saying, “well, if that is the fact, is that an act of communication” which is contrary to what I’ve told them about the hearsay principles.  
        
       
       
        
        LOWE: It may be a section 165 direction is required, your Honour. It may be, because it’s hearsay evidence, 165(1)(a).  
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: But it’s not unreliable because they’re only looking at it as to the fact of the publication and they’re asked to compare – and I’ve told them that they should look to the quoted passages for comparison with the content of exhibit A and exhibit B, to see whether they can infer communication from those facts.  
        
       
       
        
        LOWE: Yes but it’s the pernicious effect about the third question that’s been posed.  
        
       
      
    51 Section 165(2) of the Evidence Act requires a trial judge in a case in which there is a jury to give a warning about evidence of a kind that may be unreliable if requested to do so by a party. Section 165(1) (a) – (g) lists the kinds of evidence that may be unreliable including hearsay evidence. Accepting for present purposes that the exchange above can be characterised as a request for a warning under s 165, it was a request for a warning that exhibit F may be unreliable because it was hearsay. A judge is not required to give a warning at the request of a party that evidence is of a kind that may be unreliable if there are good reasons for not doing so. The discussion which followed Mr Lowe’s statement that “it may be a section 165 direction is required” makes plain that the Judge did not give such direction because the jury had been directed not to use the newspaper article for a hearsay purpose. His Honour’s failure to give a direction that the copy of the newspaper article, exhibit F, may be unreliable because it was hearsay was not an error: the only hearsay use which his Honour directed the jury they might make of the contents of the article was the use that the appellant's counsel invited them to make.  
     
      
    52 Neither Martin Chulov nor Jonathan Porter gave evidence in the Crown case. Mr Lowe asked the trial judge to give a “full Jones v Dunkel” direction ([1959] HCA 8; (1959) 101 CLR 298). (T'cpt 21/3/07 74.39) 
     
      
    53 Federal Agent Read gave evidence of inquiries made by himself and by another officer concerning Mr Chulov and Mr Porter. Neither journalist had been willing to provide a statement or to assist the AFP in the investigation of the matter. Officer Read had been informed that Martin Chulov was overseas as at January 2006. He sent an email to Mr Chulov on 26 February 2007, to which he received a response from Mr Chulov on the same date advising that Mr Chulov’s position had not changed. The emails were in evidence, exhibit J. Mr Porter was in the jurisdiction. The Crown had served a subpoena on him to attend and give evidence at the trial. The Crown Prosecutor informed the Court that it was not his intention to call Mr Porter.  
     
      
    54 In Dyers v R [2002] HCA 45; (2002) 210 CLR 285 at 291 and 295 Gaudron and Hayne JJ observed: 
     
      
       
        
        Further, as a general rule, a trial judge should not direct the jury in a criminal trial that the prosecution would be expected to have called persons to give evidence other than those it did call as witnesses. It follows that, as a general rule, the judge should not direct the jury that they are entitled to infer that the evidence of those who were not called would not have assisted the prosecution. A direction not to speculate about what the person might have said should be given. Again, exceptions to these general rules will be rare and will arise only in cases where it is shown that the prosecution’s failure to call the person in question was in breach of the prosecution’s duty to call all material witnesses.  
        
       
      
    55 There was an explanation given for the circumstance that neither Mr Chulov nor Mr Porter were called at the trial in the Crown case.  
     
      
    56 Dr Glennon pointed to the reasons given by the Crown Prosecutor in the absence of the jury, for the decision not to call Mr Porter (T'cpt 8/3/07 151.49-54): 
     
      
       
        
        … the Crown’s position at the moment, as I indicated yesterday, the Crown does not wish to call Mr Porter, the Crown has had a subpoena issued and served so that he may be made available should the defence require him. We don’t know what he will say, he won’t assist, he won’t cooperate, he is an unknown quantity, your Honour.  
        
       
       
      In Dr Glennon’s submission, the Crown made a “nakedly tactical” decision not to call Mr Porter and called for a  
      Jones v Dunkel 
       direction.  
       
      
    57 This evidence was that neither journalist wished to cooperate with the authorities in the prosecution of the appellant. On the hearing of the appeal the Crown submitted that the prosecutor’s forensic decision not to call Mr Porter was reasonable. This was because it was highly probable that if called Mr Porter would decline to disclose his source. There was no reason to consider that Mr Porter’s evidence would tend to exculpate the appellant. As a matter of practical reality, calling Mr Porter was likely to be a distraction in that time would be taken up with consideration of the scope of the “protected confidence” privilege under s 126B of the Evidence Act and in the event that such a claim were unsuccessful with the prospect of Mr Porter nonetheless refusing to identify his source. The latter course, it was suggested, might occasion further delay arising out of consideration of contempt. In light of the results of the AFP’s inquiries and the ethical obligations of journalists with respect to the protection of the identity of sources, the Crown Prosecutor’s assumption that Mr Porter’s evidence was unlikely to advance either the Crown’s or the appellant’s case was reasonable. There is no basis to characterise the decision as a tactical one reflecting a view that Mr Porter’s evidence was unlikely to accord with the “Crown case theory”: cf R v Kneebone [1999] NSWCCA 279; 47 NSWLR 450. The trial did not miscarry as the result of the decision not to call Mr Porter in the Crown case. There was an explanation for the fact that the Crown did not call either journalist in its case. No occasion arose for the Judge to give a Jones v Dunkel direction.  
     
      
    58 The trial judge raised with counsel the response to be made to the jury’s two questions contained in MFI 46. (T'cpt 22/3/07 53-60) The questions are set out at [49] above. In the protracted discussion that followed, Mr Lowe’s submissions ranged from the suggestion of a s 165 warning to a renewed request for a Jones v Dunkel direction. They fastened on the concern that the jury may be engaging in impermissible speculation. It was not clear how Mr Lowe suggested that trial judge should answer the questions. The answer that the Judge gave is set out as follows: (T’cpt 22/3/07 62-63, 65): 
     
      
       
        
        In simple terms, one might answer both of those questions with “yes” but it is a little more complex than that and I need to go into some of the matters that I have already spoken about to you. “Confirmation that the reports are genuine” may involve a range of communications that in some instances may amount to a confirmation or rather amount to a communication of the contents, or it might not quite get across that threshold, depending upon what was said. The fact is there is no evidence of precisely what was done to communicate the contents of the report. The Crown has said to you that the evidence allows as the only rational inference that the accused communicated the contents of the report and communication of the contents of the report may have taken various forms, the precise nature of which is just not known. For example, the communication of the contents of the reports may have been by way of the document or documents in their hardcopy. The communication of the contents of the reports may have been by reading parts of the reports out to the person to whom the information is being communicated. The contents of the reports may have been communicated by way of an intermediary, or by an indirect route, to those to whom the Crown has said that the reports or the contents of the reports were communicated; from the accused to another person through a chain, as it were, with the purpose eventually to reach the journalists for the purposes of their publication. The Crown is not in a position, and indeed you are not in a position, to say one way or the other how that communication actually took place, but the Crown says that the evidence establishes that beyond reasonable doubt, and by way of the only rational inference, that the communication did take place, that is a communication by the accused to the journalists, directly or indirectly.  
        Now, it may also be communicated, that is the content of the reports may also be communicated in circumstances where the report or reports have been provided to the journalists and one or both of them have engaged the accused in conversation to discuss the contents of the reports, as you have asked, to confirm the accuracy or the bona fides or the veracity of some or all of the contents of the reports 
        . The Crown is not obliged to prove that all of the contents of the reports were communicated. Any part of the contents of the reports would satisfy that particular element of the charge, if they were communicated directly or indirectly by the accused to the journalists. 
        
       
       
        
        …  
        
       
       
        
        As I told you earlier, Mr Lowe said, there are two passages in that newspaper article that would lead you to the view that  
        The Australian 
         had copies of the reports, a hardcopy of the reports, and therefore the telephone calls, the contacts, the particulars of the phone numbers found in the possession of the accused are really neither here nor there because why would he need those if there’ve already got a copy of the report?  
        Well, if they do have a copy of the report and there is this telephone contact and there are communications between the accused and the journalists, to confirm or discuss the content of the report, that may be a communication of the content of the report for the purposes of this provision 
         and this charge and if that was something of which you were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as an inference, the only rational inference to draw from the evidence that is before you, that is a finding that you may come to.  
        
       
      
    59 After giving this direction the trial judge asked counsel if they wished him to revisit any aspect of it. Mr Lowe responded, “No I don’t think they’re shy from coming forward your Honour”. (T’cpt 22/3/07, 73) 
     
      
    60 The submissions filed by Dr Glennon contended that his Honour’s initial answer “yes” to the jury’s question was wrong. The submissions went on to assert that the great vice in the directions was “the potential for speculation and great confusion leading to a miscarriage of justice”. (WS [96]) 
     
      
    61 The jury’s questions raised whether it was sufficient for the Crown to establish that the appellant had confirmed the accuracy of material that the journalists had obtained from another source. His Honour directed the jury that it was. The direction was wrong. The offence under s 70 may be committed by publishing or communicating a fact which came to the knowledge of the accused by virtue of having been a Commonwealth officer or by publishing or communicating a document which came into his or her possession by virtue of having been a Commonwealth officer or by both. This was a case in which the offence charged was the communication of the documents. To confirm the accuracy of a document leaked by another to a journalist may be to communicate a fact, but in my opinion it is not to communicate the document. In any event, the Crown case was that the appellant was the person who was the source of the “leak”.  
     
      
    62 In written submissions the Crown acknowledged that the opening words of the direction at [58] above was wrong, but the Crown submitted the opening words were to be understood in the context of the whole which was said to have emphasised the need not to focus on what the nature of the communication might have been but rather on whether the Crown had established that it was the appellant who had communicated the contents of the reports.  
     
      
    63 The Crown’s submission is to be assessed against the highlighted parts of his Honour’s direction set out at par [58]. 
     
      
    64 Dr Glennon submitted that defence counsel had repeatedly “voiced objection to the many areas of speculation that his Honour touched upon” during the exchanges before the direction was given. (WS [102]) This submission has the same opacity as the submissions made at trial. At the commencement of the discussion the trial judge expressed the provisional view that confirming the genuineness of the reports would amount to communicating the contents of the documents. (T'cpt 22/3/07 53) At no point in the lengthy discussion that followed did Mr Lowe submit that to answer the jury’s question in this way was wrong in law and was not the case that the Crown had run. He did not request any re-direction after the answer was given. On the hearing of the appeal the Crown did not submit that leave should not be granted to allow the appellant to rely on ground 6 by reason of r 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules. As noted, the matter was argued on the appellant's behalf on the assumption that leave was not required because counsel, “made clear his objection to his Honour’s course of proposed directions, which touched upon the questions posed by MFI 46”. (WS [103]) This overstates the position. However, since the question of leave under r 4 was not agitated on the hearing it is not appropriate to refuse leave to permit the appellant to rely on a ground of appeal that has been made good. The trial judge’s directions given in answer to the two questions asked by the jury were wrong. The consequences of this error will be addressed after dealing with the remaining grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      The directions concerning MFI 1 and MFI 2 
       
      
    65 Exhibits A and B were redacted copies of the reports. Full copies of each report were MFI 1 and MFI 2 respectively. During the course of their retirement the jury sent a note (MFI 52): 
     
      
       
        
        We have found extracts in  
        The Australian 
         (31 May 05) articles that indicate they could only have come from the draft “ 
        Tarmac Report 
        ” (exhibit 2). We wish to be sure that these extracts do not exist in MFI 1 and/or MFI 2, example exhibit F, second column, second para – “it says baggage handlers, etc” and relates to exhibit 2 page 4. Also the reference to Operation Barina does not exist in MFI 1 or MFI 2. 
        
       
      
    66 Exhibit 2 comprised an email with an attachment being another redacted version of one of the reports.  
     
      
    67 The trial judge directed the jury that MFI 1 and MFI 2 were not exhibits and that they could not be given access to either of them. His Honour’s directions in this respect are not the subject of complaint. The Crown Prosecutor asked the Judge to give the jury a further direction to the effect that it was not necessary that they be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that everything in the articles came from the reports. His Honour gave the jury this further direction (SU 26/3/07 9): 
     
      
       
        
        It is not necessary for you to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that everything appearing in the newspaper fell from the reports. If some of what appears in the newspaper is established by the Crown to be content of the reports that would be sufficient for the Crown to have established that particular aspect of its case, because we are not talking about the question of who was the person who did the communication, we are just talking about whether or not there had been communication by some person. But relevant to that question, it is not necessary that you look at the newspaper article and be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that all that you read there came from the reports before you could find that the Crown succeeded on that one particular aspect of the case. If you came to the view beyond reasonable doubt that there was some content from the reports, of which exhibit A and exhibit B are the redacted copies, were published or found their way into the newspaper articles in exhibit F, that would be sufficient for that particular aspect of the Crown case.  
        
       
      
    68 In the written submissions filed on the appellant's behalf it was contended that the redirection was unnecessary and not responsive to the issues raised by the question in MFI 52. The answer to the question asked was that the material was not in evidence. The further directions, so it is said, had the potential to cause “further confusion to the jury”. Beyond this assertion, the submissions do not identify any error in the direction or expound on the respects in which the direction is said to have been susceptible of causing confusion. It was open to his Honour to consider that simply informing the jury that they could not have recourse to material that was not in evidence was an insufficient response to their query. There is no merit to this ground.  
     
      
      The admission of the appellant's emails 
       
      
    69 Mr Lowe objected to the tender of a printed copy of an email dated 9 June 2005 from “Allan Kessing” to “Donnata Scattolin” (exhibit M). The subject of the email was stated in the heading as “Out at Last”, the body of the email read as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Donna, perhaps you have heard on the grapevine that I finally quit. After all the argument with Beach over time off for my mom’s leukaemia needs, he had the gall to smarm at me on the first morning back “how’s your mum”. It was all I could do from flattening him then & there so I just typed out I RESIGN sent it via email and dropped a hardcopy on his desk before taking my place on the Line. Do you reckon I feel light & free???? I walked out of that air conditioned hellhole feeling like a 20 yr old and haven’t given it a moment thought since.  
        
       
       
        
        Except when I open my email and see your last so I shall ring you when I next have a window ‘twixt Mum and Margaret.  
        
       
       
        
        It feels so good I thoroughly recommend you pull the plug too, esp with the latest bullshit from John Anderson, $200M to upgrade airport security but we need a Pom to figure out how! I’d love to know who leaked the report to the press because there aren’t that many who would be privy to it, surely less than a dozen. I had to laugh when first all & sundry were denying it, then running for cover and now blowing the budget. Typical arse covering without actually doing anything effective, wotta surprise! 
        
       
      
    70 Mr Lowe submitted that the email was not relevant and, in the alternative, that it should be excluded in the exercise of the discretions under s 135 or s 137. (T'cpt 15/3/07 591.35-58) His Honour considered the relevance of the email to be its capacity to demonstrate that the appellant entertained feelings of acrimony towards the ACS. He asked Mr Lowe what unfair prejudice would be occasioned by its admission. Mr Lowe responded, “because in the scheme of life one is entitled to lose your temper”. (T'cpt 15/3/07 593.29-30) 
     
      
    71 Dr Glennon submitted that it was an error to admit exhibit M, since while it was capable of showing the appellant's hostile feelings towards Mr Beach, an individual, it was not capable of demonstrating acrimony towards the ACS as an organisation. While the contents of the email evidenced the appellant's resentment of Mr Beach’s attitude concerning his leave, it was capable of being understood as evidencing a wider disillusionment with the ACS at the material time. It was relevant to the question of whether the appellant had a motive to seek to embarrass the ACS by the exposure of the matters that were the subject of the Risk Analysis. It was not incumbent on the Crown to prove a motive, however, this is not to say that evidence capable of establishing a motive was not relevant. No danger of unfair prejudice was identified in the course of the submissions at the time the objection was taken. His Honour did not err in concluding that the probative value of exhibit M was not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant.  
     
      
    72 A bundle of emails relating to the appellant's unauthorised absence from work were admitted (exhibit E). Dr Glennon submitted that it was an error to admit these documents because they were not relevant to any issue in the trial. The emails were capable of establishing that in the period leading up to his resignation the relationship between the appellant and his superiors within the ACS was a poor one. In the Crown’s submission, they were evidence demonstrating that the appellant was a disgruntled and insubordinate employee, possessed of a motive to embarrass the ACS. Dr Glennon submitted that this construction was not supportable. Rather, he submitted that the emails showed the ACS accommodating the appellant by the provision of extended leave. This was a question for the jury. The correspondence was plainly capable of bearing the complexion which the Crown advanced. There is no substance to grounds 9 and 10. 
     
      
       
      The proviso 
       
      
    73 The appellant has established that there was a wrong decision on a question of law within the meaning of s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). The Crown submitted that in the event the Court found error, the appeal should nonetheless be dismissed under the proviso in s 6(1) in that no substantial miscarriage of justice actually occurred.  
     
      
    74 In deciding whether a substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred the Court must make its own independent assessment of the evidence and determine whether, making due allowance for the “natural limitations” that exist in proceeding wholly on the record, the guilt of the accused was established beyond reasonable doubt: Weiss v R [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300. As the Court explained in Weiss, this task is undertaken in the same way as the determination of whether the verdict of the jury should be set aside on the ground that it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence: at 316 [41].  
     
      
    75 In some cases the nature of the error made at trial is such that regardless of the assessment of the strength of the evidence it would be inappropriate to apply the proviso. Cases involving a significant denial of procedural fairness or where the consequence of the failure of process at trial has been to deprive the appellate court of the capacity to justly assess the strength of the case against the appellant provide examples of such instances: Weiss at 317 [45]; Nudd v R [2006] HCA 9; (2006) 80 ALJR 614 per Gleeson CJ. This is not a case involving error of those kinds. The erroneous direction did not involve such a departure from the essential requirements of the law as to go to the root of the proceedings: Wilde v R [1988] HCA 6; (1987-1988) 164 CLR 365 per Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 373.  
     
      
    76 The appellant contends that the verdict was unreasonable and cannot be supported by the evidence. The Crown submits that the case overwhelmingly established the guilt of the appellant, such that the wrong direction was not productive of a substantial miscarriage. Both contentions require this Court to undertake an independent assessment of the evidence. The Court is required to undertake the same exercise, but the questions to be determined are different. The appellant's ground requires the Court to decide whether upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty: M v R [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487 per Mason CJ, Deane, Dawson and Toohey JJ at 493. The application of the proviso involves consideration of the negative proposition stated in Weiss, which is that it cannot be said that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred unless the appellate court is persuaded that the evidence properly admitted at trial proved beyond reasonable doubt the appellant's guilt of the offence: at 317 [44]. 
     
      
    77 In Gassy v R [2008] HCA 18; (2008) 82 ALJR 838 Gummow and Hayne JJ at 848 [35] noted that the jury in that case had deliberated for a relatively lengthy time. Their Honours observed that the difficulties the jury experienced suggested a need for caution on the part of an appellate court before concluding on a review of the record that the offence charged was proved beyond reasonable doubt. That is a caution which is to be borne in mind in assessing the Crown’s submission in this case that the appeal should be dismissed pursuant to the proviso. There was a lengthy retirement in this case. 
     
      
    78 Dr Glennon’s submission in support of the ground that the verdict could not be supported on the evidence did not descend to an analysis of the evidence. The submissions were focussed on what were said to be the factual and legal similarities between this case and Kelly. In Kelly the Court of Appeal, by majority, directed an acquittal. An assertion that a verdict cannot be supported by the evidence necessarily turns upon the facts of the case and is not helpfully advanced by reference to the outcome of an appeal in a case involving different facts. It is to be noted that in Kelly there was evidence of telephone contact between Mr Kelly and the journalist who had received a leaked copy of a draft ministerial statement. That circumstance may be thought similar to one circumstance in this case. Some dissimilarities between the two include that the draft ministerial statement had been furnished by email to about 300 employees of the Department of Veterans’ Affairs throughout Australia. No security was attached to the emails and hardcopies of the attachments had been printed. After the decision to withdrawn the information there had been no systematic recovery of the hardcopies. The journalists to whom the statement had been leaked were based in Canberra and Mr Kelly was based in Melbourne.  
     
      
    79 A comparison of the copy of The Australian for 31 May 2005, exhibit F, with the redacted copies of the Risk Analysis and the Threat Assessment reports clearly demonstrates that the author/s of the articles had access to the contents of at least the Risk Analysis report. The central question is whether the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that it was the appellant who communicated the contents of the report/s to the author/s of the articles.  
     
      
    80 The Crown relies on the following circumstances to prove the intentional communication of the contents of the Risk Analysis: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) The appellant was a former ACS officer who had worked in the secure area known as the Air Border Security (ABS) team.  
        
       
       
        
        (b) Each of the reports had been authored by his superior officer, Ms Magni, during the time when the appellant was a member of that team. 
        
       
       
        
        (c) The appellant, with other members of the ABS team, had worked collaboratively on certain parts of the reports during their compilation. He had worked as a researcher for the first report, the  
        Threat Assessment 
         report (exhibit A).  
        
       
       
        
        (d) As a member of the ABS team, the appellant received, or had access to, copies of both reports for reading and review. These were provided in electronic and hardcopy. He had received electronic versions of the reports from Ms Magni and in respect of the  
        Risk Analysis 
         report had replied to Ms Magni via email with suggested amendments and comments.  
        
       
       
        
        (e) Copies of the reports, containing the text and content that was published in  
        The Australian 
         on 31 May 2005, were found in the premises in which the appellant was residing, his home residence and his mother’s residence, during the execution of search warrants on 6 September 2005. The  
        Threat Assessment 
         report (exhibit A) was located in a box in the bathroom of the appellant's home at 100 Darling Causeway, Mount Victoria and a copy of the  
        Risk Analysis 
         report (exhibit B) was located in an envelope on the floor, in the spare room of the appellant's mother’s home at 30 Lilydale Street, Marrickville.  
        
       
       
        
        (f) The appellant resigned from the ACS on 10 May 2005.  
        
       
       
        
        (g) There was evidence from which it was open to conclude that the appellant was a “disgruntled employee” with a motive to seek to embarrass the ACS or to publicly expose what he perceived to be its inaction regarding the subject matter of the reports.  
        
       
       
        
        (h) The business card bearing the name Martin Chulov was located during the search of the premises at XXXXX on the floor of the room in which the Threat Assessment report had been located. The business card bore the contact telephone numbers for Mr Chulov and an email address chulovm@theaustralian.com and the business address of  
        The Australian 
         printed on it.  
        
       
       
        
        (i) A notepad (exhibit N) on which were written Mr Chulov’s mobile telephone number and email address was located on a dresser next to the bed in the main bedroom of the appellant's home at Mount Victoria.  
        
       
       
        
        (i) Call charge records for the appellant's home land line service connected at 100 Darling Causeway, Mount Victoria revealed telephone calls made from that service to telephone numbers allocated to  
        The Australian 
         on seven occasions between 26 March and 28 May. The telephone calls varied in duration. A call on 24 May 2005 at 6:40pm was of 21 minutes 49 seconds duration. 
        
       
       
        
        (j) Call charge records for the land line telephone service connected to the appellant's mother’s home revealed a telephone call to a telephone number allocated to  
        The Australian 
         on 28 March 2005. 
        
       
       
        
        (k) Call charge records for a public telephone located in Lilydale Street recorded a call at 12:26pm on 30 May 2005 to the mobile telephone service identified as Martin Chulov’s service, the number recorded on the notepad found in the appellant's bedroom. The public telephone was approximately 70 metres from the appellant's mother’s home.  
        
       
       
        
        (l) The article published in  
        The Australian 
         on 31 May 2005 bore the name Martin Chulov in the by-line. 
        
       
       
      Each of these circumstances was established by unchallenged evidence that did not depend on an assessment of the credibility of witnesses. As I have noted, there is an issue concerning whether the evidence of the email communications established that the appellant was a person with a motive to seek to embarrass the ACS. In my opinion, the contents of the emails is eloquent of the fact that he was.  
       
      
    81 Ms Magni and each of the officers in the ABS Team at the time the two reports were prepared gave evidence at the trial. Each denied being the source of the communication. Ms Magni was cross-examined to establish that she was disgruntled in the way the ABS Team and the reports had been treated. She agreed that she had been unhappy about the fact that her small ABS Team was being subsumed into a larger group. She explained that her unhappiness arose from the lack of communication about how this transition was to take place. (T'cpt 19/3/07 646.19-27) At the time of giving evidence Ms Magni was still in the employ of the ACS. Members of the ABS Team who had been given access to the reports at the time of their preparation each stated that they had not forwarded electronic copies to anyone outside the ABS Team, nor had they made hardcopies of the reports. None had taken copies of the reports outside the secure ABS Team room.  
     
      
    82 Each officer who had worked within the ABS Team, between the time the reports were created and 31 May 2005, was called to give evidence, save for one officer, Peter Anastasi, who had left the ACS and who was understood to be out of the country. Each of these officers denied communicating the content of the reports to any person outside the ACS. Each gave evidence that they had access to the reports within the secure ABS Team room and that they had not made any copies of the reports nor taken copies of the reports out of the ABS Team room.  
     
      
    83 Ms Magni had supplied hardcopies of the Threat Assessment and Risk Analysis reports to her immediate supervisor, Mr Pappas. Copies of the reports had been furnished to Mr Pappas’ superiors. Copies had been sent electronically to identified senior officers of ACS. Each of the officers who had received a copy of one or more of the reports was called and gave evidence denying that they had communicated the contents of the reports to person outside the ACS.  
     
      
    84 Contrary to the appellant's submissions, the evidence did not establish that prior to 31 May 2005 copies of the reports had been distributed to the AFP, other law enforcement agencies or the Airports Corporation. Ms Oderberg, the ACS liaison officer attached to the AFP, had been supplied with a document, but this was not a copy of either of the reports. The document that Ms Oderberg had communicated to the AFP was authored by Jess Hemmings. Mr Max Moore-Wilton, of the Airports Corporation was supplied with a copy of the reports, but this did not occur prior to the publication in The Australian on 31 May 2005.  
     
      
    85 The evidence showed that a number of persons within the ACS had been given hardcopies or electronic copies of one or both of the reports. It did not establish that no person other than the appellant could have communicated the contents of the reports to Martin Chulov or any other person at The Australian. The fact that the appellant had taken home copies of each report demonstrated that the security measures adopted by Ms Magni and her superiors were not failsafe.  
     
      
    86 The evidence established that the Threat Assessment and the Risk Analysis reports were treated within ACS as confidential documents with restrictions on the circulation of each. The evidence of the security measures adopted with respect to the reports was a circumstance to be taken into account in considering as a rational hypothesis that another officer within the relatively small group of persons who had access to the reports had also taken a copy of each, or at least the Risk Analysis report, from the secure ACS offices at the airport. It was not without significance that the appellant undoubtedly had taken copies of each report from the secure ABS Team room and kept them at his places of residence, notwithstanding his obligation to return material at the time he ceased his employment with the Commonwealth.  
     
      
    87 This was a powerful circumstantial case in which the overwhelming inference was that the appellant was the person who communicated the contents of the reports (or at least of the Risk Analysis report) to Mr Chulov. I am satisfied that the Crown established the appellant's guilt of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. Notwithstanding the erroneous direction given by the trial judge in answer to the questions asked by the jury, I have concluded that no substantial miscarriage of justice actually occurred and, accordingly, I propose that the appeal be dismissed.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: Adam Patrick Owens pleaded guilty to the murder of his mother, Doris Owens, when he was arraigned on the date fixed for trial. He asked through his solicitor to be sentenced that day and sought to put no mitigating material or submissions before the Court. Over his objection, I ordered a pre-sentence report and stood the proceedings over to 5 December 2008 for further hearing on sentence. 
     
      
    2 The Crown tendered a statement of agreed facts, a criminal history disclosing that the offender has no prior convictions, a pre-sentence report and extracts from medical records of the offender. The pre-sentence report indicates that the offender politely declined to provide any details of his life or the circumstances of the offence and that he did not want anything to mitigate the lengthy sentence he expects to receive. 
     
      
    3 A victim impact statement was provided to the Court in writing and parts of it were read to the Court. The offender gave evidence, principally to rebut matters of mitigation identified in written submissions provided by the Crown. No other material was put before the Court. The offender was represented by a solicitor at the sentence hearing who repeated, as he had previously indicated when the plea of guilty was entered, that the offender did not wish to make any submissions on sentence. The offender himself, in his sworn evidence, submitted that the Court should impose the maximum penalty, which is imprisonment for life.  
     
      
    4 The circumstance of the offender seeking to maximise rather than to moderate the sentence to be imposed is contrary to the common experience of the Court and invites attention to the question whether the plea of guilty and the evidence on sentence were given freely by a person of sound mind. The offender had apparently anticipated such a concern before he entered his plea. In response to a question from the Crown directed to his health in recent years, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In anticipation of you going down this path, we have a report that says I know precisely what I am doing and you have nothing to suggest otherwise. At the time of the offence I knew what I was doing. At the moment, and in the last couple of years with regard to the conduct of this matter, I have known precisely what I am doing. Please stop trying to mitigate the offence.” 
        
       
      
    5 The offender’s evidence on sentence disclosed that he is a highly intelligent and articulate man who wishes to take full responsibility for his acts. His concern to emphasise the absence of mitigating features appeared to me to be a matter of conscience rather than an aspect of unsoundness of mind. I do not think I have any option but to sentence him on the strength of the limited material he has chosen to have placed before me.  
     
      
       
      Circumstances of the offence 
       
      
    6 The deceased was the natural mother of the offender. She was 69 years old at the time of her death. The offender was then aged 32 years and is the elder of her two sons. The deceased used to divide her time between a unit in Woollahra and a holiday home in Swanhaven. Police attended the house at Swanhaven on 12 September 2006 after her younger son raised concerns as to her whereabouts. They found her body in her bed. An autopsy disclosed that she had died as a result of stab wounds to the chest and torso area damaging her heart, aorta and other organs. There appear to have been four stab wounds that penetrated the torso from the front and three other wounds, two of which were described as superficial. The pathologist also noted a number of what were described as “defensive-type wounds” to the left forearm and fingers. He also found that a number of the deceased’s ribs were fractured. 
     
      
    7 On the morning of the 8th of September, the offender had called a taxi from a public telephone at Cudmirrah, which is about 2 kilometres from his mother’s house at Swanhaven. The taxi took him to the Manildra ethanol factory at Bomaderry, where he stayed for a short time before returning to Sydney, apparently by train. 
     
      
    8 In two interviews with police the offender claimed that he was in Sydney during the time when his mother was killed. When CCTV footage from Bomaderry contradicted those claims, police were granted authority to conduct a controlled operation in which the offender’s brother met the offender on nine occasions using a listening device. During the ninth meeting, the offender told his brother that “of course” he was there and “of course” he did it.  
     
      
    9 He said that after he stabbed his mother, he went in and out of the bedroom a few times, then partially covered her body with the bed clothes and left. He said he did not know where he threw the knife or how he got to Cudmirrah. He said this memory had become clear over time. He did not know why he had gone to Manildra rather than directly to the station, but said he must have been trying to conceal where he was going. Most curiously, the offender told his brother that he was “absolutely certain” that he had killed the deceased and that he had a very clear recollection of being associated with those moments. Those remarks suggest that the offender may previously have entertained a doubt as to whether it was he who killed his mother, and that he was disassociated with other events surrounding the offence, but there is no material before me on that issue.  
     
      
       
      Findings as to the offender’s state of mind  
       
      
    10 In his sworn evidence at the sentence hearing, the offender said that the version of events he gave his brother during that conversation did not reflect what occurred. The account given by the offender to his brother was that, on the way to the holiday house, the deceased had berated the offender over a lost job offer, telling him that he was useless and was “doing it all wrong”. He told his brother that the conversation continued for hours, starting up again the next morning, and that he wanted the deceased to stop screaming at him. He said that he had a sharp knife in his hand and that, before he had time to think about what he was doing, he stabbed her but that he did not do it deliberately and that if he had had an instant to think about it, he would not have done it.  
     
      
    11 At the sentence hearing, the offender said that it would be very much on his conscience if I took the view that the killing occurred as a result of some loss of temper on his part. He said that was most definitely not the case. I accept, on the strength of that evidence, that his culpability is not moderated by any provocation or loss of self-control. 
     
      
    12 The offender also sought to disabuse me of the impression he gave his brother that he had travelled to Swanhaven with the deceased. He stated that he did not propose to explain how he travelled to Swanhaven, but said “if people travel by covert or clandestine means, then surely they must be up to no good. If your Honour were to draw, from that, conclusions relating to pre-meditation, that would almost certainly be quite correct.”  
     
      
    13 It is difficult to know what to make of that quaint concession. In some aspects of the offender’s evidence concerning his state of mind, he was quite frank, indeed almost boastful. Conversely, there was his curious statement to his brother that he was “absolutely certain” that he had killed the deceased. There is no evidence before me as to how the offender travelled to Swanhaven, whether by clandestine means or otherwise. He did not accept that he went there specifically for the purpose of killing his mother. There is a suggestion in the evidence that he does not have a complete recollection of events. I do not know whether his equivocation on that issue is truthful or manipulative, or both, but I am left in the position that I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, on the evidence before me, as to whether the offender had formulated a plan to kill his mother before he left Sydney.14 The offender gave evidence that he intended to kill his mother. However, he disputed the Crown’s submission that the offence involved gratuitous cruelty. He said he did not intend to inflict cruelty and certainly not gratuitous cruelty. He said that he was attempting to effect the act as promptly as possible, but that it was more difficult to execute than one might imagine. He indicated that he did not, by that evidence, intend to mitigate his sentence but only to be accurate. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did intend to kill his mother when he stabbed her, but I can make no finding as to when he formed that intention. I am not satisfied that the commission of the offence entailed gratuitous cruelty. That phrase denotes a level of additional cruelty beyond that which is inherent in the commission of the offence. I am not satisfied that was a feature of the present offence.  
     
      
    15 On the issue of remorse, the offender said he was not in the least remorseful, nor was he repentant. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Given the time over, I would do the same again. I regret perhaps not having done it 20 odd years earlier when the idea first occurred to me, and I think you ought to be aware of that”.  
        
       
      
    16 He said that there was no psychopathy in him and that he is quite capable of remorse but that it is not a factor in the present case. 
     
      
    17 In respect of the medical records, the offender stated that there is nothing to suggest his mental health was impaired at the time of the offence and that, even if there were, it would not be a defence or even a mitigating factor. He said “it is only a bit of depression”. I have considered the contents of the medical records carefully. They consist mainly of notes made at various times when the offender has been admitted to hospitals for psychiatric care. They tend to confirm, as the offender said, that he has had some depression in the past. The notes also suggest the possibility that he has a narcissistic personality disorder but I am unable to make any finding as to whether that is the case. I have a sense of unease as to this aspect of the matter, but I do not think I have any option but to proceed on the basis contended for by the offender that his moral culpability for the offence is not mitigated by any mental illness that may have been present at the time of the offence. 
     
      
       
      The plea of guilty 
       
      
    18 The offender indicated that he deliberately deferred entering the plea of guilty until the first day of the trial so as to reduce its utilitarian value. He said that this was not due to any attempt on his part to incur a lengthy sentence but simply due to his belief that it is improper to discount a sentence for the utilitarian value of a plea. It is his view that the discount has become an instrument to extract testimony from accused people in hopeless situations against their own co-accused.  
     
      
    19 The offender’s evidence on that issue appeared to confuse the discount for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty with the discount for providing assistance to authorities. In any event, I am bound not by the offender’s opinions but by the applicable law, including s 22(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the analysis of that section by the Court of Criminal Appeal in the guideline judgment of R v Thomson; R v Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. 20 The Crown said in his written submissions that the appropriate discount for the plea should be assessed towards the bottom of the range proposed in the guideline judgment, that is, close to 10%. It was implicit in that submission that the Crown did not come to Court intending to seek the maximum penalty. However, after hearing the offender’s evidence, the Crown submitted that the offence was placed at the highest end of the range and warrants imprisonment for life.  
     
      
    21 The Crown did not address me as to s 61(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That section requires the Court to impose a sentence of imprisonment for life if satisfied that the level of culpability in the commission of the offence is so extreme that the community interest in retribution, punishment, community protection and deterrence can only be met through the imposition of that sentence. The burden of proving that a case falls within that section rests on the Crown and the standard of such proof is beyond reasonable doubt: R v Merritt [2004] NSWCCA 19 at [35]. 
     
      
    22 At common law, the maximum penalty is preserved for the worst case category. In order to characterise a case as being in that category, it must be possible to point to features of the case which are of very great heinousness and to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime as opposed to subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed: Merritt at [39]. The onus of establishing that the offence entails such extreme wickedness is on the Crown. 
     
      
    23 The basis for the Crown’s submission for a life sentence was that the offender’s evidence established that the killing was both intentional and pre-meditated or part of a planned criminal activity. The Crown also relied on the patent absence of remorse. I accept that the offender intended to kill his mother. However, that is not a matter in aggravation, since it is an element of the offence: Apps v R [2006] NSWCCA 290 per Hunt CJ at CL at [5]. An intention to kill cannot, taken alone, establish that a particular instance of the crime of murder falls in the worst case category, or even that it is above the mid-range of seriousness: see Apps per Simpson J at [49].  
     
      
    24 As to whether the offence was part of a planned or pre-meditated activity, the Crown invited me to infer that the offender set upon a path he had clearly in his mind for a period of 20 years. That was not the offender’s evidence. What he said in respect of the offence was that he regretted, perhaps, not having done it 20 odd years earlier when the idea first occurred to him. In cross-examination, he accepted the proposition that he had been contemplating killing his mother for at least 20 years. That was an extraordinary statement. Twenty years before the offence the offender was 12. I am hesitant to draw any firm inference from the offender’s evidence as to the period of pre-meditation. As previously noted, there is a suggestion in the medical notes that the offender has a narcissistic personality disorder. That evidence was not put before me in a form that enables me to make any positive finding about the offender’s mental state, but it is relevant to an assessment of the evidence he gave. I am concerned that some of the statements made by him were calculated to produce dramatic effect. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that I should infer that the offence had been pre-meditated for 20 years. I do, however, accept that the offender had previously contemplated killing his mother.  
     
      
    25 Apart from the factors of intention to kill and pre-meditation or planning, the Crown pointed to no matters to support the submission that the offender’s evidence at the sentence hearing placed his crime at the highest end of the range. I am not satisfied that the offender’s level of culpability is so extreme that it can only be met with a sentence of life imprisonment. In coming to this conclusion, I have had regard to a number of decisions in which life sentences have been imposed after a plea of guilty to murder, including Merritt and Knight v R [2006] NSWCCA 292. I have also considered the decision of R v Christov (No 2) [2006] NSWSC 1179 where Kirby J was of the view, and the Crown had not submitted otherwise, that a murder he rightly described as brutal and horrifying was nonetheless not within the worst category.  
     
      
       
       
       
      The appropriate sentence 
      
    26 I must therefore fix a term of imprisonment and a non-parole period. The offence of murder carries a standard non-parole period of 20 years. It is well established that the standard non-parole period does not apply to a conviction entered pursuant to a plea of guilty, which the Act contemplates will attract a discount. Nonetheless, it remains relevant as a matter of guidance: R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 at [68]; [122]. It is appropriate, therefore, to consider the objective seriousness of the offence having regard to aggravating and mitigating factors relating to the offence (including the offender’s state of mind).  
     
      
    27 I acknowledge, especially to the offender’s brother Dr Owens, that this must appear to be a callous exercise but it is one the Court is required to undertake in order to determine the appropriate sentence.  
     
      
    28 As to matters of aggravation, as noted by the Crown, the offence involved violence and the use of a weapon. The offender stabbed his mother, a 69 year old woman, in her home. I am unable to make any finding as to his reason or motive for doing so. I have indicated that I am not satisfied that the offence involved gratuitous cruelty, nor am I able to make any finding as to the extent to which it was planned. I accept that there was a degree of pre-meditation.  
     
      
    29 There are no mitigating factors in the circumstances of the offence (as opposed to the circumstances of the offender).  
     
      
    30 The Crown referred me to the decision of R v Barbetta [2008] NSWSC 688. That was a case in which the Crown conceded the offence fell below the mid-range in seriousness. The sentencing Judge was not satisfied that the offender intended to kill and there was an element of provocation in the form of racist taunts directed towards the offender’s parents. The sentencing Judge also accepted that the offender was remorseful. 
     
      
    31 I have also considered R v O’Connor [2008] NSWSC 1297 where Studdert J concluded that the offence was below the middle of the range of objective seriousness, albeit not by much. His Honour referred specifically to the lack of pre-meditation, an absence of planning and the fact that the offender was subjected to some loss of self-control. 
     
      
    32 The intention to kill and the absence of provocation or loss of self-control establish a higher level of moral culpability in the present case, although neither is an aggravating factor within the meaning of s 21A. I must also have regard to the fact that there was a degree of pre-meditation in the present case. I have come to the view that the present offence is within the middle of the range of objective seriousness but at the high end of that range.  
     
      
    33 The next issue is to consider whether there are matters that warrant moderating the sentence that is otherwise appropriate. The first matter is the fact that the offender has pleaded guilty, albeit on the date fixed for trial. It does not follow, from his opinion as to the impropriety of such a discount, that he is disentitled to receive it. I accept the Crown’s original submission that a discount in the order of 10% is appropriate to reflect the utilitarian value of the plea. 
     
      
    34 As to the offender’s personal circumstances, I have very little information. The medical notes record that he has worked as a political advisor here and in New Zealand. He has intermittently suffered from depression, which according to the medical notes has sometimes been severe, but I do not think he falls into the category of offender for whom general deterrence is inappropriate by reason of mental illness. It is difficult to ascertain whether incarceration will be more burdensome for him than would otherwise be expected by reason of his depression but even if that is the case, I do not think his sentence should be moderated on that account to any great degree.  
     
      
    35 I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. Although he has frankly acknowledged an intention to kill in this case, it appears that was due to specific aspects of his relationship with the deceased. The Crown accepted that he is a person of good character with no prior convictions. Notwithstanding the offender’s protestations to the contrary, those are all matters to be taken into account in mitigation of the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    36 As I have noted, a victim impact statement was read to the Court by the deceased’s other son, Dr Owens. It was an articulate expression of the pain and grief that has been inflicted on him by the violent death of his mother at the hands of his half-brother. Although I can convey the sympathy of the Court to Dr Owens, the law does not permit me to take the effect of the death on him into account to increase the sentence that is to be imposed: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76 at 87. I acknowledge that no sentence the Court can impose will be adequate to vindicate Dr Owens’ pain and loss. 
     
      
    37 I have considered whether I should adjust the statutory relationship between the non-parole period and the balance of term so as to provide a longer period for supervision and assistance to the offender in returning to the community. I have come to the view that, having regard to the length of the sentence to be imposed, the parole period according to the statutory ratio will afford adequate time for such supervision.  
     
      
    38 Adam Patrick Owens, I sentence you to a term of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 17 years commencing on 5 March 2007 and a balance of term of 6 years. You will be eligible to be considered for release to parole upon the expiration of the non-parole period on 4 March 2024. The full term of the sentence will expire on 4 March 2030.

    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Hidden J.2 HULME J: I agree with Hidden J 
     
      
    3 HIDDEN J: The appellant, John Lapa, appeals against sentences imposed upon him by his Honour, Judge Barnett in the Drug Court of New South Wales. The sentences the subject of the application are as follows: 
     
      
    · On a charge of break, enter and steal (s112(1) of the Crimes Act) imprisonment for 23 months, comprising a non-parole period of 17 months and a balance of term of 6 months, to date from 24 August 2006;  
     
      
    · On a charge of supplying heroin (s25(1) and s29 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act), imprisonment for 5 years, comprising a non-parole period of 3½ years and a balance of term of 1½ years, to date from 9 November 2006. 
     
      
       
      The overall sentence is a little over 5 years and 2 months, with an effective non-parole period of a little over 3 years and 8 months. The total sentence would expire on 8 November 2011, and he would be eligible for release on parole on 8 May 2010. 
       
      
    4 To understand the length of the first sentence, and the commencement date of both of them, it will be necessary to sketch the history of the proceedings. Provision for appeals to this Court against sentences imposed in the Drug Court is to be found in s5AF of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. At the outset of the hearing a question was raised about how the Court should be constituted for the appeal in respect of the sentence for the break, enter and steal offence, given that it had been dealt with summarily: s5AF(1)(b), (3)(b). That question need not be pursued, as it was resolved by a direction of the Chief Justice under subs(3)(b) that the matter be dealt with by a three-judge bench. 5 On 1 December 2004, the appellant appeared before his Honour, Judge Dive for initial sentence, pursuant to s7(as it then stood) of the Drug Court Act 1998, for the break, enter and steal offence and a number of other summary offences. Those other offences are not the subject of this appeal, and need not concern us. He pleaded guilty to the break, enter and steal, and his Honour dealt with the matter summarily under Chapter 5 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. As a Table 1 offence under schedule 1 to that Act, he was liable to a maximum sentence of 2 years imprisonment: s267.  
     
      
    6 The offence occurred on 10 May 2004, when the appellant broke into a chemist shop at Toongabbie. He removed a large quantity of prescription drugs and other items, but was intercepted by police when he was leaving the store with them. 
     
      
    7 The appellant was 25 years old when he committed this offence, and he is now 29. He had a significant criminal history, including offences of dishonesty and drug offences. He had previously served short terms of imprisonment, and at the time of the subject offence was subject to good behaviour bonds associated with suspended sentences imposed in the Local Court only about a month previously. 
     
      
    8 Judge Dive found that the offence involved “very little planning”, and considered the appellant entitled “to the full utilitarian value” of his plea of guilty. It appears that his Honour would have imposed a sentence of 2 years, comprising a non-parole period of 18 months and a balance of term of 6 months. It was in the light of a discrete period of pre-sentence custody of about a month that he reduced the non-parole period to 17 months, resulting in the sentence of 23 months.  That sentence was suspended so as to enable the appellant to enter the Drug Court treatment plan. 
     
      
    9 Unfortunately, he did not fare well. Among other things, between October 2005 and November 2006 he committed a number of further offences, including the offence of supplying heroin the subject of this appeal. Again, the other offences were summary matters which need not be considered. He came before his Honour at the end of March 2007, his Drug Court program having then been terminated. He was sentenced on 27 April 2007.  
     
      
    10 Pursuant to s12 of the Drug Court Act, Judge Barnett passed a final sentence for the break, enter and steal offence by confirming the initial sentence imposed by Judge Dive: subs (3)(b). The commencement date for that sentence of 24 August 2006 was agreed between the parties, having regard to sanctions imposed upon the appellant and periods of pre-sentence custody required to be taken into account by s12(2). Included in that computation was the period of continuous custody since his arrest on 9 November 2006 for the drug supply offence.  
     
      
    11 Put shortly, that offence arose from his possession of 5.14 grams of heroin, contained in balloons wrapped in plastic and concealed on his person. At this time he was 27 years old. The drug was found by police when he was searched on the day of his arrest. The surrounding circumstances conveyed that he had been involved with an accomplice in supplying heroin in the Parramatta area. His Honour saw the offence as part of a planned criminal activity and noted, of course, that it was committed while he was on conditional liberty under the Drug Court program. 
     
      
    12 The 5-year sentence for that offence was directed to commence on the day of his arrest, 9 November 2006. There is thus a significant measure of concurrency between the two sentences, the sentence for the break, enter and steal commencing roughly 2½ months before the sentence for the supply offence and thereafter being wholly subsumed within it. His Honour did not quantify a reduction of sentence for the supply offence because of the plea of guilty but, while noting the strength of the Crown case, he took the plea into account “as a sign of his contrition and as having a high utilitarian value”.  
     
      
       
      The appeal 
      
    13 Counsel for the appellant, Ms Francis, submitted that both sentences are manifestly excessive and that in relation to the sentence for the drug offence, his Honour failed to give adequate weight to evidence disclosing special circumstances warranting a variation of the statutory ratio between sentence and non-parole period. Her argument concerning the sentence for the break, enter and steal offence centred upon a jurisdictional question, and it is convenient to deal with that first.14 By s112 of the Crimes Act, that offence carries a maximum sentence of 14 years imprisonment. However, as I have said, because the appellant’s offence was being dealt with summarily the maximum sentence his Honour could impose was 2 years imprisonment. It is effectively that term which Judge Dive imposed and Judge Barnett confirmed.  
     
      
    15 However, as noted, Judge Dive said that the appellant was entitled to the full utilitarian value of his plea of guilty. No doubt, that was a reference to a discount of 25 per cent, the top of the range of discount for the utilitarian value of a plea envisaged in R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383. That being so, his Honour’s starting point of sentence must have been 2 years and 8 months. Ms Francis submitted that such an approach exceeded his Honour’s jurisdiction, because that starting point was greater than the maximum sentence available to him. 
     
      
    16 The answer to that submission is to be found in a case to which the Crown prosecutor referred us, R v Doan [2000] NSWCCA 317, 50 NSWLR 115. That case was concerned with s27 of the Criminal Procedure Act as it then stood, the equivalent of the present s267. The issue was whether the two-year maximum available to a magistrate was confined to a “worst case” appropriate for summary disposal. That proposition was rejected by Grove J, with whom Spigelman CJ and Kirby J agreed. After a review of interstate authority, his Honour expressed his conclusion in this way: 
     
      
       
        
        35 The result of true construction of the statutory provisions in New South Wales is that, what has been prescribed is a jurisdictional maximum and not a maximum penalty for any offence triable within that jurisdiction. In other words, where the maximum applicable penalty is lower because the charge has been prosecuted within the limited summary jurisdiction of the Local Court, that court should impose a penalty reflecting the objective seriousness of the offence, tempered if appropriate by subjective circumstances, taking care only not to exceed the maximum jurisdictional limit. The implication of the argument of the appellant that, in lieu of prescribed maximum penalties exceeding two years imprisonment, a maximum of two years imprisonment for all offences triable summarily in the Local Court has been substituted, must be rejected. As must also be rejected, the corollary that a sentence of two years imprisonment should be reserved for a ""worst case"". 
        
       
      
    17 By parity of reasoning, it was open to Judge Dive in the present case to determine a starting point of sentence above the two-year jurisdictional limit. The only constraint imposed upon him by the relevant provision of the Criminal Procedure Act was that the sentence actually passed could not exceed 2 years. Accordingly, his Honour’s approach was not in error.  
     
      
    18 Otherwise, Ms Francis submitted that the sentence for the drug supply offence is manifestly excessive, given the small quantity involved (5.14 grams). Again, she noted that Judge Barnett had found the appellant’s plea of guilty to this offence as having high utilitarian value. Assuming that that plea also earned him a reduction of the order of 25 per cent, the starting point of sentence must have been about 6½ years. 
     
      
    19 Generally, Ms Francis argued that the two sentences are excessive in their totality, and fail to give adequate weight to the period of roughly 2 years that the appellant was in the Drug Court program and such progress as he made during that period. He had had a difficult background, which it is not necessary to recite, and Ms Francis submitted that at the time Judge Barnett sentenced him he was at an age where his rehabilitation would have been fostered by a significantly longer period of parole eligibility than that allowed by his Honour. 
     
      
    20 However, the offence of supplying heroin was not that of a user/dealer, but was in the context of a commercial venture. It was committed while the appellant was on the conditional liberty of the Drug Court program, which his Honour rightly described as “a seriously aggravating feature…”.  The sentence for that offence of 5 years with a non-parole period of 3½ years represents a limited departure from the statutory ratio, but his Honour made it clear that he did so only because of the measure of the accumulation of that sentence upon the sentence for the break, enter and steal. He was not prepared to find special circumstances otherwise because of the appellant’s “betrayal of the opportunity for rehabilitation”, adopting the expression of Wood CJ at CL in R v Tran [1999] NSWCCA 109 at [15]. 
     
      
    21 His Honour determined the sentences, and the structure of them, after a careful review of the applicant’s background and his progress through the Drug Court program. I can find no error in his approach and I am not persuaded that this Court’s intervention is called for. 
     
      
    22 I would dismiss the appeal.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BELL JA: I will ask Johnson J to deliver the first judgment. 
     
      
    2 JOHNSON J: On 9 December 2008, the Court as presently constituted gave judgment with respect to appeals against conviction arising from three separate trials. The appeals against conviction with respect to two trials were dismissed: Makarov v R (No. 1) [2008] NSWCCA 291; Makarov v R (No. 2) [2008] NSWCCA 292. The appeal against conviction was allowed with respect to the third trial, with consequential orders being made quashing the convictions and sentences and ordering new trials: Makarov v R (No. 3) [2008] NSWCCA 293.  
     
      
    3 Because of the orders of the Court in Makarov v R (No. 3), application is made to the Court under s.59 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 to vary the date of commencement of a number of sentences imposed upon the Appellant for offences in relation to which the appeal against conviction was dismissed. 
     
      
    4 The unsuccessful appeal in Makarov v R (No. 1) concerned offences committed by the Appellant against D. For these offences, on 28 January 2005, her Honour Judge Latham (as her Honour then was) sentenced the Appellant to an effective head sentence of 12 years’ imprisonment to date from 10 December 2004 and to expire on 9 December 2016 with a non-parole period of eight years to date from 10 December 2004 and to expire on 9 December 2012. Those sentences remain undisturbed following the appeal.  
     
      
    5 The unsuccessful appeal against conviction in Makarov v R (No. 2) related to offences against A. On 11 November 2005, her Honour Judge Hock sentenced the Appellant for those offences to an aggregate sentence of eight years’ imprisonment to date from 10 December 2012 with an effective non-parole period of four years to expire on 9 December 2016. The present s.59 application relates to these sentences. 
     
      
    6 The successful appeal against conviction in Makarov v R (No. 3) concerned offences against B and C. On 11 November 2005, her Honour Judge Hock sentenced the Appellant for these offences to an aggregate term of nine years’ imprisonment to date from 10 December 2009 with an effective non-parole period of six years to expire on 9 December 2015. These sentences were quashed as a result of the successful conviction appeal.  
     
      
    7 Section 59 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “59  
        Court may vary commencement of sentence on quashing or varying other sentence 
         
         
          
          (1) A court that quashes or varies a sentence of imprisonment imposed on a person (on appeal or otherwise) may vary the date of commencement of any other sentence that has been imposed on that person by that or any other court. 
           
           
          (2) If a person is subject to two or more sentences, this section applies to each of them. 
           
           
          (3) A court may vary a sentence under this section on its own initiative or on the application of a party to the proceedings on the quashing or variation of the other sentence. 
           
           
          (4) An appeal does not lie merely because the date of commencement of a sentence is varied under this section. 
           
           
          (5) The term of a sentence, or the non-parole period of a sentence, cannot be varied under this section.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    8 The predecessor provisions to the present s.59, and their rationale, were considered in R v O’Donohue (No. 2) [2001] NSWCCA 495. Thereafter, s.59 was amended by the Crimes Legislation Amendment Act 2003 to enable variation of the commencement date of “any other sentence” and not only a “consecutive sentence”. Section 59 in its present form was considered by this Court in R v Pham [2004] NSWCCA 263. There, Spigelman CJ (Hidden and Buddin JJ agreeing) held that, in the context of an appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, the word “court” in s.59(1) meant the Court of Criminal Appeal as an institution, and not the individual judges who constituted the bench in a particular matter. With respect to the function of the Court under s.59, the Chief Justice observed at [9]-[10]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[9] Section 59 is a provision designed to serve pragmatic purposes: to ensure the efficiency and expedition of the administration of criminal justice. Its clear purpose is to permit variations consequential upon a sentence of imprisonment being set in a second matter by reference to the dates of the sentence imposed in the first matter. The pragmatic purpose of s 59 would be best served if the word ‘court’ is given a liberal construction so that the section is able to be applied with minimum cost and inconvenience. 
         
         
        [10] Its purpose is, in part, to ensure that it is not necessary to bring a further appeal in the second matter in circumstances where what is involved is, in the normal course, a mechanical exercise. That purpose is best served by ensuring that the task can be performed with a minimum degree of difficulty of an administrative character. …” 
        
       
      
    9 The s.59 function does not involve this Court proceeding as if on an application for leave to appeal against sentence under ss.5(1)(c) and 6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. The term of a sentence or a non-parole period cannot be varied under the section: s.59(5). Rather, the Court is exercising the narrow and essentially mechanical task of varying the date of commencement of sentence. As the Chief Justice observed in R v Pham at [14], there may be cases in which factual disputes arise, for example, as to what allowance is to be made for the circumstance that a person may have been in custody for more than one reason. In this case, it has been necessary to consider the reasons for the Appellant being in custody at various times, clearly being the product of the various sentences which have been imposed. The Court has heard submissions today with respect to those issues. 
     
      
    10 Her Honour Judge Hock sentenced the Appellant at the same time on 11 November 2005 for the offences committed against A, B and C. A single set of remarks on sentence encompassed the sentencing decision for all these offences. By that time, the Appellant had been sentenced by her Honour Judge Latham for the offences against D. Before imposing individual sentences, her Honour Judge Hock observed (ROS10): 
     
      
       
        
        “I have fixed the appropriate sentence for each offence and then considered the questions of cumulation or concurrence. There will be partial accumulation of sentences, including the sentences previously imposed, in order to reflect the principle of totality. I have found special circumstances because there is accumulation of sentences. However, the overall sentence is in accordance with the statutory ratio, as this period will provide adequately for the offender’s reintegration into the community. In my view, no lesser non-parole period than that imposed would reflect the very serious criminality displayed by the offender over these years and in respect of the four complaints.” 
        
       
      
    11 On the present application, Mr Giddy, for the Appellant, submits that the appropriate order to be made under s 59 would see a variation of the date of commencement of the sentences for the offences against A, involving a reduction of the additional non-parole period by a period of more than half. 
     
      
    12 The Crown accepts that there should be some adjustment of the commencement date to take into account the fact that the convictions have been quashed with respect to the counts concerning B and C. The Crown notes that multiple victims and discrete offending usually require partially consecutive sentences, and it is to be expected that the total effective sentence imposed by her Honour Judge Hock was increased by the offending against B and C. The Crown submits that any adjustment should ensure that the adjusted commencement date provides for a total effective sentence that reflects the high objective criminality of the offending in this matter.  
     
      
    13 The submissions made today, within the confines of s.59, have touched upon issues of totality, concurrence and accumulation and indirectly, special circumstances. 
     
      
    14 Having regard to the submissions made, in all the circumstances, I am satisfied that the appropriate order in this case is to vary the date of commencement of the sentences for offences against A so that they commence on 10 December 2010, and not 10 December 2012. Accordingly, I propose orders varying the date of commencement of sentences imposed upon the Appellant on 11 November 2005 for offences committed against A as follows: 
     
      
       
      (a) with respect to Counts 1, 2 and 4, the sentence of imprisonment for three years is to date from 10 December 2010 and to expire on 9 December 2013; 
       
       
      (b) as to Counts 5 and 6, the sentence of imprisonment for four years is to date from 10 December 2010 and to expire on 9 December 2014; 
       
       
      (c) as to Counts 3 and 7, the non-parole period of four years is to commence on 10 December 2010 and to expire on 9 December 2014 with a balance of term of two years to commence on 10 December 2014 and to expire on 9 December 2016; 
       
       
      (d) as to Count 8, the non-parole period of four years is to commence on 10 December 2010 and to expire on 9 December 2014 with a balance of term of four years to commence on 10 December 2014 and to expire on 9 December 2018. 
       
      
    15 Upon the basis of these varied commencement dates, the earliest date upon which the Appellant will be eligible for release on parole is 9 December 2014. 
     
      
    16 BELL JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Johnson J for the reasons that his Honour gives.17 MCCALLUM J: I also agree with the order proposed by Johnson J for the reasons he gives.18 BELL JA: The orders of the Court are as Johnson J has proposed.

    JUDGMENT1. This is a case about a young man who has quite uncharacteristically committed a very serious crime. Two of the important features in this sentencing are the seriousness of the crime and the significance of the young man’s contrition. The young man is Joseph Sahyoun.2. When he was twenty years of age and at university and working in his father’s tobacconist shop, he attracted the attention of a fourteen year old school girl. When I say that, I mean that they became mutually attracted to each other. She used to call in to see him at his work. They used to embrace and kiss one another.3. On 11 April 2007, she came to his work and he offered to drive her home. On the way home they parked near a park. They began kissing again and then decided to get into the backseat. He asked whether she wanted to have sexual intercourse. As the agreed facts say, the complainant “said she didn’t and wanted to wait until she was married. The offender continued to ask the complainant questions regarding her sexuality and virginity and eventually the complainant agreed to have sexual intercourse.”4. They both got undressed and he penetrated her with his penis into her vagina. It was a very painful experience for the complainant. He removed his penis and put on a condom and reinserted his penis and continued with the act of intercourse. It stopped because the complainant’s sister phoned her twice during the sexual encounter. They stopped, got dressed and he drove her home. They continued to see one another for another month or so.5. In November that year the complainant reported the matter to the police. Mr Sayhoun was arrested. He initially denied the offences. 6. What he did is a crime against s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum penalty of sixteen years imprisonment. The crime is having sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of ten and fourteen years.7. As Ms Roberts who appears for the prosecution pointed out, the Court of Criminal Appeal has said that the purpose of such crimes is to protect children from sexual conduct, even though they may be willing participants. After some persuasion, the complainant in this case became a willing participant. Hence, Joseph Sayhoun found himself charged with a very serious crime. He has no criminal record.8. There is a victim impact statement by the victim. She said that her life has totally changed from one world to another. She can no longer trust even people who are close to her. She started drinking and smoking as a result of her turbulent emotions. Her grades at school have dropped. She finds it hard to remain at school and finds that she has problem trusting the male teachers. The relationship within her family is strained. She feels she needs to punch things and throw things when she is angry. She feels that she has been forced to grow up prematurely and not experience her childhood. She is from a religious family and feels very ashamed at what she has done. There is a stigma attached to her because some people know about it. She has been called offensive names. It has caused a lot of heartache in her family. As she correctly pointed out, “I was just a child and he was a grown man knowing exactly what he was doing was wrong”.9. I make two observations about that victim impact statement. The first is that the victim is correct in saying that she was just a child and he was a grown man. True it is, as Ms Nash who appears for Mr Sayhoun argues, the age difference is six and a half years between thirteen and twenty. But as Ms Roberts points out and I accept, there is a large difference in maturity between a thirteen year old school girl and a twenty year old university student. For the following four and a half of those six and a half years, the complainant will still be a child, whereas the offender Mr Sayhoun had been an adult already for over two years.10. The second aspect of the victim impact statement is the description of the impact on the victim. It has been severe. This is why this sort of activity is made into a crime. I do not know how long she will experience the effects of the crime committed against her. It may be for the rest of her life, although there is no evidence to support that. Hopefully, it will be for a far lesser period. But it has obviously thrown her off course since it has occurred and has had a seriously unfavourable impact on her life.11. Mr Sayhoun is very well regarded by those who write on his behalf. He is regarded as a very good employee and was an excellent and highly regarded school student. He is well respected amongst his work colleagues. The offence was clearly out of character. Ms Nash called both her client and her client’s sister. What was immediately obvious from her client’s evidence was the remorse shown by him.12. The law about remorse has changed in recent times. It is harder for courts to accept remorse. It can only be taken into account in sentencing, nowadays, if the offender has provided evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his actions. I find it unusual that such evidence is actually presented in cases before me. This is an exception.13. Mr Sayhoun in his evidence before me genuinely accepted responsibility for what he did and is clearly well aware of the injury and damage which he has caused to his former friend. The impact includes, as he says, depression and shame and a significant loss of self confidence. His sister describes a very supportive and loving brother. He clearly comes from a strong and very highly regarded family, who have high moral and religious standards.14. Their mother died when Mr Sayhoun was only twelve years old and a lot of his upbringing was undertaken by his older sisters, including Anita Sayhoun, who gave evidence today. She spoke highly of him. His plans for the future will be supported by his family. He is in fact living with Anita Sayhoun at the moment. She trusts him completely with her children. He has just finished his university education.15. There is a pre-sentence report which has been prepared by the Probation and Parole Service. It confirms that he has accepted full responsibility for his actions and displayed insight into the injury which has occurred. It regards him as suitable for a medium to low level of intervention and supervision would include strategies to address sex offending behaviour. It would focus on referral to the Department of Corrective Services’ Forensic Psychology Services and monitor participation in sex offence specific intervention. He is suitable for a Community Service Order but the work is not available. He is ineligible for a Periodic Detention Order.16. Ms Nash in her very helpful written submissions suggests that a suspended sentence is in order. Ms Roberts in her equally helpful oral submissions agrees that such a proposal would not involve appellable error. She does however point out the objective seriousness of the crime and that it should attract a custodial sentence.17. I agree with that submission and the submission which is clearly implicit in what Ms Nash has to say: having considered all the possible alternatives I regard a sentence of imprisonment as the only one that is appropriate but I propose to suspend that sentence of imprisonment.18. Although it is a very serious crime, there was, I accept as Ms Nash argues, no level of humiliation, force or violence inflicted upon the victim. Although marginally relevant, that also includes the fact that the offence did not occur without the consent of the victim.19. The age difference, as I say, is not as significant as Ms Nash argues, in my opinion. It would be worse if the offender was older than he was but nevertheless there was a significant difference in their levels of maturity.20. I also take into account as mitigating factors, that Mr Sahyoun does not have any criminal record and that he was a person of good character. He is in my opinion unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation. As I have already said, he has given strong evidence of remorse.21. In addition to that he has pleaded guilty. He has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and I propose to extend to him the maximum benefit for that plea of guilty. I overlooked mentioning that part of the evidence tendered by Ms Nash was a report from a consultant psychologist, Mr Watson-Munro. A good summary of his views is that the prognosis is what he describes as “very positive and that it is highly improbable that this man will be seen before the court again.” He recommends professional assistance. Mr Sahyoun said that he had received more support than he expected from his consultations with Mr Watson-Munro.22. I would regard an appropriate penalty, taking into account the objective seriousness of this case, as one of three years imprisonment. Because Mr Sahyoun has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity I will reduce that by one quarter, that is by nine months to twenty seven months imprisonment. Because of the various subjective matters, which I have referred to, I regard a penalty of two years imprisonment as appropriate. Would you stand up please Mr Sahyoun.23. I sentence you to imprisonment for two years and I make an order suspending the execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole of the two years and directing that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for two years. The conditions of the good behaviour bond will be these:1 That you remain of good behaviour.2 That you notify the Registrar of this court of any change in your residential address.3 That you attend court if called upon to do so.4 That you accept supervision from the New South Wales Probation and Parole Service and accept all their reasonable recommendations and directions so far as addressing sex offending behaviour including any referral to the Corrective Services Forensic Psychology Services and participation in sex offence specific intervention programmes.5 For the purposes of arranging supervision you should report to the office of the Probation and Parole Service at Fairfield on or before 12 January 2009.HIS HONOUR: Now I am in a moment going to discharge my statutory responsibility of explaining that sentence to Mr Sahyoun but Ms Roberts and Ms Nash, are there any aspects of the sentence which I have overlooked or need to correct or add to.ROBERTS: Your Honour Ms Havryliv has just pointed out to me that she was wondering whether you needed to set a minimum period - it was my understanding that you didn’t.HIS HONOUR: No, not any more.ROBERTS: No.HIS HONOUR: Used to be.ROBERTS: Yes your Honour, I thought - you don’t set a non-parole period.HIS HONOUR: If it is breached that’s when I set it.ROBERTS: That’s when it happens, yes your Honour. That’s my understanding.HIS HONOUR: I agree. In a moment I've got to deal with this motion but we will deal with that separately so Ms Roberts, anything about the sentence?ROBERTS: No your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Ms Nash?NASH: No your Honour I just don’t know whether your Honour will be setting an expiry date after that.HIS HONOUR: I do for the bond but not for the sentence.NASH: Yes. Thank you your Honour.24. All right, Mr Sahyoun, two things are obvious about this case. One is, you have engaged in a very serious crime, very serious. You violated a thirteen year old girl when you were a twenty year old adult male. The second thing that it is obvious to me that you realise fully what you have done. That is unusual in cases such as this and it seems to me that your prospects in the future are very good. You have got very strong family support and you have got some insight into just what you have done so those two things come together for me and I have decided to accept Ms Nash’s arguments. The crime is so serious that I have imposed a sentence of imprisonment but on the other hand because of your attitude and other factors, I have suspended that sentence so you have a sentence of two years imprisonment. That sentence has been suspended on condition that you enter into a bond and that is like a promise that you make to the court. You will be taken to the registry to fill it out. There are four conditions, I think four, of that bond which you will see. One is that you are of good behaviour. That means you have got to stay out of trouble. I do not think that will be a problem for you but it is really important that you stay out of trouble. Two, if you change your residential address you have got to write a letter to the Registrar of this court and tell them. Three, if you get a notice saying you have got to come back to court, probably before me, then you have got to turn up. We do not want to be sending the police out to arrest you. The fourth is probably the most important and that is that you are going to be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service, by the people who prepared the report for you. They are going to give you advice about what will help you in dealing with what it was that brought about this offence. They are experienced in that sort of help. I think you will respond to that because you have responded to Mr Watson-Munro’s help already so I think you will find it is very helpful.25. The bond lasts two years. It will date from today and I should say that as part of my formal order, the bond will date from today and expire on 18 December 2010.26. What is the most important thing about this sentence is this. What are called good behaviour bonds are commonly understood as you breach the bond, you come back and the court says well look, you should not do it again and we will let you off again. But a good behaviour bond which is attached to a suspended sentence is quite different. If you breach a good behaviour bond attached to a suspended sentence, you come back to court and it is very hard to stay out of gaol. The law in this State is against a person who breaches a good behaviour bond when it is attached to a suspended sentence because the law says, you have been sentenced, you have got a gaol sentence but because of a special case it is suspended and if you breach that the law says it has got to be a very exceptional case that you do not go to gaol so that is why it is very important that you stay out of trouble. Do you understand that?OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Yes I expect you do and I expect that you will sort your life out from here on and by the looks of it you will have a long and productive life with a very supportive family so good luck. Is there anything else?ROBERTS: Thank you very much your Honour.NASH: Just the forfeiture order your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Yes. All right have a seat Mr Sahyoun. You are about to lose your car by the looks of it. So you are asking for an order under the Confiscation of Proceeds of Crimes Act 1989.ROBERTS: Yes your Honour. The application is made under s 13 but the order is made under 18.HIS HONOUR: Order is under 18 yes and Ms Nash is that opposed?NASH: No your Honour, it is not opposed except would your Honour allow the order not to be executed before the 22nd December which will be--HIS HONOUR: Before when?NASH: The 22nd December. We have discussed that with Ms Roberts.HIS HONOUR: So I delete ‘forthwith’.ROBERTS: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: ‘Not before 22/12/08’.NASH: At the close of business on that day.HIS HONOUR: All right I will say not before 23/12/08.NASH: Thank you your Honour.ROBERTS: So that should be - that notation or the change your Honour should be made on both the short minutes of the forfeiture order and the forfeiture order itself.NASH: That is correct.ROBERTS: And I think your Honour has a number of copies of those because you have to provide three copies to the Registrar.HIS HONOUR: I am just signing everything in sight here Ms Roberts.ROBERTS: Thank you your Honour.HIS HONOUR: I think I have got that right, all right, I have signed those, made those orders. Anything else Ms Roberts, Ms Nash?ROBERTS: No your Honour.NASH: No thank you your Honour.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: The appellant was arraigned and pleaded not guilty before his Honour Judge Geraghty and was tried before a jury of 12 on 17 October 2006 at the Sydney District Court. The indictment alleged two counts of discharging a firearm in a public place (s 93G(1)(b) of the Crimes Act 1900) and one count of receiving a motor vehicle (s 88(1)(a) of the Crimes Act). On 9 November 2006 the jury convicted the appellant of the two counts of discharging a firearm, there having been a verdict of not guilty by direction with respect to the receiving count.  
     
      
    2 On 14 December 2006 the appellant was sentenced on each count to a non-parole period of three years and three months to date from 22 June 2004 and to expire on 21 September 2007 with a balance of term of one year and one month to date from 22 September 2007 and to expire on 21 October 2008. Accordingly his sentence has fully expired. He therefore only appeals against his conviction.  
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    3 The Crown case was that the appellant was involved in a joint criminal enterprise to discharge a firearm at the house of Raymond Frangieh (Frangieh) at Merrylands on 25 September 2003. The incident was referred to at the trial as a “drive-by shooting”. It was not alleged that the appellant took part in the actual shooting but that he organised it. The Crown case was that the actual shooter was a man known by the nickname “Minnie Me” (as it appears in the transcript) and that the driver of the vehicle was Christopher Lenati (Lenati).  
     
      
    4 It was alleged that the shooting was instigated by the appellant because of a grudge against Frangieh, which stemmed from a dispute about ownership of a yellow BMW motor vehicle.  
     
      
       
      The Crown witnesses 
       
      
    5 Relevantly, the Crown called three witnesses all of whom, to a greater or lesser degree, were accomplices in the drive-by shooting. Of those witnesses, Lenati was the most critical as without his evidence there was little doubt that the Crown case would fail. Lenati had taken part in an electronically recorded interview (the ERISP) with investigating police officers in New Zealand on 22 February 2004, which was admitted as part of Exhibit E in circumstances to which I shall refer below. That exhibit relevantly comprised the videotape of the ERISP and a transcript of its contents. Lenati also took part in a drive-around interview with investigating officers on 10 September 2004 during which he showed them relevant locations. The videotape and transcript of that interview became Exhibit F.  
     
      
    6 In both interviews Lenati referred to the appellant as “Ken”. In the interview on 22 February 2004, Lenati was informed that he was going to be asked a number of questions about the drive-by shooting commencing with a meeting at the flat of the sister of the shooter, “Minnie Me”. It is convenient at this point to set out the critical questions and answers as recorded in the ERISP upon which the Crown relied to implicate the appellant in the shooting: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q21 … 
         
        A. We had a meeting at um, at the shooter’s sister’s place um, Ken Tan, Roy Malouf, Minnie Me we call him and a few other um, Lebanese fellows were there … We all had a meeting there and something had come up … I saw a, I think they’re called it a M1, and a nine mil um, as they were packing up they were planning out, when I say they were um, Ken, Roy and the shooter were planning the best routes of how to get out safely and, and um, yeah, for the getaway procedure. We then left, left the, the house. As we left we, ken would head off to the casino … 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q100 … And who was, who was in that room when you got there? 
         
        A. Roy, um, Maroun, Ken and Minnie Me, and one of Minnie Me’s um, um, mates. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q102 O.K. So who, who had the, what was the conversation, who spoke first? 
         
        A. Um, Ken spoke first. 
        
       
       
        
        Q103 And what did he say? 
         
        A. Um, something oh, Ken spoke of um, we need a driver and we need someone who’s gunna shoot, um, this was all referring to Ray Frangieh, um, apparently some fallout had happened and Ken was still pissed off at um Ray Frangieh. 
        
       
       
        
        Q104 Did, did Ken explain why he was pissed off? 
         
        A. Due to um, they were in the bedroom, but you could hear them from the living room um, as they were wiping down all the equipment. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q109 Telling --- 
         
        A. Yep, they were wiping down the um, and talking, and I can’t distinctly remember what they were saying, but um, it was to do with the BMW, it was to do with the BMW. I can’t remember what they were saying word for word, but it went something like um, like um, who does Ray think he is? Yeah, and they have, they had to do something about him. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q111 OK. And oh did Ken, you said Ken said, we need a driver, we need a shooter. Did Ken ask, ask anyone to, if they wanted to do it, or were there volunteers, what was the next part of the conversation? 
         
        A. Ken asked, Ken asked ‘em, you know. Roy jumps up and goes, yeah, I’ll do it, I’ll do it, I’ll do it, um, and um, I was sitting there, I never volunteered for nothin’, I never volunteered um, to do anything, and they said, Chris, can you get us a driver? And to feel still part, to feel still part of the team I had to, I felt like I had to go, yeah OK, I’ll get the driver. So it was my part to get the driver um, then Ken said that he’ll pay him, pay the driver. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q116 Did you see the guns while you were at Minnie Me’s house? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q117 And where were they? 
         
        A. In the bedroom with the guys. 
        
       
       
        
        Q118 Which guys? 
         
        A. With the guys, I think, earlier in the bedroom, which was Ken um, Minnie Me, Roy and Maroun. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q127 And how did you know it was an M1? 
         
        A. Oh, they kept talkin’ about it all the time. 
        
       
       
        
        Q128 Who’s they? 
         
        A. Roy, Ken um, Minnie Me and Maroun. 
        
       
       
        
        Q129 And what were they saying about it? 
         
        A. … was saying, ah, it’s ancient … but it still handles business, like, it was ancient, like, it looked ancient, and when, when Minnie-me shot it he had to click something back before letting it go, and when it got stuck he was trying to click it, he’d click it, but it wouldn’t, you know. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q139 OK. And so they’ve wiped the guns down. What happened then, what, what happened to the guns then? 
         
        A. Um, the guns then were put back into the bag um, and everything started to roll then, started motion, like, Ken said, OK, I’m gunna be at the casino so wait for this minute, right on this time, then go and do it, or whatever, like that. 
        
       
       
        
        Q140 So did, did he, can you try and remember exactly what he said, like, what time he said to wait till and all that sort of stuff? 
         
        A. Oh, he said, give it about twenty minutes, I should be in the casino by twenty minutes and um, you guys are free to go, yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q407 So when you got to Minnie Me’s house --- [after the shooting] 
         
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q468 [sic] --- what happened then? 
         
        A. We took the guns inside the house um, … 
        
       
       
        
        Q408 OK. And what did you do when youse got there? 
         
        A. Waited for Ken and they wiped down the guns. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q411 OK. And how long did you have to wait for Ken? 
         
        A. About an hour, hour and a half or so. 
        
       
       
        
        Q412 And what happened then? 
         
        A. Ken came down and gave me some money to give to who he thought had drove, so I gave him the money. 
        
       
       
        
        Q413 So what, what, what did Ken say to you, what was the conversation you had? 
         
        A. He goes, Oh good, everything went all right … everything went all right? And I go, yeah I think so. He goes, and he asked um, the gun, the shooter, was the driver good? … 
        
       
       
        
        Q414 Yeah. 
         
        A. --- yeah, and um, but he goes, all right then, good, how many … he, he asked questions. Ken asked questions like you guys, like the coppers, really, really precise about things, you know what I mean, he’s, he’s a smart guy, man. You know, where was it shot? What, you know, how many rounds did you do? How many rounds was it before it jammed? ‘Cause um, the guy who shot the thing said that it jammed, and Ken was saying, oh yeah, so how many rounds, whereabouts, what did it hit? Um … 
        
       
       
        
        Q416 And then, so, OK, so Ken gave you some money. How much money did he give you? 
         
        A. $500.” 
        
       
      
    7 At Q.469 Lenati said that he did not understand what he would get from helping the police adding, “I don’t mean that I don’t want to help”. He was then informed (at Q.471) that a court would take into account any assistance he gave the police and that without making any promises the investigators might seek total immunity with respect to his involvement in the enterprise. However he was also informed that the investigator could not personally give him any immunity but that that was something that could be looked at later on. After indicating that he was not concerned for his own safety but only for that of his fiancé, the following further questions and answers were recorded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q478 So, all right, and did he say anything, did Ken say anything else to you in that conversation? 
         
        A. He did mention that, man, do you know what he was going to the police on me, he was going to the cops on me.” 
        
       
      
    8 I mention the matters referred to in the preceding paragraph as Lenati was cross-examined by trial counsel for the appellant to suggest that he had been placed under pressure by the police interrogators to assist them and had therefore told them what they wanted to hear with respect to the appellant even though it was not true. 
     
      
    9 So far as Exhibit F was concerned, Lenati answered questions with respect to the time when he was at the home of Minnie Me’s sister which included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “V.2 [Det. Sergeant Tzinberg:] OK. And then what did you do when you were here? 
        
       
       
        
        V.3 [Lenati:] Ken was trying to organise who was going to be the driver, who was going to be the shooters and all that, for the night.” 
        
       
      
    10 The other two witnesses were “Eddy” Latu (Latu) and Tevita “Deder” Fifita (Fifita). To a lesser extent than Lenati, they also implicated the appellant in the shooting. However, as I have noted, without the evidence of Lenati, their evidence would not have been sufficient to convict the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. 
     
      
       
      The Crown application under ss 38 and 65 of the  
      Evidence Act  
      1995 
      
    11 The Crown was aware that Lenati would not be a co-operative witness because of two prior trials with respect to the subject charges that had been aborted. The trial judge was so informed, it being foreshadowed that Lenati would be called on the voir dire for the purpose of laying the ground work for an application by the Crown under s 38(1) of the Evidence Act 1995 (the Act) to cross-examine him with respect to the contents of what became Exhibits E and F.  
     
      
    12 It is convenient, therefore, to set out the provisions of s 38(1): 
     
      
       
        
        “A party who called a witness may, with the leave of the court, question a witness, as though the party were cross-examining the witness, about 
        
       
       
        
        (a) evidence given by the witness that is unfavourable to the party; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) a matter of which the witness may reasonably suppose to have knowledge and about which it appears to the court the witness is not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence; or 
        
       
       
        
        (c) whether the witness has, at any time, made a prior inconsistent statement.” 
        
       
      
    13 The expression “prior inconsistent statement” is defined in the Dictionary to the Act to mean 
     
      
       
        
        “a previous representation that is inconsistent with evidence given by the witness”. 
        
       
      
    14 Lenati was examined on the voir dire. After being informed that he was in Court to give evidence in relation to the trial of the appellant in relation to charges involving the drive-by shooting at Frangieh’s house in Merrylands on 25 September 2003 and on being reminded that he had been granted an indemnity provided that he actively co-operated in the proceedings brought against the appellant, he was then asked whether he had been in a flat (being that of the sister of Minnie Me referred to at [6] above) with, amongst others, the appellant on that date. The following exchange then relevantly took place between Lenati and the Crown Prosecutor: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Were you in a flat at any time on 25 September 2003 with any of those persons I’ve just named? 
         
        A. Not that I can remember. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Not that you can remember? 
         
        A. No. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you remember that drive-by shooting at all? 
         
        A. Well I’ve put it all, you know, I’ve tried to dig it all up, but not that clear. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. No the question is do you remember the drive-by shooting at all? 
         
        A. … No. Not to my knowledge your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Q. Do you have any recollection of a drive-by shooting on 25 September 2003 at … Merrylands? 
         
        A. Not that I can recall. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Q. Mr Lenati you have given assurances to the community that you would cooperate in giving evidence? 
         
        A. Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. In this matter and other matters. You are not making any effort whatsoever to remember any of those matters? 
         
        A. Well I have your Honour. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. I don’t believe anything you’ve said about your loss of memory? 
         
        A. Well it’s not loss of memory, it’s just that I’ve put it all, I’ve gone. You know, I’ve moved past it. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you have any recollection of telling the police anything at any time about a drive by shooting on 25 September 2003? 
         
        A. I told the police a lot of things while they were around me so that could be one of them. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Do you now not recall what you said to the police? 
         
        A. I now stand by whatever is on the statements, whatever is there I stand by it.” 
        
       
      
    15 Counsel then addressed the trial judge with respect to the Crown’s application which, upon prompting by the trial judge, was extended to include an application under s 65 of the Act to admit at least parts of what became Exhibits E and F based upon this Court’s decision in R v Suteski [2002] NSWCCA 509; (2002) 56 NSWLR 182. Relevantly s 65, which provides for an exception to the hearsay rule in criminal proceedings where the maker of a statement is not available, is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) This section applies in a criminal proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact.  
        
       
       
        
        (2) The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is given by a person who saw, heard, or otherwise perceived the representation being made, if the representation was: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) against the interests of the person who made it at the time it was made."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    16 Clause 4 of Pt 2 of the Dictionary to the Act relevantly provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) For the purposes of this Act, a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about a fact if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person is dead; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the person is, for any reason … not competent to give the evidence about the facts; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the parties seeking to prove the person is not available, to find the person or to secure his or her attendance, but without success; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) all reasonable steps have been taken, by the parties seeking to prove the person is not available, to compel the person to give the evidence, but without success.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    17 The application by the Crown on both grounds was hotly contested by trial counsel for the appellant who also submitted that even if the requirements of ss 38(1) and/or s 65(1) were satisfied, his Honour should nonetheless exclude the evidence pursuant to either his discretion under s 135 on the basis that it would be unfairly prejudicial to the appellant, or to s 137 upon the ground that its probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. Reliance was also placed on s 192 which empowers the court when giving leave (including leave to cross-examine pursuant to s 38) to impose such terms on that leave as it thinks fit. 
     
      
    18 At the conclusion of argument, his Honour gave the following short judgment: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the substance of the evidence is extremely probative and that the obvious unfairness of the situation can, to a very large extent, be cured principally by directions from me I understand but also by the sensitive and delicate way the Crown proposes to present the evidence and for that reason I have come to the conclusion, and for reasons that I’ll give in due course, that the sections 65(2) apply but only to statements against interest and that in respect of those statement[s] that don’t apply to that, then section 38 will apply. So that I propose to grant leave to the Crown to cross-examine on those matters that do not relate to statements, representations against interest and for those statements that do relate to representations against interest section 65(2) will apply …” 
        
       
      
    19 The trial judge then foreshadowed that he would give more detailed reasons in due course, which he in fact did on 27 October 2006 after the conclusion of Lenati’s evidence before the jury.  
     
      
    20 The appellant does not challenge the grant of leave by the trial judge to the Crown to cross-examine Lenati pursuant to ss 38(1) and (2) of the Act. His Honour concluded that Lenati fell within each of the sub-paragraphs of s 38(1), which I have set out at [12] above. He also rejected the appellant’s attempts to resist the grant of leave to cross-examine Lenati on his ERISP founded on ss 135, 137 and 192 of the Act. No challenge is made with respect to his Honour’s findings in relation to his rejection of the appellant’s reliance upon those provisions.  
     
      
    21 However, it is important to note that with respect to his Honour’s consideration of ss 135 and 137, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… In general one could say that unfair prejudice arises from the use by a jury of evidence in some unacceptable manner. There is, of course, serious prejudice to both parties in granting leave pursuant to s 38 to cross-examine Lenati on his statements and interviews. But this prejudice is not unfair per se. It tends to establish and strengthen the Crown case. However, there is also a level of unfair prejudice in refusing to exclude Chris Lenati’s evidence, or in granting leave pursuant to s 38. Much of the evidence is not in the proper form. The accused will probably be unable to test effectively Lenati’s evidence in cross-examination. Detective Flood is not available for cross-examination as to the circumstances in which the statements and the ERISP were created, though Levy was also present and is available for cross-examination. The presence of Levy weakens the area of unfairness but of course does not remove it. Furthermore, this is evidence of an accomplice which may be given more weight by the jury than it deserves. However, on the other hand, Lenati’s evidence is of considerable value; it is central to the issues; it is corroborated by Fifita and Eddy Latu; it is detailed and clear. It was recorded four and a half months after these dramatic events. 
        
       
       
        
        In these special circumstances, any decision is a delicate exercise. In my estimation, the probative value of Lenati’s evidence outweighs the real danger of unfair prejudice which I consider can be cured by judicial directions. 
        
       
       
        
        I propose to grant leave, pursuant to s 38, for the Crown to cross-examine Lenati on his statements and interviews, subject to any dispute as to individual passages or specified questions and answers.” 
        
       
      
    22 The trial judge then turned to the Crown’s application under s 65 noting the appellant’s submission that the Crown had asserted two contradictory or inconsistent propositions, namely, that on the one hand Lenati was available to give evidence and could be cross-examined by the Crown pursuant to s 38; but on the other that Lenati was unavailable and therefore the provisions of s 65 were engaged. The trial judge then continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “I pause to observe that a witness may be physically available and present in the witness box but legally unavailable pursuant to clause 4(a) of the Dictionary in the  
        Evidence Act 
        . I refer to the decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal in  
        The Queen v Suteski 
        .  
        
       
       
        
        Tan does not concede that Lenati is unavailable as defined in clause 4(1)(f) of the Dictionary and therefore the Crown must rely, according to Tan’s submission, only on s 38, and not on s 65. It was submitted on his behalf that in  
        Suteski  
        the witness did not give evidence, that he refused to answer questions, whereas in this case, Lenati has been in the witness box on the voir dire, he has given some evidence, he has stated that he does not remember. He has also asserted that he stands by the statements he made to the police and consequently, it was submitted, the Crown has succeeded in Lenati giving evidence, and that he will continue to give evidence, albeit, perhaps unsatisfactorily. 
        
       
       
        
        I pause to observe that Lenati cannot now know that what he said to the police in February 2004, for example, is the truth, since he does not now remember anything of those events. He cannot say that the statements he made to the police were true, and at the same time not remember anything about which he gives evidence. He has effectively refused to give evidence, just like the witness in  
        Suteski 
        , and I have concluded that, like  
        Suteski 
        , he is unavailable.” 
        
       
      
    23 Later in his judgment, his Honour returned to the question of Lenati’s availability, observing that under questioning on the voir dire he had asserted total failure to remember. His Honour considered it inconceivable that having been confronted with the fact that he had been granted immunity and diminished sentences provided he gave evidence in accordance with his prior statements to the police, he should now assert a complete loss of memory of the events in question including his central participation in them. His Honour observed that it offended common sense that Lenati could provide the detailed statements he did and then suffer complete amnesia. In these circumstances, he found that all reasonable steps had been taken to compel Lenati to give evidence without success. His Honour therefore confirmed his earlier finding that Lenati was unavailable in a manner analogous to the witness in Suteski. 
     
      
    24 The trial judge then turned to whether the Crown had established that the representations of Lenati upon which it wished to rely were against Lenati’s interests at the time they were made within the meaning of s 65(2)(d) of the Act. He concluded that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… many of Lenati’s representations to the police on the subject of these incidents were, when he made them, against his interests, against his reputation and exposing him to a claim for damages, for the damage caused in the drive-by shooting or for his involvement in the firing of [sic] the car.” 
        
       
      
    25 His Honour then turned to the provisions of ss 135, 137 and 192 of the Act. As to ss 136 and 137, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… As I have observed there is some danger that the evidence of Lenati might be used in some unacceptable manner by the jury: for example, by giving it weight it cannot bear, for example because Lenati has not been confronted by and exposed to cross-examination. However, his evidence, even in the form it is proposed to be presented to the jury, is very weighty and of considerable probative value. The extent to which his evidence could rationally affect the jury’s assessment of the probability of the existence of all the facts in issue, is both considerable and substantial, in my opinion. I consider that the probative value of his evidence is not substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might be unfairly prejudicial to the accused, or by any danger that the evidence might be misleading or confusing. Furthermore, I consider that the probative value of his evidence is not outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the accused. Any unfair prejudice can be cured by specific judicial directions. The Court must have confidence in a jury’s commonsense, in its robust, shared wisdom and its willingness to follow directions.” 
        
       
       
      Lenati’s evidence before the jury 
       
      
    26 After some short evidence in chief elicited by the Crown Prosecutor, a formal application was made for leave to cross-examine the witness with respect to contents of the ERISP of 22 February 2004. That application was granted and the Crown Prosecutor then cross-examined Lenati. Notwithstanding his stated inability to remember the matters that were put to him, he nevertheless asserted that he was attempting to tell the jury the truth. Thus, when asked whether he participated on 25 September 2003 in a drive-by shooting at the relevant address in Merrylands, he responded “Not that I can recall”. When it was suggested to him that he did recall what happened but was just not prepared to give evidence about it, Lenati responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “I say I’m prepared to give evidence on the statements I have made.” 
        
       
      
    27 The Crown Prosecutor then made an application to the trial judge to present evidence of prior statements by Lenati in relation to the shooting, to which his Honour responded that he had already made a decision to grant leave “whether it be under s 38 or s 65”.  
     
      
    28 After some further questioning by the Crown Prosecutor, the Crown then tendered the videotape of the ERISP of 22 February 2004, which his Honour admitted as Exhibit E1. In so doing he advised and directed the jury that the relevant evidence was the tape and not the edited transcript thereof that was provided to the jury as an aide memoire. His Honour also informed the jury that they would have a machine in the jury room where they would be able to play the tape and “watch it again”. The Crown Prosecutor then read from the transcript of the tape after which the videotape was played in the presence of the witness and the jury. A short time later the videotape and transcript of the drive around interview of 10 September 2004 were tendered and admitted as Exhibit F and the tape was then played in the presence of the witness and the jury.  
     
      
    29 The following exchange then took place: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. I’m asking you whether you had a good recollection – obviously having viewed the first interview with police in New Zealand, you had a very good recollection of that drive by shooting when you were talking to police in February 2004 didn’t you? 
         
        A. Yeah I guess. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The point is that you haven’t forgotten the incident now have you? 
         
        A. When watching that, what comes to my mind is just different things like. I guess it’s like I remember different things right now by watching that piece of video.” 
        
       
      
    30 When asked whether he was prepared to tell the jury who else was involved in the drive-by shooting, Lenati responded in part: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I’m prepared to tell the jury like what my – like how I came to be this way and I think at the present time I feel like – like watching that, that footage there, I see a guy that’s surrounded by police, constantly – I see a guy that’s trying to please the police. I see myself there as a guy always on cocaine. And what flash – what flashes back to my memory is, is Papa Smurf. It’s like [it] just never happened, it’s like a movie for me you know like – the interview in New Zealand was – I couldn’t even remember drawing things and just seeing myself again there. It’s like, I don’t know, inside me my whole – my whole system like shuts down. …” 
        
       
      
    31 A little later the following further exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. ---are you prepared to tell the jury who else was involved with you in the commission of the drive-by shooting on 25 September 2003. Yes or no would do? 
         
        A. And this is what I tell you Mr Crown. I’m prepared to stand by that but when I search my memory and stuff, it’s not trying to be evasive, it’s not trying to be anything else, it’s trying to like you know, when you say am I prepared to do this, man I’m prepared to do whatever – whatever I can do you know. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Can we just be clear about this. Do you say that you have no recollection now independent of what you see, on those two videos of this drive-by shooting or do you recall what happened? 
         
        A. No I don’t recall what happened like from present memory but watching that it triggers off different memories.” 
        
       
      
    32 When asked whether any police officer had told him to lie before, during or after either of the two videos, he responded “Not that I can recall”.  
     
      
    33 Lenati was then cross-examined at some length by trial counsel for the appellant. In fact that cross-examination extended over some 80 pages of transcript. The reading of it bears out the remarks of his Honour during the course of that cross-examination to the effect that he was amazed that the appellant’s counsel had been able to rekindle so much of the witness’s memory. There was also little doubt that he responded to the cross-examiner’s questions in a manner favourable to the appellant. This is exemplified by the following exchange: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You said when the police spoke to you on 22 February that Ken Tan was at the sister’s shooter’s house at Hulme Highway. I’ve read to you parts of the transcript in which you say that. Is part at least of the reason why you got the people – the names of the people who were at that meeting in part, because you knew that it would help you to add Ken Tan’s name to the list? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Ken Tan wasn’t at that meeting was he, at Hulme Highway, Enfield, that’s right isn’t it? 
         
        A. Not that I can recall.” 
        
       
      
    34 Again, the following exchange exemplifies the same point: 
     
      
       
        
        “PATCH: Exhibit F, thank you. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You say – there’s a question, “So who actually asked you to do the shooting?” Answer, “Ken, but he asked me to organise the driver”. You see that? 
         
        A. Yep. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And Ken Tan didn’t ask you to organise a driver did he? 
         
        A. Not that I can recall. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Ken Tan didn’t ask you to organise anything at all that night did he? 
         
        A. Just what I said here on the paper. 
         
         
        Q. I’m asking you a blunt question, can you give me an answer, Ken Tan didn’t ask you to organise anything that night did he Mr Lenati? 
         
        A. Not that I can recall.” 
        
       
      
    35 The thrust of the cross-examination of the appellant’s trial counsel was that he had implicated the appellant in his interviews with the police investigators either to curry favour with them or because he was pressured to do so by them. Thus, on being referred to his answer to Q.199 of Exhibit E, the following exchange occurred: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. ‘Q. So who pushed it out? A. All of us, we got everyone that was there, Maroun, myself, my cousin and Minime’. See that? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. The list of ‘all of us’ in that answer doesn’t include Ken Tan or Ken, does it? Do you agree with that? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And the reason that when you said ‘all of us, we got everyone that was there’ but did not state Ken Tan’s name is because there, when you left Ken Tan out, you were telling the accurate truth, weren’t you? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. You forgot that the police wanted you to put Ken Tan in the frame when you answered that question, didn’t you? 
         
        A. Can’t recall.” 
        
       
      
    36 And again: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. You knew that it was in your interests to answer all of the questions that the police put to you, that’s right isn’t it? 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And so you did do that, didn’t you. 
         
        A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And you did it regardless of whether the answers were true or not, didn’t you? 
         
        A. I don’t know.” 
        
       
      
    37 In re-examination the witness acknowledged that the appellant’s trial counsel had suggested to him on more than one occasion that he had lied to the police when nominating the appellant as one of the participants in the subject offences in order to do what the police wanted, i.e. to lie for them.  
     
      
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
      
    38 Five grounds of appeal were argued. They were as follows: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The trial judge erred by admitting into evidence Exhibits E and F. 
       
       
      Ground 2: Exhibits E and F contained admissions by the appellant which were admitted into evidence contrary to the decision of the High Court in  
      Lee v The Queen  
      (1998) 195 CLR 594. 
       
       
      Ground 3: His Honour erred in allowing Exhibits E and F to be taken into the jury room where they could be played by the jury without supervision. 
       
       
      Ground 4: His Honour failed to properly direct the jury as to the use they could make of Exhibits E and F, being the out of court statements of Lenati. 
       
       
      Ground 5: The verdict of the jury was unreasonable and could not be supported by the admissible evidence. 
       
       
      Ground 1: The trial judge erred by admitting into evidence Exhibits E and F 
       
      
    39 The appellant submitted that his Honour was in error in admitting Exhibits E and F to the extent to which their admission was based upon his finding that Lenati was not available to give evidence within the meaning of s 65(1) of the Act. In particular, it was submitted that Lenati was not unavailable within the meaning of cl 4(1)(f) of Pt 2 of the Dictionary to the Act in that that provision had no application to the present case where the witness had entered the witness box and responded to the Crown’s questions by asserting that he had no recollection of what was being put to him. His Honour considered that the witness’s assertion that he had a complete loss of memory of the events in question, including his participation in them, was “inconceivable”. In other words, he did not consider that the witness was telling the truth when he asserted his amnesia. However, failing to tell the truth in the witness box did not, it was submitted, constitute relevant unavailability for the purpose of s 65(1). 
     
      
    40 Nevertheless the trial judge considered that the appellant had effectively refused to give evidence, as had the witness in Suteski, and that accordingly, as in that case, he was relevantly not available to give evidence about the facts relating to the drive-by shooting. However Suteski was a case where the relevant witness simply refused to give any evidence at all. The witness was in prison at the time of the trial, serving the sentence which had been imposed on him for his part in the attack on the victim, the subject of the charge of which Suteski was found guilty. He had refused to give evidence at the committal hearing and adopted the same position at trial notwithstanding the caution given to him that he risked punishment for contempt of court. The witness made it clear during a voir dire enquiry, and also in the presence of the jury, that he would not give any evidence beyond stating his name.  
     
      
    41 In the foregoing circumstances of Suteski this Court upheld the trial judge’s finding that the witness relevantly fell within cl 4(1)(f) as a person in respect of whom all reasonable steps had been taken to compel him to give the relevant evidence, but without success.  
     
      
    42 Returning to the present case, in the course of argument two further authorities were referred to. The first was the decision of this Court in Brown & Ors v R [2006] NSWCCA 69 where the Crown relied on cl 4(1)(b) of Pt 2 of the Dictionary in support of an application under s 65. In that case the relevant witness suffered from significant brain damage and, due to his level of cognitive impairment, was found by the trial judge to be not competent to give evidence within the meaning of s 13 of the Act. 
     
      
    43 On appeal there was a challenge to her Honour’s finding under s 13 that the witness lacked competency within the meaning of that provision. It was pointed out (at [24]) that s 13 spoke of incapacity of understanding an obligation to tell the truth, incapacity to give a rational reply and incapacity of hearing, understanding or communicating, concepts which are radically different from those involving simply an absence of, or imperfection in, knowledge or recollection of events. 
     
      
    44 As this Court found (at [25]) that the witness’s evidence did not reveal any incapacity to understand the questions he was asked or to communicate answers to them so that the lack of competency or capacity tests referred to in s 13 were not satisfied, it followed that the foundation of the trial judge’s decision to admit the impugned evidence upon the basis that the witness was not available to give evidence about the relevant asserted fact was incorrect. As the present case does not involve any lack of competency on the part of Lenati, I therefore find no assistance in Brown as to the proper construction of cl 4(1)(f).  
     
      
    45 Reference was also made to the decision of Simpson J in Cox v State of New South Wales [2007] NSWSC 471; (2007) Aust Torts Reports 81-888. This was a case where the plaintiff claimed damages for personal injuries as a consequence of a breach of the duty of care owed to him by agents of the State. He alleged that as a consequence of that breach he suffered, and continued to suffer, severe emotional, psychological and psychiatric injuries.  
     
      
    46 The plaintiff’s mother gave the principal evidence in relation to the events constituting the foundation of his claim as the plaintiff himself, due to his injuries, had no recollection of the events in question. The plaintiff’s mother was not a witness to the relevant events and her evidence was informed by what had been told to her by the plaintiff from time to time. It was therefore hearsay evidence and prohibited by s 59 of the Act unless subject to one of the exceptions to the hearsay rule.  
     
      
    47 Reliance was placed upon the exceptions referred to in ss 63 and 64 of the Act, which are in the same terms as s 65(1) but apply to civil proceedings, whereas s 65 applies to criminal proceedings. Those sections call up the provisions of cl 4(1) of Pt 2 of the Dictionary as to the circumstances when a person is taken not to be available to give evidence about an asserted fact.  
     
      
    48 However, as in Brown, reliance was placed in Cox upon the provisions of cl 4(1)(b) which related to the competency of the relevant person to give evidence about the asserted fact. The plaintiff, when asked about the events the subject of his claim, responded that he had no recollection. The defendant, who resisted the admissibility of the evidence of the plaintiff’s mother, argued that this was a rational reply and that it could not therefore be concluded that the plaintiff was not available to give evidence. 
     
      
    49 Simpson J ruled to the contrary. In her reserved judgment on the plaintiff’s claim she dealt with the present issue in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “16 I concluded that this approach was erroneous. The ‘rational replies’ that the plaintiff was able to give were not replies to questions about facts relevant to his claim, but were about facts relevant to his recollection. Once he replied that he had no recollection of the events, it had to be concluded that he was not capable of giving a rational reply to questions about those facts. That he was capable to giving rational replies to questions about his recollection is beside the point; the argument focussed upon the wrong fact. It is to be remembered that s63 applies where a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about  
        an asserted fact 
        . The ‘ 
        asserted facts 
        ’ are the assertions about what was done to him by TH. He was not able to give rational replies to questions about those asserted facts.” 
        
       
      
    50 I do not regard either of the decisions referred to as being of direct assistance in resolving the issue in the present case which relates to the circumstances in which cl 4(1)(f) of Pt 2 of the Dictionary may be engaged. However, what they do illustrate is first, that lack of competency in the sense referred to in s 13 of the Act falls within cl 4(1)(b) rather than cl 4(1)(f) to the point of mutual exclusivity and, second, the fact that a witness is incapable of giving a rational reply to questions about an asserted fact is to be dealt with under cl 4(1)(b) and not cl 4(1)(f). 
     
      
    51 The distinction to be drawn between the present case and those referred to is whether a relevant witness has a genuine inability to recollect the asserted facts and is unable to give rational replies to questions about those facts. That is to be contrasted with a witness who simply refuses to answer questions about asserted facts, not because he or she does not recollect them but because he or she simply does not wish to respond to the questions asked. In the present case Lenati had asserted in his voir dire evidence to which I have referred at [14] above, that he had no recollection of the drive-by shooting not so much because he suffered from loss of memory but because he had “moved past it”.  
     
      
    52 As I have indicated, the trial judge considered Lenati’s complete loss of memory to be “inconceivable”. I take that to be a finding that he did not accept his evidence that he in fact had no memory of the events in question but that his stance was one whereby, rather than standing mute when asked questions, he intended to respond to them by relying on his alleged loss of memory. As such, as I understand his Honour’s reasoning, he was in no different position to the witness in Suteski who made it clear that he was not prepared to answer any questions with respect to the events in question.  
     
      
    53 Lenati was a witness who did not fall within cl 4(1)(e) as he did attend to give evidence at the trial. However, despite his attendance in circumstances where he was prepared to enter the witness box and answer questions, nevertheless he exhibited an intention to answer those questions by claiming that he was unable to remember anything. In other words, in the trial judge’s perception he was prepared to lie. 
     
      
    54 The critical question is whether in the foregoing circumstances, all reasonable steps had been taken to compel Lenati to give the evidence but without success. The appellant submitted at trial that the mere fact that a witness did not come up to proof or responded to questions, albeit untruthfully, by claiming lack of recollection, was a situation which engaged s 38 of the Act rather than s 65.  
     
      
    55 In the present case there could be no doubt, and it was not contested on appeal, that s 38 was engaged at least upon the ground that Lenati was a witness who was not, in examination in chief, making a genuine attempt to give evidence by way of a truthful response to the questions he was asked. It was submitted by the appellant that in those circumstances ss 38 and 65 were mutually exclusive. In my opinion, this submission should be accepted. 
     
      
    56 The question of construction of cl 4(1)(f) in the present factual context is a matter of some difficulty. To a point, common sense would seem to indicate that a person in the witness box who responds to questions in an untruthful manner by claiming lack of recollection would, prima facie, be a witness in respect of whom all reasonable steps had been taken to compel him to give evidence but without success. However, having considered cl 4(1)(f) in the context of the other subparagraphs of cl 4(1), as well as s 38, I have concluded that that provision was not engaged in the present circumstances.  
     
      
    57 Had Lenati entered the witness box but refused to answer any questions at all upon pain of being held in contempt, then clearly reasonable steps would have been taken to compel him to give evidence but without success. It seems to me that that is the type of situation to which cl 4(1)(f) is directed: see Suteski. But in my view it is not directed to a situation such as the present where a person enters the witness box, is prepared to respond to questions but does so in an allegedly untruthful manner by claiming lack of recollection or loss of memory (not due to s 13 incompetency). Those circumstances more aptly fall within s 38(1)(b) as clearly Lenati was a witness who was reasonably supposed to have knowledge of the drive-by shooting but did not, in examination in chief, make a genuine attempt to respond to the questions asked of him. 
     
      
    58 I find support for this proposition in the observation of Wood CJ at CL in Suteski (at 197 [101]) that s 65(2) assumes that the maker of the representations is not available for cross-examination. Such would be the case where that person refuses to enter the witness box as in Suteski. It would not be so in a case such as the present where Lenati was available for cross-examination by not only the defence but also the Crown pursuant to leave granted under s 38(1) and was so cross-examined. 
     
      
    59 Two further points need to be made. First, the only previous out of court representations relevantly rendered admissible under s 65(2) in the present case were those which were against Lenati’s interests: s 65(2)(c). Further, insofar as Lenati’s ERISP included representations other than those against his interests (such as those implicating the appellant), his Honour determined that s 38 would apply thereto so that leave would be granted to the Crown to cross-examine upon them. 
     
      
    60 Second, s 65, where applicable, does not mandate the admission of the previous out of court representations to which reference is made in s 65(2). It merely provides that they are exempted from the hearsay rule. The representations thus assume the same status as any other relevant evidence in that, although admissible, their admission is subject to the exclusionary provisions of ss 135 and 137. 
     
      
    61 Having made these comments, nonetheless the trial judge erred insofar as he determined that Lenati’s previous out of court representations against his interests were admissible under s 65(2)(d) as he was not a person who was not available to give evidence about an asserted fact within the meaning of s 65(1). 
     
      
       
      The Crown’s alternative argument to support the admission of Exhibits E and F 
       
      
    62 Nevertheless, the Crown submitted that even if the trial judge was in error in admitting Exhibits E and F pursuant to s 65 of the Act, he was still entitled to admit them without resorting to that provision. Reliance was placed upon the decision of the High Court in Adam v The Queen [2001] HCA 57; (2001) 207 CLR 96. In that case the prosecution in a murder trial was granted leave to cross-examine its own witness about prior inconsistent statements made to the police. The statements were admitted as evidence of the truth of what was said in them. It was held by Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Kirby and Hayne JJ that the trial judge’s discretion in granting leave to cross-examine had not miscarried and that the evidence of the witness’s previous statements could be led as evidence of the truth of their contents on the grounds that first, the evidence was relevant to matters in addition to the credibility of the witness and therefore fell outside s 102; and second, having been admitted for purposes which included an attack on the credibility of the witness, the evidence fell within the exception to the hearsay rule provided by s 60. 
     
      
    63 Sections 60 and 102 of the Act are in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “60. The hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation that is admitted because it is relevant for a purpose other than proof of the fact intended to be asserted by the representation. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        102. Evidence that is relevant only to a witnesses credibility is not admissible.” 
        
       
      
    64 Under the heading “Propriety of reception of a prior inconsistent statement”, the plurality in Adam observed (at 104 [19]): 
     
      
       
        
        “What is important, however, is that, under the Act, evidence of a witness's prior inconsistent statements will be admitted as evidence of the truth of what was said in them if the evidence is relevant for another purpose (that is, for a purpose other than proof of the truth of what was said in them [see s 60]. If admitted as evidence of the truth of its contents in this way, there would be no tender of a statement ‘inadmissible to prove facts against the accused’ and there would, therefore, be nothing improper in adopting the course proposed. This may be contrasted with the common law position where a prior inconsistent statement is not evidence of the truth of its contents, only evidence that the witness may not be telling the truth. …” 
        
       
      
    65 Under the heading “Credibility rule”, their Honours observed (at 107 [31]) that the principal thrust of the appellant’s argument was that the credibility rule (s 102) applied to exclude the evidence of the prior inconsistent statements to the police and that the exception to that rule in s 103 did not apply. This submission and those that complemented it, were rejected (at 108) in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        “33. … They focus on the use that is to be made of the evidence. The relevant provisions of the Act direct attention, in the case of the credibility rule in s 102, to how the evidence is relevant and in the case of the exception in s 103 to the credibility rule, to whether the evidence has ""substantial probative value"". Section 102 deals with evidence ""that is relevant only to a witness's credibility"". Section 103 provides that that rule does not apply to evidence adduced in cross-examination if the evidence ""has substantial probative value"".  
         
         
        34. The appellant submitted that s 102 should not be read literally. That is, the appellant submitted that s 102 should not be understood as dealing only with evidence the sole relevance of which is its bearing upon the credibility of a witness. Rather, so it was submitted, it should be read as applying to evidence which is not admissible on any basis other than the credibility of a witness.  
         
         
        35. These contentions should be rejected. The criterion of operation of s 102 is the relevance of the evidence, not any question of its admissibility. The appellant's contention, that evidence not admissible on any basis other than credibility is excluded by the credibility rule, can be seen to amount to a proposition that evidence which is not admissible, is not admissible. … Rather than adopt this rewritten version of the statutory rule, effect should be given to s 102 according to its terms. Thus attention must be directed to how the evidence in question is relevant. Is it relevant only to a witness's credibility?” 
        
       
      
    66 In Adam the appellant had submitted that reading s 102 according to its terms would produce a bizarre result. Their Honours also rejected this contention in the following terms (at 108-109): 
     
      
       
        
        “36. … The example given by the appellant in aid of this contention was of a witness's prior inconsistent statements, relevant as bearing upon facts in issue in the proceeding other than the credibility of the witness, which would be inadmissible as evidence of the truth of its contents by operation of s 59, as hearsay. This, so the argument proceeded, would not be caught by s 102 and would, therefore, be admitted as evidence of the truth of its contents by s 60. That is, not being evidence relevant only to the witness's credibility, s 102 would have no operation. Because, however, the evidence would be relevant both for the purpose of considering the witness's credibility and proof of the facts which the witness had intended to assert in the out of court statements, the hearsay rule would not apply (s 60).” 
        
       
      
    67 Their Honours then noted (at 109 [37]) that the operation of the Act and the example given was correctly stated and although it differed from what would result at common law, that difference was brought about by s 60 which was one of the significant alterations in the rules of evidence that the Act was intended to effect. 
     
      
    68 Their Honours then concluded (at 109 [38]) that once it was decided that the prosecution could cross-examine the witness about his prior statements, the evidence of those statements was admissible as evidence of the truth of their contents. That result followed from the following steps (at 109 [39]): 
     
      
       
      (a) The evidence that the witness had given prior inconsistent statements was relevant to his credibility; 
       
       
      (b) The evidence of what he had said in those statements related not only to his credibility but also to other issues in the case; 
       
       
      (c) Because the evidence of what the witness had said in earlier statements was relevant to more than his credibility (that is, it was not relevantly  
      only  
      to his credibility) the credibility rule in s 102 was not engaged; 
       
       
      (d) The evidence being relevant for purposes which included the attack on the witnesses’ credibility, but which extended to its direct relevance to the facts in issue, it was therefore within the exception to the hearsay rule provided by s 60 and admissible as evidence of the truth of the contents of the statements. 
       
      
    69 In the present case the Crown submitted that the steps to which I have referred were all satisfied. Lenati had given prior inconsistent statements relevant to his credibility, which were also relevant to other issues in the Crown case. Because the evidence of what he had said in those statements was relevant to more than his credibility, the credibility rule in s 102 was not engaged. The evidence, being relevant for purposes which included the attack on Lenati’s credibility but which extended to its direct relevance to the facts in issue, was therefore within the exception to the hearsay rule provided by s 60 and admissible as evidence of the truth of the contents of the statements. Consequently Exhibits E and F were properly admitted. 
     
      
    70 Finally, it was submitted on the authority of Brown (at [29]) that the fact that his Honour had admitted Exhibits E and F on an incorrect basis was irrelevant if otherwise they could be properly admitted on some other basis. That basis was founded in the High Court’s decision in Adam.  
     
      
    71 The appellant responded that although Adam provided a basis upon which his Honour could have admitted Exhibits E and F, it was not inevitable that, if he had not relied upon s 65, he would have admitted those exhibits. In particular, his Honour may well have dealt with the issue of admissibility in a different manner and, significantly, may have approached the discretionary or mandatory powers of exclusion under ss 135 and 137 from a different perspective and with a different result.  
     
      
    72 It is important to note that the High Court in Adam specifically held that, given its findings with respect to the effect of s 60, it was unnecessary to consider the operation of the exception to the credibility rule provided by s 103 which provided an exception to the hearsay rule if the evidence sought to be adduced had “substantial probative value”. The appellant conceded that in light of the authority of Adam, s 103 was not directly relevant. Nonetheless, it was submitted that when the question of the reliability of the contents of Exhibits E and F was considered, the delay which had occurred between the events in question and the statements made by Lenati to the police (which was a relevant consideration under s 103(2)(b) to the question of whether the evidence had substantial probative value), was of particular relevance. Although the foregoing formed part of the appellant’s written submissions, it was not expressly elaborated upon in oral argument. 
     
      
    73 As I understand the appellant’s submissions, he sought to make two points. The first, as already noted, was that had the trial judge been requested to admit the subject statements to the police pursuant to the decision of the High Court in Adam, then he would have, or at least may have, approached his consideration of the matters referred to in ss 135 and 137 from a different perspective. The second, which I think is allied with the first, accepted the proposition that the contents of Exhibits E and F could have been cross-examined into evidence by the Crown and the videotapes could have been played to Lenati in the presence of the jury as part of the cross-examination process. However, to then admit the videotapes as exhibits was unnecessary and could only serve to prejudice the appellant by enabling the jury to replay the tapes unsupervised in the jury room and so to use them in an unfair manner in circumstances when they should have been concentrating on Lenati’s oral evidence with respect to their contents. Accordingly, there was a miscarriage of justice. 
     
      
    74 The appellant conceded in oral argument that the nub of his appeal was not that s 38 was improperly invoked or that the contents of Exhibits E and F were improperly cross-examined into evidence or that there was error in the videotapes being played to the witness in front of the jury as in fact occurred. He contended that the tender of Exhibits E and F in circumstances where the Crown had informed the jury in its final address that they could play the tapes as often as they liked in the jury room created unfair prejudice to the point where, either as an exercise of discretion under s 135 or in accordance with the mandatory provisions of s 137, the tender of Exhibits E and F should have been refused on the ground that their probative value was outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the appellant. 
     
      
    75 Although it was accepted that his Honour in his judgment of 27 October 2006 considered both provisions, it was submitted that he did so against the background of Lenati’s ERISP statements to the police being admissible pursuant to s 65. Had they only been admissible in accordance with the decision in Adam, then different considerations in terms of their exclusion under either ss 135 or 137, may well have been taken into account with a different outcome. When asked what those considerations might have been, the appellant responded in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The potential prejudice of additional weight that a video representation of the evidence would have were it to be in the jury room and played to the jury’s hearts content.” 
        
       
      
    76 In support of the foregoing the appellant referred to the decision of this Court in R v GAC (NSWCCA, 1 April 1997, unreported). In that case, the trial judge, applying the provisions of ss 38, 60 and 66 of the Act, permitted the Crown to cross-examine a witness who had made a prior statement to the police about a homicide but who had professed at trial to have no memory of the events, and then tendered in evidence that witness’s prior statement. Gleeson CJ (with whom McInerney and Sully JJ agreed) held that the trial judge did not err. In that case the trial judge had applied s 66 of the Act which provides an exception to the hearsay rule where the evidence of the previous representation is given by the person who made it or a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived it being made, provided that when the representation was made the occurrence of the asserted fact was fresh in the memory of the person who made the representation. 
     
      
    77 The Chief Justice agreed with the trial judge that by virtue of ss 60 and 65 of the Act, the contents of the witness’s earlier statements to the police were admissible in evidence subject to considerations of unfairness or unfair prejudice. For his part he did not regard the probative value of the interviews that led to the making of the statements as being outweighed by unfair prejudice to the accused.  
     
      
    78 In relation to the trial judge’s decision to admit the videotape of the interview in circumstances where a substantial part of its contents had already been put before the jury in questioning of the witness by the Crown Prosecutor, the Chief Justice observed that the trial judge 
     
      
       
        
        “had to consider an argument that it was unfair for the Crown to have the benefit of the added weight which would come from the jury having a tape, as well as the impression of the oral evidence. His Honour took this into account, but pointed out that it was desirable that the jury should have available the full context of the interview so that they could evaluate questions and arguments concerning the manner in which the interview was conducted. The conclusion that it was proper to admit the video tape has not been shown to be in error.” 
        
       
      
    79 The appellant submitted that the argument before the trial judge to which the Chief Justice referred was not one considered by the trial judge in the present case. In particular, his Honour had not considered whether it was desirable that the jury should have available the full context of the Lenati interviews so that they could evaluate questions and arguments concerning the manner in which the interview was conducted. This was an odd submission given that the cross-examination of Lenati by the appellant’s trial counsel was in part directed to that very matter. 
     
      
    80 It is true that there was no reference to any such consideration in the trial judge’s consideration of ss 136 and 137, which I have set out at [21] and [25] above. Certainly, his Honour considered the danger that the jury might use Lenati’s evidence in some unacceptable manner by giving it weight it could not bear because the witness had not been confronted by and exposed to cross-examination. This notwithstanding, his Honour considered Lenati’s evidence in the form in which it was proposed to be presented to the jury, namely, in the form of a videotape, to be very weighty and of considerable probative value. His Honour further observed that “special judicial directions” could cure any unfair prejudice. 
     
      
    81 One of the difficulties was that the trial judge admitted Exhibits E and F during the course of the Crown’s cross-examination of Lenati and before he was cross-examined on behalf of the appellant. At that point the appellant had not revealed his hand as to the line of cross-examination his counsel proposed to take. It was submitted that that line of cross-examination might have been different to that which was in fact taken had the tapes not been admitted as exhibits. 
     
      
    82 The appellant’s cross-examination of Lenati generally proceeded along two lines. The first was to cross-examine the witness to suggest to him that what he had said in the police interviews was incorrect: see for example, [33] and [34] above. The second, which was pursued with some repetition, was to suggest to him that the police had held out to him that he would profit personally from implicating the appellant, whom the police regarded as a “very bad man”. Thus, in addition to the exchanges which I have recorded at [35] and [36] above, the following evidence further exemplifies the cross-examiner’s objective: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q. So by that do you mean that the police outside of these recorded interviews let you know in one way or another that they would like you to say things about Ken Tan? 
         
        A. Well Ken Tan was mentioned always on, before they even came to New Zealand, the phones and that. 
         
         
        Q. So you knew because the police had told you that they were very interested in any information you could give them about Ken Tan is that right? 
         
        A. Yes.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
         
         
        Q. You knew before they interviewed you and spoke to you in New Zealand that the police were very interested in any information you could give them about Ken Tan? 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Did whichever police officer or officers whichever one or both of them present, whatever words they used, did they let you know that they wanted you to tell them that Ken Tan was involved in the drive by shooting? 
         
        A. They just let me know that Ken was a very bad man. 
         
         
        Q. That that was their personal opinion? 
         
        A. Yeah and a lot of other things.  
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q. And did he suggest to you in that interview that the police would be grateful if you nominated Ken Tan as being involved in the drive by shooting. I’m not saying these were his words, but he did say something that gave you that understanding? 
         
        A. To a certain extent. 
         
         
        Q. Yes, and that it would be good not only would the police be grateful, but that it would therefore be good for you if you did that? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q. And Levi says to you, that the police, whatever the words were, Levi says to you that the police would be grateful if you would nominate Ken Tan as being involved in the drive by shooting and that if you did that it would be good for you – you’ve already said that. After that happened did you then decide that you would do another interview with the police? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q. And you decided that you would do what the police wanted, namely, nominate Ken Tan as being involved in the drive by shooting, is that what happened? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q. It’s only because the police suggested it to you that when you were interviewed in Auckland you said that Ken Tan was involved in the drive by shooting, that’s right isn’t it? 
         
        A. I guess.  
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q. … Were the police – before you went into the video, did the police prepare you for what you were going to say in the video? 
         
        A. I had help from them yes. 
         
         
        Q. Okay. Did they suggest some of the things that you would say? 
         
        A. I was influenced by some of the words yes.  
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q. And the combination of all of these things, your fear of being shamed, your fear of being punished, your fear of being – well no, your fear of being punished and going to gaol for along time, your fear or your knowledge that the police suspected you of involvement in some very serious crimes and your vulnerability because of your drug situation, all of those things made you very open to suggestion by the police before you were interviewed – before the electronic interview, that’s right isn’t it? 
         
        A. Yeah.”  
        
       
      
    83 It is clear from the foregoing that it was being suggested to Lenati that in his interview on 22 February 2004, he was doing no more than the bidding of the police. It was put to him on behalf of the appellant’s co-accused that he was a “police puppet”, with which he agreed.  
     
      
    84 In his summing up the trial judge pointed out to the jury that it had been suggested by trial counsel for the appellant that the three Crown witnesses, Latu, Fifita and particularly Lenati, had been “put upon” by the police to tell lies at their interviews. 
     
      
    85 However, the appellant submitted that had the videotapes not been admitted into evidence his trial counsel might not have cross-examined Lenati in the manner and to the extent that he did. It was in fact submitted to the trial judge that part of the danger of the unfair prejudice to the appellant in admitting the videotapes was that a practical decision would need to be made as to whether to cross-examine Lenati in a manner that would open up the issue as to why he changed his evidence from what he had told the police in the interviews to his lack of recollection at trial of the events in question. It was submitted that if that line of cross-examination did not occur, there was a danger of the jury being left with no explanation of aspects of Lenati’s answers in the interviews which “would be fertile ground for speculation in the jury room” which could result in the evidence being misused by the jury. 
     
      
    86 Trial counsel acknowledged that there was a useful ground for cross-examination but was concerned that if it was pursued, the Crown would have the opportunity in re-examination to cross-examine their own witness to re-establish his credit. Hence there would be unfairness. 
     
      
    87 There is no doubt that the appellant’s trial counsel was required to make a judgment call as to whether or not to cross-examine Lenati on the contents of the videotapes. There was nothing unusual about this and the counsel concerned was an experienced member of the criminal bar. Had the videotapes not been admitted, there could be little doubt that so much of their contents as was relevant to the Crown case would have been cross-examined into the record by the Crown prosecutor pursuant to the leave granted under s 38 of the Act. The dilemma, if such it be, of the appellant’s trial counsel would therefore have existed whether or not the videotapes themselves had been admitted as exhibits. 
     
      
    88 Accordingly, I am not prepared to accept that the cross-examination of Lenati on behalf of the appellant would have been any different to that to which in fact occurred even if the videotapes themselves had not been admitted into evidence. As it happened, part of their contents had been cross-examined into the record by the Crown and the videotapes had been played to the jury in the presence of Lenati. Furthermore, given the nature and extent of that cross-examination, it seems to me that even if the videotapes had not been tendered during the course of the Crown’s cross-examination of Lenati, they would have been tendered by the Crown at the conclusion of his cross-examination by the appellant’s trial counsel and would have been properly admitted by the trial judge. 
     
      
    89 It is also important to note, as I have already observed, that the trial judge only admitted the videotapes under s 65(2) to the extent to which they contained representations by Lenati against his interests. Even if he had rejected that limited tender on the basis that s 65 was not engaged, the Crown would no doubt have tendered them, as I have said, at the conclusion of Lenati’s cross-examination. Had trial counsel for the appellant then sought to have had them excluded pursuant to ss 135 and 137, I am confident that his Honour would have taken into account the same considerations as he did when he dealt with the submission that they be excluded at the conclusion of the voir dire and with the same outcome. 
     
      
    90 The trial judge summarised, with the agreement of trial counsel for the appellant, the latter’s submissions that the videotapes be excluded pursuant to ss 135, 137 and 192 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “… Then we had a s 192, 137, 135 argument about fairness. You made about six points on fairness. The first one was that Lenati could not remember the least detail of critical events so the evidence would merely amount to general adoption on affirmation by the contents of the ERISP. They were not details that were sworn to on evidence. Your second submission was that much of the evidence in the ERISP is not in the proper form and therefore, inadmissible in that form and the usual procedure of police is to take a statement. This was not a statement, it was an ERISP and it was – that if offended the usual procedure and that was unfair because it contained a lot of inadmissible evidence. Your third submission was that the witness[‘s] failure to [re]call any of his involvement in the incidences charged would be impossible to cross-examine so you’d be unable to test his evidence. Your fourth submission was that he is not an independent uninterested witness but participated in a joint criminal enterprise. And your fifth one was that Lenati had a meeting with Detective Flood who is now not available and there was some discussion about whether there was an independent statement on 20 and 21 February. Now is there anything more you want to say about that?” 
        
       
      
    91 Trial counsel for the appellant had further addressed the exclusionary provisions. In summary he advanced the following considerations: 
     
      
       
      ■ One did not know how the jury would use the videotape of Lenati’s ERISP in the jury room; 
       
       
      ■ Although the jury will be aware of the contradictions in the interviews, he could never be cross-examined about them in a manner which would elicit meaningful or useful answers; 
       
       
      ■ Because of the unexplained absence of one of the two interviewers, Detective Flood, the jury will not know and will not have evidence as to what happened between he and Lenati prior to the interview so that one will not know what the jury will make of the absence of that evidence; 
       
       
      ■ The representations of Lenati contained in his ERISP will not be evidence on oath: 
       
       
        
         
          
          ”It will be the playing of an ERISP or the reading out of statements, so its probative value is very significantly reduced by the plain and simple fact that its not on oath”; 
          
         
        
       
       
      ■ The interviews will be presented to the jury as coherent but unsworn testimony which could be given more weight by the jury than it deserved; 
       
       
      ■ The probative value of the evidence is further reduced as Lenati was an accomplice and that the possibility of total immunity and other assistance from the authorities was held out to him. 
       
      
    92 Counsel then submitted that the probative value of the ERISP was slight but that there was a real and great danger that it might be unfairly prejudicial. He concluded his submissions in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “And I submit that the probative value of the evidence in light of the accumulation of those factors is relatively slight when compared to the danger of unfair prejudice. The danger of unfair prejudice is that the jury will reason that because this man is – they might reason. Because he’s says things to the police and they’ve been recorded and he’s sitting there apparently answering questions in a spontaneous way, that they should – that that’s the sort of evidence that should be readily believed. They might give it – the danger is that they might give it weight which it does not deserve. And that’s a recognised sub-species so to speak of unfair prejudice. So – and they might reason because he said things about Ken Tan repeatedly that he’s therefore to be believed. 
        
       
       
        
        So the danger of unfair prejudice is real and obvious when weighed against the probative value the danger of unfair prejudice outweighs its relatively slight probative value. …” 
        
       
      
    93 The relevant principles relating to the operation and application of ss 135 and 137 are well established. They were summarised in Suteski by Wood CJ at CL in the following terms (at 199):  
     
      
       
        
        “116 As is now well established, the prejudice to the defendant of which each of s 135 and s 137 speak is not the simple fact that the evidence may advance the Crown case or weaken the defence case. Rather it means damage to the defence case in some unacceptable way, for example by provoking some irrational, emotional or illogical response, or by giving the evidence more weight than it truly deserves:  
        R v Lisoff 
         [1999] NSWCCA 364; and see also  
        R v Lockyer 
         (1996) 89 A Crim R 457 at 460,  
        Papakosmas v The Queen 
         (1999) 196 CLR 297 at para 91 and  
        R v Serratore 
         (1999) 48 NSWLR 101 (at 109). Dunford J there said that evidence is of this character, where it ‘ 
        has only a slight probative value, but which carries with it a probability that it will be misused by the tribunal of fact in a way logically unconnected with the issues in the case 
        ’.  
        
       
       
        
        117 There must be more than a hypothetical risk of it being unfairly prejudicial in this way – the risk must be a real one:  
        R v GK 
         (2001) 53 NSWLR 317 at 324.” 
        
       
      
    94 In the foregoing circumstances and applying the principles referred to, I do not consider that there was any error on his Honour’s part in admitting Exhibits E and F and I consider that no miscarriage of justice has occurred as a consequence of his error in admitting part of those exhibits purportedly pursuant to s 65. They were admissible on other grounds and no relevant considerations were overlooked by his Honour when he considered the appellant’s application to exclude the evidence pursuant to ss 135 and/or 137. Given the nature of the appellant’s cross-examination intended to neutralise the contents of Exhibits E and F, it was in any event appropriate and desirable that, subject to appropriate directions (see Ground 3 below), the jury should have available to it the full context of the interviews so that, to adopt the words of the Chief Justice in GAC: 
     
      
       
        
        “they could evaluate questions and arguments concerning the manner in which the interview was conducted.” 
        
       
      
    95 For the foregoing reasons I would reject Ground 1 of the appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 2: Exhibits E and F contained admissions by the appellant which were admitted into evidence contrary to the decision of the High Court in  
      Lee v The Queen  
      (1998) 195 CLR 594 
       
      
    96 In Lee the High Court (at 604 [40]) acknowledged that although s 60 of the Act was intended to work a considerable change to the common law, it was not intended to provide a gateway for the proof of any form of hearsay, however remote. Relevantly, it was confined to first-hand hearsay being previous representations made by persons who had personal knowledge of the asserted facts. In particular, it was intended to facilitate the admission of facts that were constituted by what was asserted in an out of court statement as having been seen or heard. However, it had no application to confessions or admissions in the truth of which the maker of the representation would have had no belief and, therefore, could not have intended to assert.  
     
      
    97 Thus the Court said (at 601):  
     
      
       
        
         
        “26. Evidence that Mr Calin had seen what was recorded in his statements was relevant to the issues in the case. Mr Calin's representation out of court that he had seen these things was hearsay. Because his representation out of court (that he had seen these things) was relevant for the purpose of showing that he had made a prior statement that was inconsistent with his evidence in court, the hearsay rule did not apply and the representation was admissible to prove the existence of the fact that Mr Calin intended to assert by his earlier representation.  
         
         
        27. By contrast, Mr Calin did not, in his out of court statements, intend to assert any fact about his conversation with the appellant other than that he had said certain words and that he had heard the appellant say 
          
        the words he attributed to him.” 
        
       
      
    98 In Lee Mr Calin in his written statement had recorded a conversation he had had with the appellant, part of the which the prosecution contended amounted to an admission: 
     
      
       
        
        “… leave me alone, cause I’m running because I fired two shots … I did a job and the other guy was with me bailed out”. 
        
       
      
    99 The Court considered that that portion of Mr Calin’s statement was inadmissible because it constituted second-hand hearsay in circumstances where Mr Calin would not have had any belief as to whether what he was told by the appellant was true or not. In this context the Court had observed (at 600 [24]):  
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Calin's belief (or lack of disbelief) in what he was told was of no relevance to the issues that arose at the trial. Accepting that Mr Calin believed what the appellant had told him would not, directly or indirectly, rationally affect the assessment of the probability of the existence of the facts in issue in the proceeding. Knowing that Mr Calin had said out of court that the appellant had confessed to the crime was relevant only to the question whether he, Mr Calin, should be believed. No doubt, an assertion by the appellant that he had fired two shots, had done ‘a job’ and that the ‘other guy’ had ‘bailed out’ would be relevant to the issues at the trial. But Mr Calin's statement contained no such assertion; it contained only an assertion that the appellant had said these things.” 
        
       
      
    100 In the present case the appellant submitted that the trial judge ought to have recognised that Lenati’s representations in the ERISP of 22 February 2004 and his videoed walk-through interview of 10 September 2004 contained “admissions”. It was submitted that the statements in Q&A 103 and 478 in Exhibit E relating to motive and the statements attributed to the appellant in Exhibit E at A 21, 111, 129, 139, 413 and 414 (see [6] and [7] above), all constituted confessions or admissions which should have been excluded. The same submission was made with respect to that part of Exhibit F which I have extracted at [9] above. In my opinion the appellant’s submissions should be rejected. 
     
      
    101 The answers to the questions of which complaint is made did not amount to confessional material of the nature of that which was rejected in Lee. Lenati described in those answers what he had observed or what had been said to him by the appellant and which constituted a direct account of what he had heard and thus would have been clearly admissible had he given that evidence in the witness box. He was describing what he had personally heard out of the appellant’s mouth. It was the fact that the appellant had made those statements which constituted evidence implicating him in the subject drive-by shooting and the organisation of it. 
     
      
    102 A similar complaint had been made in Suteski at trial which was referred to by Wood CJ at CL in the following terms (at 197):  
     
      
       
        
        “103 A further submission advanced at the trial, but not at appeal, was that the tender of the ERISP would have involved second hand hearsay and would therefore have been inadmissible by reason of s 62 of the Act, which only permits first hand hearsay. This argument was rejected by his Honour upon the basis that the tender of the video in which Sakisi had described what had been said to him, or what he had seen, constituted a direct account, which would have been clearly admissible, had he been called as a witness. As such it was not second hand or remote hearsay, since he was describing events in which he had been a participant, or which he had personally witnessed.  
        
       
       
        
        104 His Honour accepted, however, that where Sakisi had repeated to the police assertions of fact by someone else, and where the only relevance of that evidence was the facts asserted, it would have been second hand hearsay. Similarly repetition by a police officer of Sakisi’s account would have been second hand hearsay.  
        
       
       
        
        105 The distinction which his Honour drew accorded with the definition of hearsay in s 59 of the Act, and was plainly correct.  
        
       
       
        
        106 By reference to this distinction, his Honour held that the disclosure to the jury of Sakisi’s account, through the tender of the video or audio tapes of the interview, did not offend the first hand hearsay rule, since the record was confined to his account of the words of the appellant, which she had addressed directly to him, and to those things which he or she had done following that request.” 
        
       
      
    103 His Honour was unable to see any error in the above process of reasoning. It is applicable to the present case with the consequence that the second ground of appeal should be rejected. 
     
      
    104 Before leaving this ground I should note the appellant’s complaint with respect to Q&A 103 and 478 of Exhibit E to the effect that they suggested that the appellant had a motive to organise the drive-by shooting of Frangieh’s house. However, it was not necessary for the Crown to establish any motive and the appellant received a favourable direction from the trial judge in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The question as to motive for the drive-by shooting … arises, and whether Ken Tan actually knew, when the meeting occurred in the evening of 25 September, whether he knew, at that time, that Ray Frangieh had made a complaint to the police. If he did not, there would have been no motive. If he did, then it still does not meant that Tan was present at the meeting, and it does not mean he was involved. But, there is some evidence as to why he might have involved himself in this, you understand.” 
        
       
      
    105 With respect to Q&A 478, his Honour instructed the jury that the answer was ambiguous, indicating that it would be dangerous for them to rely upon it. Furthermore, the only objection taken to these questions and answers was based upon s 90 of the Act and the unfairness of being unable to cross examine upon them. The trial judge ruled on this objection in his judgment of 27 October 2006 and it was not suggested on the appeal that his ruling was in error. No other objection was raised at trial to the admission of those questions and answers as a consequence whereof r 4 applies thereto.  
     
      
    106 Given the trial judge’s directions to the jury on the question of motive, no miscarriage of justice or relevant irregularity is apparent. Consequently I would refuse leave to the appellant to raise any issue with respect to the admission of those two questions. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: His Honour erred in allowing Exhibits E and F to be taken into the jury room where they could be played by the jury without supervision 
       
      
    107 To a significant degree this ground overlaps with Ground 1. 
     
      
    108 The appellant submitted that there was a real risk that the jury would give undue weight to Exhibits E and F in contrast to the other evidence. The Crown in its address to the jury informed them that they would have the exhibits in the jury room and would be able to play them as many times as they liked, although it was conceded that it was then pointed out to them that they were to approach the playing of the tapes cautiously and they were expressly warned of their “swamping effect”. 
     
      
    109 The appellant nevertheless submitted that the “swamping effect” acknowledged by the Crown was the reason why the videotapes, if admitted, should not have been allowed by the primary judge to have been taken into the jury room. Reference was made to the decision of this Court in R v NZ [2005] NSWCCA 278; (2005) 63 NSWLR 628, where videotapes of a child’s evidence in chief were taken into the jury room by the jury. In that case it was acknowledged that there would be circumstances in which it would be inappropriate to allow evidence in chief of a child in video form to be taken into the jury room because of the risk that that evidence would be given disproportionate weight. 
     
      
    110 Thus Spigelman CJ (at 632 [10]) observed (in dissent but on grounds not presently relevant) that the authorities emphasised two matters: first, repetition, in a context where other balancing evidence is not or may not be repeated at all or as often; and second, the force attending evidence in an audio-visual form being compared with the force of evidence that may only be available in documentary or transcript form.  
     
      
    111 The Chief Justice then observed (at 632): 
     
      
       
        
        “11. The principle of a fair trial requires the Court to adapt its procedures and/or to give directions to the jury wherever the circumstances of a particular trial give rise to a material risk that the jury may give disproportionate weight to the particular evidence. This is a principle of general application of which the use of videotaped evidence under special statutory provisions for the giving of such evidence is one set of circumstances in which the issue has arisen.” 
        
       
      
    112 In NZ the evidence in chief of the complainant had been given by videotape under the Evidence (Children) Act 1997. The videotapes were tendered as exhibits and taken into the jury room by the jury. This Court held that there was no basis upon which a videotape of the evidence of a witness could become an exhibit, although once the videotape was played, it became part of the court record.  
     
      
    113 The present case is different. First, the videotapes in question were not of Lenati’s evidence in chief at the trial. Rather, they were a video of his prior interviews with the police. Second, there is no absolute rule that videotapes of the nature of those presently under consideration should not be taken into the jury room provided the jury are given appropriate directions as to the use they make of them.  
     
      
    114 Although the appellant submitted that there was a risk in the present case that the opportunity to replay the videotapes in the jury room might result in undue influence or disproportionate weight being given to them over other sworn evidence, there can be no doubt that the jury were well aware of the nature of the appellant’s attack on the reliability of the contents of the videotapes, a matter that was repeatedly emphasised by the trial judge in his summing up. The jury was well aware that Lenati did not give sworn evidence in court in support of the contents of Exhibits E and F and that he had been exposed to a lengthy cross-examination on behalf of the appellant with respect to their contents. They were equally aware that the exhibits did not constitute evidence given under oath. 
     
      
    115 Furthermore, the jury did not retire to consider its verdict until 10.20am on 8 November 2006. Within a short time they sent a note to the trial judge requesting they be provided with the trial transcript. This was provided to them. Although a verdict was not formally taken until late the following day (9 November 2006) the jury had advised the trial judge at about 2.05pm that they had reached a verdict. Accordingly, the Crown submitted that the period during which the jury had access to the videotapes in the jury room was limited and, therefore, was unlikely to have had any “swamping effect” as alleged by the appellant. 
     
      
    116 Given the repeated s 165 warnings of the trial judge to the jury as to the potential unreliability of Lenati’s interview with the police the subject of Exhibits E and F, the fact that the jury was warned that the contents of those exhibits were unsworn; and given also the request by, and the provision to, the jury of the trial transcript (containing the sworn evidence of the Crown witnesses and, particularly, Lenati), I do not consider that the trial judge by permitting the jury to have access to the videotapes in the jury room brought about any imbalance or unfairness in the trial giving rise to a miscarriage of justice: cf R v RTGS [2005] NSWCCA 293 at [55]. Furthermore, experienced trial counsel for the appellant took no objection to that access, so that r 4 applies.  
     
      
    117 The discretion to allow this ground of appeal should only be granted where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings. Thus there must be a convincing reason why the matter was not raised at trial or there must be the possibility of a real injustice: R v Germakian [2007] NSWCCA 373; (2007) 70 NSWLR 467 at 472 [11]-[13]. The present complaint does not go close to satisfying these requirements. Leave under r 4 should be refused and Ground 3 of the appeal rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: His Honour failed to properly direct the jury as to the use they could make of Exhibits E and F, being the out of court statements of Mr Lenati 
       
      
    118 The appellant acknowledged that the trial judge gave extensive directions and warnings to the jury with respect to the potential unreliability of the evidence of the out of court statements of Lenati. Thus in the course of summing-up, his Honour directed the jury in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “And finally, the evidence which the Crown invites you to rely on, to a very large extent, is unsworn evidence, that is, evidence given earlier on, in statements and interviews, rather than the evidence given here in court on oath.  
        
       
       
        
        So to a large extent, you need to rely on the unsworn evidence of Lenarty and Fafeda [sic] to find that Mr Tan was present at the meetings before and after the drive-by shootings. It is different with Mr Latu because he gave sworn evidence here in Court. 
        
       
       
        
        So for those reasons, I am required to warn you that the evidence of each of those three witnesses may be regarded by you as unreliable. Therefore, you need to be cautious in determining whether to accept the evidence of either of them, or all of them, and to weigh their evidence very cautiously. Very carefully.” 
        
       
      
    119 Again, later in the summing-up, his Honour directed the jury as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “So you will need to scrutinise, very carefully, the evidence, to assess what they, each of the three witnesses, have said at various stages between February 2004 when Lenati first engaged in an interview with the police, and now, when he spoke to you, under oath, in the witness box.” 
        
       
      
    120 His Honour referred to the fact that much had been said about the police interviews and, with respect to what had been admitted, the contradictions and inconsistencies contained in them. He reminded the jury that they had had the advantage of observing Lenati in both videos in terms of what he had said, how he had said it, his interaction with the police and how the police dealt with him, the nature of the questions asked and his response to them. They had then had the advantage of seeing Lenati in the witness box. Towards the end of his summing-up he reminded the jury that Lenati may have been telling lies in both his interviews.  
     
      
    121 In his written submissions (not elaborated upon in oral argument), the appellant contended that although his trial counsel had made much in his address to the jury about the inability of the defence to properly test what had been said by Lenati in Exhibits E and F and that what he had said was not on oath, the trial judge at no stage gave any judicial support to those submissions or what flowed from the fact that the out of court statements of Lenati were in the nature of hearsay evidence. In this context reference was made to ss 165(1)(a) and (2)(a) of the Act which, in the case of hearsay evidence, obliges the trial judge, if a party so requests, to warn the jury that the evidence may be unreliable, the matters that may cause it to be unreliable and for the need for caution in determining whether to accept the evidence and the weight to be given to it. 
     
      
    122 The appellant acknowledged that his trial counsel did not specifically make a request under s 165(2) although at the end of the summing up he had submitted that his Honour had misdirected the jury when he had told them that although they had seen Lenati in the witness box remembering things, he was the same person whom they had seen in the 2004 videos also remembering things. It was submitted that his Honour’s direction constituted an acceptance of the key argument in the Crown case in that in the 2004 interviews Lenati remembered events relating to the appellant’s involvement in the drive-by shooting which he did not remember in the witness box and, as I understand the argument, in those circumstances what he had said on the earlier occasions might well be true. 
     
      
    123 It was therefore submitted that his Honour should discharge the jury – an application which he declined. However, as he reminded counsel, correctly in my view, he had informed the jury “over and over and over again” that the appellant’s case was that Lenati was telling lies at the time of the interviews. His Honour then recalled the jury and directed them in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “… Do you remember I was talking to you about sitting in the witness box and remembering, and then going into February 2004 and September 2004, and remembering the events of September 2003. The witnesses may have been remembering – but they may have been telling lies in September 2004, or telling lies in February 2004. They may not have been genuinely remembering the events of the year before when they were sitting talking to the police. That is the matter that you need to decide. 
        
       
       
        
        So when I said they are sitting there in their then state of mind, remembering what had taken place, I want you to understand that it is the case for Mr Tan that they were not remembering accurately or even truthfully what had happened but when they were making those statements they were actually, in terms of Mr Tan’s presence, telling lies on the instigation of the police.” 
        
       
      
    124 As the Crown submitted, his Honour directed the jury in no uncertain terms that Lenati’s out of court statements to the police in his ERISP might well be unreliable on a number of bases including that he was an accomplice; that he had a criminal record; had obtained sentencing discounts; had been suborned by the police and had a motive to lie. He further spent a deal of time illustrating the inconsistencies in Exhibits E and F compared to Lenati’s evidence in the witness box and he made it clear to them that what he had said in his interviews was unsworn.  
     
      
    125 In a summing up occupying approximately 62 pages of transcript, some eight pages were given over to the issue of the unreliability of the contents of Exhibit E and F and there were further additional references throughout the document. As the Crown submitted, at the end of the summing up the jury would have been left in no doubt about the potential perils of accepting Lenati’s evidence and that they should approach his statements to the police with a great detail of caution.  
     
      
    126 In the foregoing circumstances, in my opinion his Honour gave more than adequate directions to the jury as to the use they could make of the out of court statements of Lenati. This ground of appeal should therefore be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 5: The verdict of the jury was unreasonable and could not be supported by the admissible evidence 
       
      
    127 Section 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 involves acceptance of the proposition that the jury’s verdict should be set aside where it is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The appellant’s submission was that absent Exhibits E and F there was insufficient evidence to implicate the appellant in the drive-by shooting. Alternatively, as Lenati’s evidence, including what he had said in Exhibits E and F, was so demonstrably unreliable, it would be unfair and a miscarriage of justice for the jury to have relied upon the unsworn out of court statements of Lenati in those exhibits to convict the appellant. It was submitted that the only conclusion the jury could have reached was that Lenati, and for that matter the other two Crown witnesses (Latu and Fifita), had no credibility whatsoever.  
     
      
    128 The appellant nevertheless accepted that Exhibit E, if viewed in isolation, contained evidence to support each of the elements of the two counts on the indictment against the appellant. However, it was submitted that Exhibit E was required to be read subject to the strongest of cautions in relation to its provenance; its hearsay nature; the effect of Lenati’s subsequent behaviour on his credibility; his implication in the offence as an accomplice and his status as an indemnified witness who received a significant benefit on sentence because of his “assistance”. It was further submitted that Exhibit E was not only an unsworn statement but had been adopted only in part by Lenati in the witness box and in a manner that would cause considerable concern about its accuracy and reliability.  
     
      
    129 The appellant acknowledged that the trial judge in his summing up had detailed not only the internal contradictions and conflicts in what each of the three Crown witnesses (upon whom the Crown had relied to establish that the appellant was present before and after the drive-by shooting) had said, but also the contradictions and conflicts between the three of them. In these circumstances, for the jury to have convicted the appellant required them to accept the hearsay assertions of Lenati contained in Exhibits E and F and to ignore everything that he had said on oath. It would also mean giving weight to the witness Fifita’s contradictory assertions about whether the appellant, as opposed to another Asian man, was at the relevant premises when discussion took place with respect to the proposed shooting. 
     
      
    130 It was thus submitted that all three Crown witnesses were suspect and that they were indemnified co-offenders who were neither coherent, consistent and whose unreliability was demonstrable. In these circumstances, to allow a conviction based on their combined testimony would be neither reasonable nor supported by any reliable evidence. 
     
      
    131 The Crown acknowledged that there were undoubted difficulties particularly with the witnesses Lenati and Fifita in that each was unfavourable in some respects to its case. However, the problem with their evidence was comprehensively analysed and the subject of more than adequate directions by the trial judge. In particular, the various inconsistencies and reasons to suspect the reliability of their evidence were identified in detail to the jury and it was impressed upon them that they should approach the evidence of these witnesses with caution. 
     
      
    132 The legal principles relevant to this ground of appeal have been authoritatively established by the High Court in M v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 487 at 492-493; Jones v The Queen (1997) 191 CLR 439 at 450-452; and MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606 at 641-615. The relevant principle was stated in M (at 493) in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where, notwithstanding that as a matter of law there is evidence to sanction a verdict, a court of criminal appeal is asked to conclude that the verdict is unsafe or unsatisfactory, the question the court must ask itself is whether it thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty. But in answering that question the court must not disregard or discount either the consideration that the jury is the body entrusted with the primary responsibility of determining guilty or innocence, or the consideration that the jury has had the benefit of having seen and heard the witnesses. On the contrary the court must pay full regard to those considerations.” 
        
       
      
    133 After referring to the qualification which had been sought to be based on what Barwick CJ had said in Ratten v The Queen (1974) 131 CLR 510 at 516, the plurality relevantly continued (at 496): 
     
      
       
        
        “In most cases a doubt experienced by an appellate court will be a doubt which a jury ought also to have experienced. It is only where a jury’s advantage in seeing and hearing the evidence is capable of resolving a doubt experienced by a court of criminal appeal that the court may conclude that no miscarriage of justice occurred. That is to say, where the evidence lacks credibility for reasons which are not explained by the manner in which it was given, a reasonable doubt experienced by the court is a doubt which a reasonable jury ought to have experienced. If the evidence, upon the record itself, contains discrepancies, displays inadequacies, is tainted or otherwise lacks probative force in such a way as to lead the court of criminal appeal to conclude that, even making full allowance for the advantages enjoyed by the jury, there is a significant possibility that an innocent person has been convicted, then the court is bound to act and to set aside a verdict based upon that evidence. In doing so, the court is not substituting trial by a court of appeal for trial by jury, for the ultimate question must always be whether the court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty.” 
        
       
      
    134 In my opinion the critical issue for the jury in the present case was whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that Lenati was telling the truth when he implicated the appellant in his recorded interviews with the police in 2004. They had the advantage, which this Court did not, of seeing and hearing Lenati give evidence over a lengthy period in which he was cross-examined by both the Crown and the defence. What the witness said in the interviews, if accepted, clearly had probative force. The present case, in my opinion, was quintessentially one where the jury were in a position of significant advantage to determine whether Lenati was telling the truth in the interviews. 
     
      
    135 There was nothing on the face of Lenati’s answers to the questions asked of him in the interviews that were inherently improbable or lacked credibility. Of course there were a number of factors, including parts of his evidence on oath, which were capable of reflecting adversely on the credibility or reliability of those answers. The jury was more than adequately apprised of them both by the appellant’s trial counsel and by the trial judge in his summing up. 
     
      
    136 However, in my view, there can be no doubt given the considerations to which I have referred, that in approaching the evidence of Lenati with the caution directed by the trial judge, it was open to the jury to accept beyond reasonable doubt his statements in Exhibits E and F implicating the appellant in the drive-by shooting.  
     
      
    137 It was no doubt unsurprising to the jury that Lenati, particularly when cross-examined on behalf of the appellant, suddenly (as the trial judge observed) underwent an improvement in his recollection which was favourable to the appellant. That Lenati had also given evidence on oath that watching and hearing the videotapes had triggered his memory and that he was prepared to stand by what he had said in the interviews even though he had no current recollection of the events in question may well have been a matter of some significance to the jury’s assessment of him. When it was suggested to him that he did recall the drive-by shooting on 25 September 2003, he responded:  
     
      
       
        
        “I say I am prepared to give evidence on the statements that I’ve made”. 
        
       
      
    138 At the end of the day it was a matter for the jury as to whether, notwithstanding Lenati’s evidence on oath, they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was telling the truth in his videotaped interviews with the police and which became Exhibits E and F. Although it was suggested to them, based on Lenati’s evidence in cross-examination by trial counsel for the appellant, that he had told the police what he thought they wanted to hear, nonetheless it was for the jury to assess that evidence in the light of the apparent attempt by Lenati to provide evidence favourable to the appellant. It was up to the jury whether they considered that that attempt should be discounted and that the truth lay in what Lenati had told the police with respect to the appellant’s participation in the organisation of the drive-by shooting. The advantage enjoyed by the jury in these respects cannot be discounted. 
     
      
    139 In my opinion, there was admissible evidence that it was open to the jury to accept as sufficiently reliable to implicate the appellant in the offences with which he was charged beyond reasonable doubt. Accordingly, I would not regard the jury’s verdict as either unreasonable or lacking support having regard to the evidence. Ground 5 should therefore be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    140 In my opinion each of the challenges to the jury’s verdict should be rejected. I would therefore propose that the appeal by the appellant against his conviction be dismissed.

   IN THE DISTRICT COURTOF NEW SOUTH WALESBennett SC DCJ19 December 20082008/00016179 BOULGHOURGIAN, John v Ryde City CouncilJUDGMENTIntroduction1 John Boulghourgian seeks relief in the District Court after decisions adverse to him in the Local Court made in the course of his prosecution for a parking offence when a vehicle, of which he claims to have no knowledge, was detected in a position where the stopping of a motor vehicle was proscribed. He was convicted in his absence, and was denied his application for the annulment of that conviction.2 On 19 September 2008 Mr Boulghourgian filed a Notice of Appeal by way of the usual form upon the grounds that the penalty imposed was too severe, and an Application for Leave to Appeal, attaching a copy of the Notice of Appeal. Leave would be required if this could proceed as a severity appeal because more than twenty-eight days had passed since the decision of the magistrate.3 The appeal so expressed was misconceived. The remedy available to Mr Boulghourgian at this point in the proceedings is to seek leave to appeal from the decision not to grant his annulment.4 Mr Boulghourgian is unrepresented, English is not his first language, and the complexity of the legislation providing for these processes was no doubt a barrier to his understanding of how to proceed after he received notice of the outcome in the Local Court.5 I allowed Mr Boulghourgian to proceed upon the basis that his application is for leave to appeal from the decision not to grant the annulment of the conviction in the Local Court.6 It is appropriate that I rehearse the history of this matter beginning with the alleged offence upon which the proceedings were commenced. This history is drawn from the court file tendered in the hearing of the application for leave to appeal and marked Exhibit A, and the appellant’s evidence.The Alleged Offence7 It was alleged by an employee of the Ryde City Council that a Toyota Camry sedan, white in colour, and bearing registration plates WHH-854 was left parked and unattended adjacent to a ‘NO STOPPING” parking sign in Morrison Road, Putney, between Charles Street and Delange Road, between 3:08pm and 3:09pm on Saturday, 4 August 2007.8 It was alleged that the vehicle was photographed in that location. Included on the court file is a colour photograph of the vehicle against such a sign and adjacent to a waste bin bearing the word PUTNEY, but there is nothing to indicate on that document the date or the time at which the photograph was exposed.9 The Electronic Penalty Notice issued included the following in a box labelled with the word, “Notes:” 
     
      
      UNATTENDED VEHICLE – WHH 854 STOOD IN A SIGN POSTED NO STOPPING AREA DRIVER WINDOW WAS OPEN NO ONE IN VEHICLE CANCELLED REGO Issue Method: Posted, Signs: No Stopping 
      
    10 The appellant was shown the photograph of the vehicle when giving evidence. He said that he had not ever seen that vehicle and knew nothing of it.11 A Penalty Notice Summary on the court file records the date of the offence, 4 August 2007, a reminder date of 18 December 2007 which I infer is the date upon which there was a payment reminder issued, the name John Boulghourgian, and the address 14 Torrens Place, Cherrybrook 2126. The appellant said in his evidence that this was his name and address.12 A Court Attendance Notice was raised, appointing the matter to the Ryde Local Court at 9.30am on 11 April 2008. The Statement of Service endorsed on the document records that a copy of the document was posted to the appellant at his home address on 29 February 2008 at 4.30pm.13 From the file the appellant was shown a “Written Notice of Pleading” in which his name and address is recorded, and bearing signature and the date 12.3.08, with a Local Court date stamp showing that the document was received on that day. This form of document is used in the procedure pursuant to s 182 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 whereby a person accused may give notice of their intention to the defend the charge against them.14 The appellant acknowledged that he lodged that document, and that he wrote on the back of the document, 
     
      
      I don’t own the vehicle WHH 854 don’t know the vehicle at all. I was at home in Cherrybrook and collect my child from school everyday at 3.00pm. 
      
    The appellant adopted the truth and accuracy of that representation in his evidence.15 By letter of 17 April 2008 from the Local Court, Ryde the appellant was informed that the hearing of this charge was adjourned from 11 April 2008 until 12.00 midday on 20 June 2008, and that his attendance at court was required. He was informed that the matter may be determined in his absence and that he should ensure his appearance or if unable to attend, contact the court beforehand.16 The appellant said in his evidence that he failed to attend at that time because he mixed up the dates. He always had it in his mind, he said, that he was to appear on 22 June 2008, not the 20 June 2008. He said that this confusion came about because of a number of matters that have been brought against him for parking and driving offences in which this vehicle was used. He said that someone has been using his name and address falsely, and that as a result, he has been the subject of proceedings in the Local Court, Parramatta brought by the Parramatta City Council for parking offences, and the New South Wales Police or the Roads and Traffic Authority for traffic offences. In his efforts to have his name cleared, and resolve the confusion created by this fraudulent use of his identify, he failed to note accurately the date he was to appear on this occasion.17 On 20 June 2008 he was convicted in his absence, fined $250.00, and ordered to pay court costs of $70.00.18 On 22 June 2008 he looked at the letter notifying him of the hearing date and realised his error. He went to the court and asked at the counter if he could have another chance to defend the charge. He said that the staff member attending him assisted with the preparation of a document for this purpose.19 There is on file an Application to the Local Court pursuant to s 40 of the Local Courts Act 1982. Handwritten at the top of the front page are the words, 
     
      
      (Dummy file) 
      
    and at the foot of the page, 
     
      
      dummy Applic 
       
      Can’t locate Original Applic 
      
    20 The appellant acknowledged that to the best of his recollection this was the type of document that was completed. He agreed that the orders sought as expressed were correctly stated. They were, 
     
      
      1. That the following order made by the Local Court be annulled: 
       
      Parties: Police v John Boulghourgian 
       
      Date of Order: 20/6/08 
       
      Place of Order: Ryde Local Court 
       
      Type of case or offences: disobey no stopping sign 
      
    21 He also agreed that the grounds for his application in this document were as recorded by the member of staff at the court. They were, 
     
      
      1. That the order made by the court was made in my absence. 
       
      2. It is in the interests of just to annul the order having regard to the following circumstances: I have numerous matters before courts in regards to these issues and I got my dates confused. I have numerous (sic) 
      
    22 The appellant said that he signed the completed application and left it at the court, and that the staff member said, “We will let you know”.23 He was told that the application would have to be approved, but was not told and did not understand that he would be required to return to court for the determination of the application.24 The document records that the application was filed on 26 June 2008. It also records that the application would be dealt with on the 11 July 2008 at the Ryde Local Court.25 The matters pending in the Local Court at Parramatta for parking offences, brought by the Parramatta City Council, were removed to the Ryde Local Court to be dealt with on the same day with this allegation. The appellant said that he attended court as required at 9.00am on that day, and there met a solicitor appearing on behalf of Parramatta City Council. Those offences were committed using the same Toyota motor vehicle, and once again some other person is alleged to have falsely used the appellant’s identity. The appellant said that the solicitor told him that his prosecution for the Parramatta offences was being discontinued, and the court was so informed. The appellant said that he appeared before Magistrate Betts when this representation was offered.26 The appellant said that once this occurred, he was of the belief that all matters were in hand, and that he could leave. He accordingly left court and went home. The matter involving Ryde City Council was in fact not called on until later in the day, after he left, and in his absence Magistrate Betts refused his application for annulment.27 The transcript of that hearing has been obtained and included on the court file. It occupies a little more than half a page. It appears that her Honour was focused upon her concern that the Parramatta Local Court had sent matters for disposal in her court. The brevity of the record permits its reproduction here: 
     
      
      HER HONOUR: Sergeant, matter 28, it’s an application for annulment, the defendant’s not here. There’s heaps of other matters which Parramatta in their wisdom, matter’s set down for hearing on 11 August, that’s the allegation disobey no stopping sign of 4 July, for some reason Parramatta has forwarded on two separate matters of speeding of 10 July and 18 July to list on 11 August to fix a hearing date, they’re not our matters, I’m not going to deal with them, they’re Castle Hill matters, they’re going to go back to Parramatta, for Parramatta to set a hearing date. But in any event there’s no appearance for Mr Goulghourgian (sic) in relation to the disobey no stopping sign. 
      
     
     
      
      THE APPLICATION IS REFUSED. 
      
     
     
      
      I will it (sic) on 11 August for mention only, but they will be going back to Parramatta if they are going to be matters defended. If he doesn’t show up, I’ll deal with them on that day. I’m not happy with Parramatta sending matters expecting them to go in the Ryde list. 
      
    28 The transcript does not indicate the time when this took place. It is not entirely clear whether her Honour was referring to proceedings brought against another or other accused, or whether she was referring to the traffic offences brought against Mr Boulghourgian and which, according to his evidence were resolved in the Local Court in the Downing Centre at a later time. I shall shortly refer to these. It is apparent however, from what is attributed to her Honour, that these were not the proceedings brought against Mr. Boulghourgian by Parramatta City Council, which, he said in evidence, were resolved shortly after court commencing sitting on that day.29 It also appears that her Honour made an error when referring to the date of the alleged offence.30 The next notice Mr Boulghourgian received was of the fine and court costs to which he was exposed following her Honour’s decision.31 At the same time as these prosecutions, the appellant has been the subject of charges for traffic offences presented by the New South Wales Police and pending in the Local Court in the Downing Centre. He told me that those matters were listed for 15 December 2008, but the prosecution informed him that he was not required to attend, because the prosecution of those matters was being terminated.32 The implication in the evidence given by Mr Boulghourgian is that the Parramatta City Council and the New South Wales Police or Roads and Traffic Authority have accepted the fraudulent use of his identity by the owner or custodian of this Toyota Camry, and have terminated their prosecutions.33 This action has not been taken by the Ryde City Council which, for reasons that are not entirely clear to me, have failed to attend court at any time for the purposes of this appeal.34 There is one other document in the court file to which I should refer. It is a handwritten document by the appellant addressed “To Whom It May Concern”, and which speaks generally about the dilemma he has following the suspension of his licence following proceedings, without identifying the specific prosecution to which he refers. The content is consistent with what he has presented to me on the application for leave to appeal, but I am unable to determine whether he is speaking of the matter with which I am dealing, or one or other of the offences that have been discontinued by the other authorities.The Proceedings on Appeal35 On 19 September 2008 the appellant lodged a Notice of Appeal to the District Court, in respect of the decision of Magistrate Betts on 11 July 2008. The grounds specified that the appeal related to the decision as to sentence because the penalty was too severe.36 Mr Boulghourgian at this stage has no standing to bring an appeal upon the grounds that the penalty imposed was too severe. However, as I noted in the introduction to these remarks, there was also filed an Application for Leave to Appeal, in which grounds are specified that are not entirely clear, but which refer to the right of appeal from the decision not to grant the annulment. It appears that there was some blending of purposes, and in the circumstances I allowed Mr Boulghourgian to proceed with an application for leave to appeal from the decision not to grant the annulment. Leave was required because more than twenty eight days had elapsed from the decisions made, and the filing of his notice and application for leave in this court.37 The Notice of Appeal specified Monday 13 October 2008 as the listing date.38 The Application for Leave to Appeal includes grounds in the following terms, 
     
      
      The grounds upon which I rely are as follows: 
       
      When the annulment was not granted by Ryde Local Court. (sic) I was not aware that the fine was still pending, and that I had a right of appeal against the Magistrate’s decision not grant my annulment. (sic) 
       
      This being my first time in Court I am not familiar with the system. 
      
    39 There was no evidence from the appellant regarding this document, and I am unable to say who assisted him with it, or the extent to which he was given assistance, however I infer from the content and structure of this passage that the representations are those of the appellant, rather than a person with any measure of legal training. Although it is not necessary to decide, it is probable that the actual preparation of the document was by another person upon what was said to them by the appellant, and from the form of the document it is probable that the person who assisted him so attended him at the counter of the court.40 According to the District Court file, the matter was mentioned on that day before his Honour Acting Judge Armitage. The appellant represented himself, and a solicitor represented the Ryde City Council.41 This was not a matter taken over by the Director of Public Prosecutions as with prosecutions brought in the Local Court by the police.42 His Honour stood the matter over for mention on 15 October 2008, when the matter came before me. The appellant was unrepresented once again, as he has been unrepresented throughout the proceedings before me. There was no appearance for Ryde City Council.43 He outlined the nature of his appeal from which it became clear that his appeal against sentence was misconceived in the circumstances, and that his purpose was to have the opportunity to defend the charge, which first required a determination whether he should have leave to appeal from the decision in the Local Court not to grant the annulment of the conviction.44 I adjourned the matter until 23 October 2008 so that the Ryde City Council might appear. They failed to do so. I again adjourned the matter to 30 October 2008 and directed that written notice of the next listing be given to Ryde City Council. On 24 October 2008 a Notice of Listing from the Registrar of the District Court, Parramatta informed the council of the following, 
     
      
      This matter is listed for Mention on 30 October 2008 at 10:00 AM , at PARRAMATTA. 
      
     
     
      
      If you do not appear at Court, this matter may be dealt with you your absence. 
      
     
     
      
      Note: Boulghourgian advised to acquire a transcript of proceedings in Ryde Local Court. 
      
    45 The Registrar received a letter from the Ryde City Council, bearing the date 22 October 2008, by facsimile transmission of that date, under the hand of a person representing himself as General Counsel. The letter said, 
     
      
      I am the solicitor for the prosecutor in the abovementioned proceedings. 
      
     
     
      
      I note that the proceedings are listed for appeal before the District Court tomorrow. The Council is unable to appear but has no objection to the Court disposing of the appeal. 
      
     
     
      
      As the appeal relates only to sentence, the Council would not have adduced any evidence other than that on the Court file (section 17,  
      Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 
       2001) and would consider it a matter for the Court what penalty to impose. 
      
     
     
      
      For the Court’s assistance, the Council notes that the maximum penalty for the subject offence (clause 167 of the  
      Road Rules 
        
      Act 
       2008) is $2,200 (20 penalty units).

    46 As I recall, the letter was not placed before me on 23 October 2008, but I saw it on 30 October 2008. I was also informed that the appellant was having difficulty obtaining the transcript of the proceedings before Magistrate Betts. I made orders that the Ryde City Council be contacted once more with the results of this mention, and that a transcript of the Local Court proceedings be taken out and placed on file. I stood the matter over for mention before me in the District Court, Sydney on 13 November 2008. I ordered that written notice of that listing be sent to the Ryde City Council.47 The Registrar sent a Notice of Listing dated 4 November 2008 to Ryde City Council by the Registrar. On the same day the Registrar wrote to the Local Court informing them that the transcript was ordered, and asking them to attend to it as a matter of urgency.48 A facsimile of that document was transmitted on the same day to Ryde City Council. The document made clear the nature of the proceedings before me. The letter includes the following, 
     
      
      On 11/7/08, the abovenamed appeared at your court in relation to a S 4 annulment application. 
       
      The presiding magistrate refused the application and the defendant subsequently lodged an appeal against that decision. 
      
    49 On 13 November 2008 the appellant appeared but Ryde City Council did not. The matter could not proceed on that day because of other work before the court, and was adjourned to 27 November 2008 when the appellant presented the evidence.50 As I have noted, the appellant does not speak English as his first language, and he was unrepresented throughout these proceedings. Notwithstanding these limitations, he was able to conduct the application for leave to appeal appropriately when pointed towards each step required for the hearing of the matter. I informed him that it would be necessary to tender the court file if it was his wish for me to have evidence of the proceedings in the Local Court, and he did so. When I informed him that the findings of fact to be made relevant to his application depended upon evidence, including evidence that he might wish to give, he chose to enter the witness box, was sworn, and gave evidence. I interrupted him when irrelevant material was offered, and asked questions to ensure that I had a complete understanding of his memory of events, and the reasons for his application.51 If the representatives of Ryde City Council had made the decision to appear in response to the correspondence sent to them this matter might well have been resolved well before now. I find their attitude to the court and their disregard of the obligations they have as litigants in matters such as this to be unsatisfactory.The Decision Refusing the Annulment52 The transcript of her Honour’s remarks imply that she was in some measure irritated by the decision to pass work to her court from the Parramatta Local Court, and that she was focused upon that issue when she decided to refuse the application for annulment. If it be the case that Mr Boulghourgian was at the court earlier in the day, when Parramatta City Council was represented by a solicitor to inform the court that proceedings brought against him by the council were being discontinued, it appears that she did not appreciate the significance that appearance might have had when it came to deal with this matter. It does not appear that her Honour made any attempt to review the court file, or make any examination of the documents that were before her relevant to this prosecution from which she might have gleaned whether Mr Boulghourgian was intending to pursue the matter, and she has given no indication of any thought that there might be an explanation for his absence at the time that this matter was called. The assistance to be gained from the police prosecutor would be minimal, since Ryde City Council was the authority responsible for the prosecution and there is no indication that there was any representative present to appear on behalf of the informant, or the council, to assist the court with the conduct of the matter.53 Her Honour did not refer to the provisions pursuant to which the application for annulment was brought. Neither is there any indication that her Honour was assisted with authority, such as Miller v DPP [2004] NSWCA 90, wherein there is to be found appropriate guidance upon such an application. Of course the decision simply to refuse the application when Mr Boulghourgian was not present in court at the time the matter was mentioned, without any further consideration of why he might have been absent, obviated the need for her Honour to turn her mind to the principles relevant to the decision whether or not to grant the application.54 It would have been preferable, with all due respect, if her Honour had taken time to review the file, and explore the possibility that Mr Boulghourgian was not present from some reason other than his disregard of the proceedings. I have no reason to reject his evidence about events earlier in the day at the court. Indeed I found him to be a reliable witness, and I accept his evidence about the appearance earlier in the day, after which, believing all matters there were resolved, he departed to go about his business.The Determination of the Appeal55 The legislation governing the conduct of the proceedings before her Honour, and now in this court, are found in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. They were introduced into this Act from the Justices Act 1902 where comparable provisions first provided the scheme for the ex parte disposal of charges for criminal offences.56 Section 4 provides relevantly: 
     
      
      (1) An application for annulment of a conviction or sentence made or imposed by a Local Court may be made to the same Local Court:  
       
        
        (a) by the defendant, or 
         
        (b) … 
        
       
       but may be made by the defendant only if the defendant was not in appearance before the Local Court when the conviction or sentence was made or imposed. 
       
      (2) An application under this section must be made: 
       
        
        (a) within 2 years after the relevant conviction or sentence is made or imposed, or 
         
        (b) … 
        
       
      (3) … 
       
      (4) An application must be in writing, and must be lodged with a registrar of a Local Court. 
       
      (5) … 
      
    57 The appellant was not in appearance before the Local Court when the conviction was entered in his absence. His application for annulment was made within two years thereafter. The application was lodged in writing.58 Section 8 provides, emphasis added, 
     
      
      (1) … 
       
      (2) A Local Court  
      must 
       grant an application for annulment made by the defendant if it is satisfied: 
       
        
        (a) that the defendant was not aware of the original Local Court proceedings until after the proceedings were completed, or 
         
        (b) that the defendant was otherwise hindered by accident, illness, misadventure or other cause from taking action in relation to the original Local Court proceedings, or 
         
        (c) that, having regard to the circumstances of the case, it is in the interests of justice to do so. 
        
       
      
    59 Section 9 sets down the procedure to be followed when an order for annulment is made, and s 10 sets out the effect of an order of annulment.60 Part 3 of the Act provides for appeals to the District Court from the Local Court.61 Section 11A provides, 
     
      
      (1) Any defendant whose application under section 4 for annulment of a conviction or sentence has been refused by the Local Court may appeal to the District Court against the refusal. 
       
      (2) An appeal under this section must be made within 28 days after the Local Court notifies the defendant of its refusal of the application. 
       
      (3) … 
      
    62 The application for leave to appeal, with a copy of the notice of appeal upon the grounds of severity attached, and the notice of appeal were lodged on 19 September 2008, after the decision rejecting the application on 11 August 2008, and outside of the 28 day period. Leave is therefore required; s 13(1)(a1).63 I shall grant leave to Mr Boulghourgian to appeal from the decision not to grant the annulment. As I have noted he is unrepresented, English is not his first language, and his lack of knowledge of the procedures that must be followed in these matters is understandable. His failure to lodge appropriate documents within the time constraints provided in this legislation should be assessed against these limitations.64 Section 14 provides relevantly, 
     
      
      (1) An appeal under section … 11A is to be made by lodging a written notice of appeal with: 
       
        
        (a) the registrar of any Local Court, or 
         
        (b) the person in charge of the place where the appellant is in custody. 
        
       
      (2) A notice of appeal must state the general grounds of appeal. 
       
      (3) … 
       
      (4) 
       … 
       
      (5) … 
      
    65 Regrettably, the document as presented is deficient in this regard if taken alone. However, when read against the evidence proffered by Mr Boulghourgian the grounds are made clear.66 Briefly stated, they were that he is not guilty of the offence of which he has been convicted; he has been the victim of identity fraud by or at the instance of the person who did commit this and other offences of which he has been accused; the number of proceedings consequently brought against him confused him as to the date upon which this charge was to be heard; and thereafter, he believed the conviction to have been annulled when the proceedings brought by the Parramatta City Council were dealt with earlier in the day upon which the application for the annulment was in fact refused. In these circumstances, he was hindered by misadventure from taking action in relation to the original proceedings and, moreover, having regard to the circumstances of the case it is in the interests of justice that the conviction be annulled.67 I find that the grounds expressed in the application for leave to appeal are sufficient to state the general grounds of appeal.68 Miller v DPP was concerned with a decision by a magistrate not to grant an annulment of a conviction entered in the appellant’s absence, upon findings that he simply chose not to attend court on the day appointed. The magistrate had evidence from a medical practitioner who spoke to the impaired health of the appellant and said that he was unfit to appear at court on the day when the proceedings were to resume. The doctor had examined the appellant that day and concluded that he was unfit to appear in court, and would continue to be unfit over the ensuing days. He said that his difficulty arose from the failure to follow advice regarding his cardiac care.69 Regardless of this evidence, the magistrate took the view that the appellant was not hindered by illness or other cause from taking action in relation to the relevant proceedings. She noted that he could make contact with his solicitor in order to seek an adjournment, and simply chose not to attend court.70 An appeal to the Supreme Court before Dowd J failed, but a further appeal to the Court of Appeal succeeded and the matter was remitted to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law. Their Honours held that the finding by the magistrate was not open to her on the evidence.71 The court reviewed the relevant provisions of the Justices Act comparable to those with which the court is here dealing, and with regard to the second reading speech presented upon their introduction. Although the present legislation is not in identical terms to that under review in Miller v DPP, their Honours’ remarks are apposite. Sheller JA, with whom Beazley JA and Young CJ in Equity agreed, concluded that the use of the words ‘must grant an application for annulment’ required the Local Court to grant the application if the conditions specified were satisfied. Moreover, the phrase ‘from taking action in relation to the original Local Court proceedings’ was not to be construed narrowly. His Honour said at paragraphs [24] and [25], 
     
      
      [The phrase] is clearly part of a scheme to avoid the obvious injustice to a defendant who is unable, properly, to defend the case against him, on the day he is convicted in his or her absence, because of an accident, illness or misadventure or other cause. 
      
     
     
      
      The use of the word “hindered” is instructive. It does not only mean “prevented” but also “impeded” or “obstructed”. There are no doubt many ways in which this can happen and it is not desirable, even if possible to catalogue them here. The basis for the application is that the conviction was made in the absence of the defendant. It seems to me quite obvious that if the appellant was prevented from coming to court on 10 December 2001 because of illness, that falls well within the ambit of the expression “hindered by illness from taking action in relation to the proceedings”. It is not to my mind, significant or any answer to such a claim that the appellant was well enough to telephone his solicitor or to write a letter. To conclude otherwise, defeats the intention of the legislation. 
      
    72 Justice Young contributed further comment, noting that the second reading speech gave the clear impression that the aim of the amendments introduced was to liberalise the circumstances in which convictions before magistrates where the accused had not appeared could be annulled. In my opinion the further amendments made upon the introduction of this legislation into the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act have not reversed or introduced limits to that liberalisation.73 His Honour rehearsed the history of these provisions through their various iterations, noting that they once expressly included a series of discrete situations where a defendant might have a conviction annulled. At paragraph [38] his Honour said, 
     
      
      Under s 100K(2)(a), the defendant can apply if he or she was not aware of the relevant proceedings until after their completion, but cases where there was some problem with communication of the adjourned date or a date was wrongly written down in somebody’s diary ceased to be matters explicitly mentioned in the statute. 
      
    74 Section 100K(2)(a) was expressed in the following way, 
     
      
      A Local Court must grant an application if the applicant is a person other than the informant and it if is satisfied that the defendant was not aware of the relevant proceedings until the proceedings were completed or the sentence imposed or the other action was taken, 
      
    75 His Honour continued at paragraph [39], 
     
      
      This must lead to the view that the general paragraphs of subs (2)(b) and (c) of s 100K(2) or s 8(2) of the 2001 Act should be widely construed. Thus in (b) the word “misadventure” should be read widely. 
      
    76 Section 100K(2)(b) and (c) of the Justices Act were the comparable, although not identical predecessors to sections 8(2)(b) and (c) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act by which this scheme is continued. The differences between these provisions as expressed do not detract from his Honour’s statements.77 His Honour continued with references to authority in support of the proposition that the word “hindered” meant something less than prevented, namely, making something more or less difficult but not impossible, or alternatively, affecting to an appreciable extent the activity in question. Of the phrase “taking action in relation to the relevant proceedings” his Honour said at paragraph [41], 
     
      
      … the legislature has chosen wide vague words with the intention that if the defendant is hindered by misadventure or otherwise from doing some act or thing in relation to the proceedings not limited to attending court, then a magistrate would have jurisdiction under the section to annul the conviction or sentence. 
      
    78 The merit of these provisions, which allow for the expeditious disposal of proceedings before magistrates where an accused person chooses not to appear cannot be questioned. Their implementation saves the cost and inconvenience that would otherwise be incurred by requiring the use of resources and the presence of witnesses to present evidence to prove offences, in respect of which an accused person may properly submit to a finding of guilt without the formalities that might otherwise be required.79 However, as the Court of Appeal has made abundantly clear, the legislation was not intended to produce injustice. Those accused who wish to defend the charges brought against them must be permitted to do so.80 Failure of an accused wishing to defend the charges against them to attend court, through mere oversight, should not result in a finding of guilt and conviction as a matter of course. Where an accused person has made an error, such as by losing the note of the date of the hearing, and whilst operating under the genuine but mistaken belief that his day in court was to be on a day other than the day upon which the matter was in fact to be heard, he or she has been hindered by misadventure or otherwise from doing an act in relation to the proceedings, namely, from attending on the appointed day.The Decision81 For these reasons I propose to allow the appeal.82 Section 16A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act provides, 
     
      
      (1) The District Court may determine an application under section 11A by dismissing the application or by granting it. 
       
      (2) Pending the determination of the application, the District Court may stay the execution of the sentence concerned subject to such terms and conditions as it thinks fit. 
       
      (3) If the District Court grants the application, the District Court must remit the matter to the Local Court. 
       
      (4) The Local Court is to deal under section 9 with any matter remitted to it under this section as if the application under section 4 in respect of the matter had been granted by the Local Court. 
      
    83 Although this provision refers to an application under section 11A, the term used in section 11A is “appeal”. It would appear that the intention of the legislation is that if the appellant is successful, this Court will grant the application for annulment.84 This Court does not substitute its view of the facts relevant to whether the prosecution has or will be able to prove the guilt of the appellant beyond reasonable doubt. Once the decision is made to grant the annulment denied in the Local Court, the matter must be remitted to the Local Court to be dealt with under s 9 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act as if the application for annulment had been granted in the Local Court. Thus, when the matter is returned to the Local Court any magistrate may deal with the matter, but must do so afresh and as if no conviction or sentence had been previously imposed.Order 
     
      
     1. Grant application for leave to appeal from decision to refuse application for annulment. 
      
     2. Allow the appeal. 
      
     3. Set aside the order of Magistrate Betts on 11 August 2008. 
      
     4. Grant the application for the annulment of the conviction of 20 June 2008 for the offence of Disobey No Stopping Sign 
      
     5. Remit the proceedings to the Local Court to be dealt with according to law.

   JUDGMENTApplication to exclude pretext conversation between Complainant and Accused.1. Sione Taulata Vito has pleaded not guilty to six charges of sexually assaulting T. Mc. Five of the charges are sexual intercourse without consent, knowing T. Mc. was not consenting. The remaining charge is an allegation of attempting to have anal sexual intercourse without consent. All offences are said to have occurred on the 17th February 2007.The Crown Case2. The Crown case is that the complainant met the accused on a dance floor at the Vandenberg Hotel, Forbes sometime after 11:30pm on Friday 16th February 2007. She was a local; he was visiting from Orange. Both by this time had consumed significant quantities of alcohol. After some initial reluctance the complainant chose to dance with the accused, was impressed with his physique, his charm and courtesy towards her. Again after some initial reluctance, she consented to his coming to her residence in Forbes. They talked over a drink and ultimately she made to retire to bed. He did not leave the residence, but shortly after made his way to her bedroom. While not exactly welcoming him, neither did she shoo him out. He lay on the bed, one thing led to another and they kissed each other. Both, under the blankets, ended up naked. There was consensual sexual foreplay by each towards the other. That in turn led to the complainant performing fellatio upon the accused. It was only a matter of seconds before she felt the accused grab the back of her hair, and thrust her head down the shaft of his erect penis with force. For her it was as though a different person had entered her bed. That event was followed by the penile penetration of her vagina (count 1). She called upon him to stop. He refused to listen or comply. Having cum on her vagina and stomach, he left the bed for the bathroom, threw a hand towel to her saying, “Clean yourself up.”3. He took a shower, returning five minutes later. The complainant had retreated to the lounge room. She told him he had to go, that he couldn’t stay. He pushed her on the lounge so that her stomach was on the lounge, knees on the floor, and back towards him. He placed his hands on her back forcefully trapping her. Using his erect penis he entered her from behind, for penile vaginal intercourse (second count). The complainant said, “Please don’t do this.” He did not stop. 4. From the lounge she ended lying face down on the floor next to it. Initially he maintained his penetration of her vagina. She called on him to stop, he did not. Then he withdrew his penis from her vagina and attempted to have anal intercourse with her. He penis would not enter her anus. (third count). Unsuccessful on that attempt he re-entered her vagina having penile vaginal intercourse with her (fourth count). He ejulactated on the outside of her vagina and on her buttocks. She commenced crying. Again she wiped his semen from her using the hand towel earlier thrown to her by the accused. Again she asked him to leave.5. He used his mobile phone to speak to a friend; she retreated to her bedroom, lying in bed terrified. When he finished his call, he again followed her into the bedroom; entered her bed and commenced to kiss her. He entered beneath the covers engaging in foreplay. He penetrated her vagina with his fingers (count 5), rolled her onto her back, moved on top of her and commenced to have penile vaginal intercourse with her (count 6). Again he withdrew and ejaculated on her vagina and stomach. 6. By now it was 9:30am. 17th February. She offered to drive him down the street, returned home, showered and then complained to one of her friends. On 18th February she reported the matter to police. On 27th February she made a 48-paragraph statement. On 8th March 2007 she attended the Forbes police station where she met Dt S/Constable Scott Wilcox. At the request of police she telephoned the accused’s mobile number. The accused and complainant had exchanged mobile phone numbers sometime early on 17th February. He answered the phone. She engaged him in conversation. Significantly in that call she sought out his address, employment details and a response to her challenge to him in respect of his treatment of her on the morning of 17th February 2007.The Defence Case7. Both the Crown and I understand the defence case is an acceptance of the alleged sexual acts, but a claim the complainant consented, or if there was an absence of consent, the accused had no knowledge that she was not consenting. Although, defence counsel said the accused when arrested made “general denials” at that time, and later exercised his right to silence.An objection is made8. The defence objects to the tender of the CD containing the voice sounds of the interchange between complainant and accused in this call. The defence argument is that it contains no admissions, and therefore has no probative value at all. Alternatively, the argument is that the complainant was an agent of the police when the call was made, and in that capacity was required to caution the accused that anything he said could be used in evidence against him. The defence relies upon s. 90 and s. 138 of the Evidence Act 1995.The Pretext Phone Call – preparation9. Dt S/Constable Wilcox applied for a warrant under the Listening Devices Act 1984 on the 7th March 2007. His Affidavit in support of the warrant Dt Wilcox reviews the forensic progress that had to that point been made in his investigations. He makes clear he regards the accused as the only suspect, that he is seized of all details the Complainant has given to him in her detailed 48 paragraph statement. Dt Wilcox also had the accused contact mobile phone number. 10. Dt Wilcox either had evidence from one Bernadette Davis, an associate of the Complainant’s, or access to her for the purposes of obtaining evidence that she had called the accused on the 17th February obtaining evidence that he was at the Vandenberg Hotel on the night of 16th February 2007. There was further evidence from an Orange based police officer, Constable Webster, who spoke to the accused in the early morning of 17th February at the Vandenberg. By the time of his affidavit Dt Wilcox would have had the hand towel and a pair of socks said to be the accused’s given to him by the complainant, knowing there was a potential for DNA evidence from one or other or both.11. Once in possession of the accused’s mobile phone number Police initiated enquiries with the telecommunications providers. They were provided information that the phone was subscribed by Leonie Vito of Pinpala Place Orange. Police records placed the accused at that address on 2nd June 2006. 12. Police Records showed the accused had a criminal history that included violence and breaches of apprehended violence orders. It was also discovered he was on bail for an unrelated sexual intercourse without consent charge, having some similarities to the instant case. When arrested on 8 November 2004 (nearly 3 years earlier) an interpreter was required due to the accused’s then limited English. Constable Webster confirmed that while the accused English is still limited, he was capable of having a conversation. Both Davis and the Complainant had only spoken to the accused in English. Apparently they had been understood by him, and he by them without difficulty.13. Dt Wilcox was seeking to strengthen the Crown case by using a connection between complainant and accused in the hope of generating conversation between Complainant and accused in respect of the sexual assaults complained of by her. I am satisfied he was also seeking to obtain details of the accused’s current address. Whether he had details of the address is uncertain. What I am confident of is that he had the means of ascertaining the accused’s address by other means if it was necessary. The police at Orange knew the accused. He was also on bail, which probably had reporting conditions. There was also a forensic gain for the prosecution if a telephone interchange between accused and complainant could establish the accused’s fluency in English was sufficient to corroborate the Complainant’s account of their meeting at the Vandenberg hotel. It could also establish that he was capable of understanding her when she rejected his sexual approaches, told him to leave and that she did not want to be his girlfriend.14. Dt Wilcox’s evidence is: 
     
      
      Well, we wanted to … secure the evidence and get evidence of the relationship between the two and also that Mr Vito had, indeed, come to Forbes and met Ms T Mc and they had gone back to her house and that something happened and at that time there was no other way of getting evidence, other than conversation between the two. (Trans 16/12/08 p.14). 
      
    15. Dt Wilcox’s evidence is that he would not have arrested the accused on the information he had prior to the phone call. I am satisfied Dt Wilcox had made a decision not to arrest the accused prior to making an application for a warrant authorising a listening device. I am satisfied that at the time he made the application there was credible and sufficient information available to Dt Wilcox to suspect on reasonable grounds that the accused had committed a number of offences contrary to sexual assault provisions of the Crimes Act 1900.(see s.99 Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002). 16. There is however a difference between having the power to arrest a person and being compelled to exercise the arrest power. So far as I am aware there is nothing in law or common sense requiring a police officer to arrest a suspect when reasonable grounds exist, if further investigative procedures may provide an opportunity of strengthening the available evidence against that suspect. I am satisfied Dt Wilcox was seeking to strengthen the evidence against the accused. Had his application for a listening device warrant been refused, there is little doubt Dt Wilcox would have been entitled, subject to other provisions of the Law Enforcement (Power and Responsibilities) Act to arrest the accused, and it is likely he would have done so. More importantly, as at 8th March 2007 Dt Wilcox had sufficient evidence available for him to charge the accused, but he was not obligated to do so, particularly if further investigation could strengthen the case against the accused.17. It follows from all this, that the accused was not an arrested suspect at the time of the call. It also follows Dt Wilcox was still pursuing investigative initiatives. That is to say, the case was still in its investigative stage, even though Dt Wilcox had settled upon the accused as the sole suspect.Making the Telephone Call18. On the morning of the call a listening device was installed. The complainant attended the police station to make the call pursuant to an arrangement earlier made. She was given an opportunity to look at the equipment she was to use. She understood the call was to be recorded.19. There was discussion about desirable topics that could be covered in the call. These included making conversation, seeking the accused’s address, and work place. She was asked, if she felt up to engaging him in conversation about the events of the 16th - 17th February. No specific questions were written out – as I say, potential topics were mentioned. I have no doubt the complainant believed the discussions she was to embark upon might produce, and were intended to produce if possible, further evidence against the accused. Of course she would also have appreciated the nature of the evidence being sought was self-incriminatory evidence coming directly from the accused. 20. From Dt Wilcox’s perspective, any acknowledgement of the complainant by the accused in the phone call would have been regarded as a successful outcome. Anything over and above such an acknowledgement would be a bonus.21. The procedure involving the call took 11minutes commencing 12:50pm. on Thursday 8th March. It would be open for a tribunal of fact to glean the following from the call: 
     
     The accused was a willing participant in the call. All that was said by him in the call was voluntarily spoken. 
     That vis a vis the complainant and himself, the accused was at no disadvantage speaking to her. They were speaking as equals. There was no power imbalance. Nor was there any difficulty one had understanding or speaking to the other. 
     The accused was not aware the call was being captured by recording, or that it was being obtained for evidential purposes, or that the complainant was at the Forbes police station, or was in anyway connected with, or potentially oversighted by police during the call. 
     The accused enthusiastically recognised the complainant and was pleased to speak to her. At the conclusion of the call he told her he loved her. 
     The accused was keen to pursue the complainant, including welcoming her to Orange, or attending Forbes to see her there. 
     The accused had sought to contact the complainant on more than one occasion since their last encounter. 
     The accused willingly gave the complainant his residential address. 
     The accused willingly gave to the complainant details of his employer and the nature of the work he performed. 
     When confronted by the complainant with the proposition that when they were having sex, she had asked him to stop, and he didn’t, the accused did not question the assertion, nor deny it, but rather sought to explain it by professing a love for her; and subsequently apologising, and returned to the apology late in the call. 
     The complainant was fearful the accused may visit her in Forbes within the relative immediate future, and was keen to avoid any meeting with the accused. She may have been concerned he knew her address and told him she was moving. The accused sought to ingratiate himself with the complainant by offering to help. She sought to avoid having him assist her. A fair reading of this passage would suggest while he was sincere in his desire to help, she was fabricating her intention of moving from Forbes. 
     The accused nominated others who were at the Vandenberg Hotel with him on the night of 16th February. 
     The accused went to Bedgerebong, returned possibly to Forbes, and waited in a motel room from which he rang the complainant, reasonably expecting her to pick him up. He left his motel room to go to “the facility” where he waited outside until early morning, returning to the motel room about 2:00am when “we” went to bed. As presently advised the full significance of that matter is unclear. 
     The accused conceded he was really drunk on the 16th – 17th February. 
    22. The Court had the opportunity of hearing the voices of the parties participating in the call. The tone, timbre and expression of the voices, particularly the voice of the accused, gives an impact to the evidence flowing from the call that is missing in the transcript.The defence submissions23. The Crown had argued the relevance of the telephone call was that it provided admissions against interest by the accused and evidence supportive of the Crown case. The defence in answer to the argument that the call provided evidence of admissions submitted there is nothing contained within the interview that constitutes an admission because there was nothing said by the accused that amounted to or was capable of amounting to an acceptance of the proposition put by the complainant that she and the accused had had sex together, that she had asked him to stop, and that he had not stopped.24. Alternatively, it was argued the evidence generated by the telephone call failed the tests laid down by s.138 and s.90 of the Evidence Act 1995. The defence position was that, but for the intervention of police the call would not have been made between complainant and accused, and some of the matters discussed, including the accused address, workplace, and events of the 16th and 17th February, would not have been discussed. In those circumstances the Complainant was an agent for the police, and in that capacity obliged to caution the accused that anything he said could be used as evidence against him.The Crown Submissions25. The Crown argued the failure of the accused to deny the allegation when it was put to him, and apologies, multiple times are not equivocal, but responses made by the accused in response to the allegations put to him by the complainant. As such they are capable of amounting to admissions within the broad definition contained in the Evidence Act 1995.26. In respect to the covertness of recording of the conversation between complainant and police, the question of whether there was any intention to arrest the accused at that point is not determinative of admissibility. What is determinative is whether the complainant was, in fact, a state agent, whether there is material, which has been used in obtaining the admissions which makes it unfair.The Question – Admissions or not?27. The Dictionary contained in the Evidence Act defines “admission” in these terms: Admission means a representation that is: 
     
      
      a.) made by a person who is or becomes a party to a proceeding (including a defendant in a criminal proceeding); and 
       
      b.) adverse to the person’s interest in the outcome of the proceeding. 
      
    28. In one way or another the following representations come within that definition: the accused’s recognition of the complainant, his keenness to pursue her; his seeking contact with her on an occasion subsequent to the 17th February; his declared on-going interest in the complainant; his absence of denial of what otherwise was an allegation of criminal and anti-relationship behaviour of continuing to have sex with her when she was not consenting; alternatively, his failure to volunteer that he didn’t realise she was not consenting or some other explanation that went to the issue; his offering an explanation that sought to excuse the behaviour “I love you”; his on-going apologies commencing with the making of the allegation; his concession that he was very drunk; and his level of fluency in English as exhibiting a capacity to understand English to a level where he would know words of rejection such as “stop”, “get out” “leave now” and the like. As I have already indicated, each of these representations is available to the tribunal of fact on a fair hearing of the recorded phone call. 29. Mr Pickin, counsel for the accused sought to argue the admissions if they existed were so equivocal they should be withheld from the jury. He sought to rely upon a Queensland case of Reg v Doolan [1962] Q. L. R. 449 as authority for the proposition. With respect, Doolan is not authority for such a proposition. Police showed to the accused, Doolan, a copy of a statement from an alleged co-offender implicating him as having a role in an assault and robbery. Doolan’s comment upon reading the statement was:  
     
      
      I thought that bastard had more bloody sense than to give you fellows a statement. He has dubbed us all in.” 
      
    30. Upon that basis it was apparently sought to tender the written statement of the co-offender as evidence against the accused. Townley J, with whom Mansfield C.J and Philp J agreed said: 
     
      
      [The accused’s] comment was, to say the least, equivocal and, in my opinion, could not be taken as an unequivocal admission of the truth of the contents of the statement…Here I think the appellant’s comment was such that it would be dangerous to accept it as an admission of the truth of the facts stated in Tallis’s written statement. 
       
       
      In the circumstances I have related I am of the opinion that the appellant was at the least entitled to a direction to the jury that it would be dangerous to convict him. I therefore think that  
      the conviction should be quashed 
       and that 
       a retrial on the indictment should not be ordered 
      . (emphasis mine) 
      
    31. As can be seen the “representation” in Doolan was put to a different use than the admissions are sought to be put in this case. Secondly, the case is not authority for withdrawing equivocal evidence, but rather curing by direction the impact of weak evidence. Finally, the use made of the equivocal statement by Townley was to base a finding the accused had been entitled to a direction that it would be dangerous to convict him, and then as a factor involved in His Honour’s exercise of discretion as to whether or not a new trial should be ordered. 32. Of course, the problem that arose in Doolan might be avoided by the application of s.137 of the Evidence Act. Although no formal application has been made by the defence for me so to do, I have considered whether the probative value outweighs the danger of unfair prejudice. In considering that issue, not only do I turn my mind to the question of the probative value of the various admissions in the Crown case, but also the corroborative value of the admissions that a jury may accept as being made. The crown case is comforted by the support the complainant’s evidence receives from the representations made by the accused in the telephone conversation. 33. The unfairness consideration evoked by s.137 relates to the probative value arising from the telephone call measured against the danger of unfair prejudice arising from the evidence created by the telephone call. That is, will the evidence provoke some irrational emotional response, or give the evidence, unfairly, more weight than it deserves. So expressed, I am unable to foresee any danger of unfair prejudice arising from the evidence. That is not to say, I do not undervalue the damage this evidence may have on the defence case – but that is not the test. 34. In all the circumstances I reject the defence argument that there are no admissions contained in the pretext telephone conversation.Do the pretext conversation admissions fail the tests of s.90 and 138?35. Before analysing whether the pretext admissions fail the tests of s.90 and s138 it is necessary to indicate two finding I have made. Firstly, I am satisfied the conversation between the complainant and accused would not have been made, but for the intervention of Dt Wilcox. The Complainant’s view of the accused was that he was reprehensible, and the last thing on earth she wanted was to contact him. She was persuaded to do so because she believed (whether after discussion with Dt Wilcox or not does not need to be determined) that the case against the accused would be strengthened. I suspect this conclusion was obvious once it was explained to her what topics the proposed conversation would cover. 36. Secondly, the structure and content of the call were not mandatitorily imposed upon the complainant. But the structure the call actually took was significantly influenced by suggestions made by Dt Wilcox before the call began. Topics, other than topics suggested by Dt Wilcox were discussed between complainant and accused, particularly on those occasions where she was seeking to avoid future contact with the accused in Forbes. The complainant’s conversation was not scripted, nor targeted to elicit specific admissions as may have occurred in a record of interview. What was hoped for, and intended by the suggestions made by Dt Wilcox were admissions to general propositions – such as “what happened on the 17th” as distinct from “did you try to penetrate my anus with your penis when we were on the couch”.37. S. 90 of the Evidence Act provides:90 Discretion to exclude admissions 
     
      
      In a criminal proceeding, the court may refuse to admit evidence of an admission, or refuse to admit evidence to prove a particular fact, if: 
       
        
        a.) the evidence is adduced by the prosecution; and 
         
        b.) having regard to the circumstances in which the admission was made, it would be unfair to a defendant to use the evidence. 
        
       
      
    38. Although in the minority, Kirby J in Em v The Queen (2007) 239 ALR 204 at pp 248-249 sets out a very useful analysis of textual features of s.90 relevant to the proper exercise of power for which it provides. While I concede it is sometimes difficult to tell, it does not appear to me either of the judgments dismissing the appeal, call into question this analysis. 
     
     First the section is limited in its application to evidence “adduced by the prosecution” in a “criminal proceeding”. Thus s.90 is confined in its operation to a particular type of trial which, in Australia, has distinctive features. Most importantly, criminal proceedings in this country normally observe an accusatorial principle by which it is for the prosecution to establish the criminal accusation. The defendant is not usually required by law to say or prove anything. The specific context is thus that of admitting evidence of an admission which, by our law, normally a defendant is not required to make but which is contained in the evidence adduced by the prosecution and proffered against the defendant. Whether, in these circumstances admission of the evidence would be “unfair” needs to be judged taking into account these peculiarities that lie deep in the Australian system of criminal justice. 
     
     
     The “unfairness” that enlivens s.90 is not at large. It is not related to broader considerations such as unfairness to the community, unfairness to investigating police, unfairness to witnesses or to any other person or thing. The sole consideration is unfairness “to a defendant”. This focuses the inquiry on the effect of the “circumstances in which the admission was made” on the defendant as such. The impact on a wider range of persons or values must be considered, if at all, under other exclusionary rules provided by the Act, not under s.90. 
     
     
     The unfairness “to [the] defendant” is also not at large. It is not addressed to unfairness to the defendant outside the courtroom. It is only in the criminal proceedings where that person is “a defendant”, and the relevant evidence is tendered for admission, that the admission may be excluded because it would be unfair to the defendant to use it in such proceedings. 
     
     
     The criterion for rejection of the evidence is not the way in which it might later be used by the tribunal of fact. That would involve a concern with unfair prejudice to which other sections of the Act are directed, such as s.135 (a general discretion to exclude evidence) or s.137 (a special discretion to exclude prejudicial evidence in criminal proceedings). As noted above, the several provisions for the exclusion of evidence necessarily overlap in some circumstances. They operate alternatively and cumulatively. An accused person is entitled to invoke any and all of the provisions that are alleged to be relevant to the proceedings in hand. In a statute of general application, the existence of differently expressed powers of exclusion that may, in a given case, have more particular application to the circumstances of a trial is not a reason for reading down the alternative grounds for exclusion provided by the Act, including s.90. 
    39. Kirby J. in the same case also notes that once a court, in circumstances to which s.90 applies, concludes that it “would be unfair to the defendant to use the evidence” the section does not provide the court with an uncontrolled option to allow the evidence or to reject it or to limit its use. If the relevant unfairness to a defendant in the use of the evidence is demonstrated, the only discretion provided is to refuse to admit the evidence of an admission at all, or to refuse to admit the evidence to prove a particular fact.40. Kirby J’s point requires recognition of the differing issues required to be decided by s.137 and s.138. In s.90 the focus is upon a question of whether there is an “unfairness to the defendant” in using the evidence. S.137 requires an evaluation of “the danger of unfair prejudice to the defendant”, and s. 138 requires (assuming contravention of an Australian law or an impropriety) an assessment of “the desirability of admitting the evidence outweighing the undesirability of admitting the evidence”. The s.90 enquiry is limited to one of determining a question of “unfairness” to the defendant. The s.137 and s.138 enquiries are of broader scope. What constitutes “unfair prejudice” to a defendant and issues relating to “desirability” and “undesirability” of admitting evidence involve among other things policy considerations.41. In determining the question of unfairness it is as well to keep in mind remarks of Brennan CJ in Swaffield (1998) 192 CLR 169 at [35].  
     
      
      …The investigation of crime is not a game governed by a sportsman’s code of fair play. Fairness to those suspected of crime is not the giving of a sporting opportunity to escape the consequences of any legitimate and proper investigation or the giving of a sufficient opportunity ‘to invent plausible falsehoods’. 
      
    42. In the same case Kirby J postulated the test of unfairness thus: 
     
      
      In the case of covertly obtained confessions, the line of forbidden conduct will be crossed if the confession may be said to have been elicited by police (or by a person acting as an agent of the police) in  
      unfair 
       derogation of the suspect’s right to exercise a free choice to speak or to be silent.” (emphasis mine) 
      
    43. What seems apparent from this test is that some “derogation” of a suspect’s rights may not qualify as being “unfair”. While some may have difficulty recognising this concept as a matter of logic reasoning, those more familiar with the law would recognise it as a workable legal principle. “Unfair derogation” is not a tautology in the law.44. In the context of a pretext conversation the right to exercise a free choice to speak will be unfairly infringed where the civilian caller is acting as an agent of the state and the evidence objected to was elicited. 45. The Canadian authorities regard a civilian caller (referred to as ”informer” below) as being the agent of the state:  
     
      
      [o]nly if the relationship between the informer and the state is such that the exchange between the informer and the accused is  
      materially 
       different from what it would have been had there been no such relationship, should the informer be considered a state agent for the purposes of the exchange. (emphasis mine)  
      Broyles v The Queen 
       [1991] 3 S.C.R. 595 at [30] per Iacobucci J. 
      
    46. In Broyles Iacobucci J dealt at some length on the concept of elicitation. Issues such as “did the state agent actively seek out information such that the exchange could be characterised as akin to an interrogation” (at [38]) or was the conduct and tone of the civilian caller during the conversation as someone in the role the accused believed he/she would ordinarily have done. His Honour said,  
     
      
      The focus should not be on the form of the conversation, but rather on whether the relevant parts of the conversation were the functional equivalent of an interrogation.” Ibid. 
      
    47. Also of relevance to the question of elicitation was the nature of the relationship between the civilian caller and the accused.  
     
      
      “Did the state agent exploit any special characteristics of the relationship to extract the statement. Was there a relationship of trust between the state agent and the accused? Was the accused obligated or vulnerable to the state agent? Did the state agent manipulate the accused to bring about a mental state in which the accused was more likely to talk? 
       
       
      In considering whether the statement in question was elicited, evidence of the instructions given to the state agent for the conduct of the conversation may be important.  
      Broyles  
      ante at [39] – [40]. 
      
    Applying the Legal Principles44. As noted earlier, had Dt Wilcox not proposed the idea of phone contact with the accused, I am satisfied no phone call would have occurred between complainant and accused. There is clearly a material difference between the absence of a phone call, and any phone call that takes place. 49. My mind has also been occupied with the speculation of what would have occurred had the Complainant been urged by, say her father, or some other person to make the phone call, and done so. In those circumstances it is likely the phone call that actually occurred would not have differed much from the one that did occur. Nonetheless I regard that as going beyond the first test posed by Iacobucci J. In all the circumstances then it is open to regard the Complainant during this call as being an agent of the state.50. The more difficult question is the one of elucidation. In coming to my view, my last observation, based upon a speculation is of some relevance. While it is true the structure and content of the call was contributed to by Dt Wilcox; the exchange between Complainant and accused could not be characterized as an interrogation such as police would have conducted; her deportment during the conversation would have had the overtones to the accused of someone who felt injured by his prior conduct, but was neither aggressive, offensive or intrusive. She rang assuming the role of a person aggrieved because of past sexual conduct and seeking some explanation for it. Assuming for the purposes of this judgment only that her complaints to police are accurate, the role she adopted during the call was consistent with such a proposition. The accused was at liberty to engage the Complainant on this level, or reject her assertions, or retire from the conversation. There was no badgering, importuning or challenging of him.51. Was the accused obligated or vulnerable to the Complainant? This is not an easy question to address. Assume for the purpose of the judgment the complainant’s allegations were accurate, it may be thought he was vulnerable or felt obliged to her. On the other hand, recognising the status of the plea of “Not Guilty” it cannot be said he was otherwise vulnerable to her. Certainly he professed feelings for her. But that profession of feelings must be understood against the “one night stand” expression of professed feeling for her.52. Nor can it be said there was any manipulation of the accused by the complainant during the telephone conversation. 53. The instructions given by Dt Wilcox to the complainant were loose, non binding and aspirational. The were also of a minimalist nature – address, workplace and if possible the night in question. Details of the address and workplace were not likely to be self-incriminatory. On those instructions the intrusion of the state into the conversation was itself minimal.54. Finally I need to consider the application to exclude the pretext conversation by reliance upon s.138 of the Evidence Act. Frankly, that application must be doomed. The conversation was recorded pursuant to the granting of a listening device warrant. Of course the granting of such a warrant does not constitute an imprimatur to the police decision to conduct a pretext conversation – but it does at least guarantee that the actual recording is permissible. Given that my findings on the question of unfairness as required by s.90 were that there was no unfairness, there is no work for s.138 to do.55. For reasons I have given I reject the application to exclude the pretext conversation of 8th March 2007.

    JUDGMENT1. Mrs RX’s marriage to her husband RX had come under significant strain. In fact she had moved out of home and into a unit. Not only was it under strain but her husband RX had been violent to her a couple of times. She became quite scared and although she had returned to the family home for a meeting she went back to the unit which she was renting in North Parramatta. She felt scared but was, I expect, somewhat reassured by the fact that she was secured in her unit by two doors and three locks. 2. At 7am in the morning on 12 November 2005 RX and his brother MX turned up to her unit. They had a sledge hammer. They beat down both doors. Mrs RX was dragged down the stairs of the block of flats by her husband RX and bundled into MX’s car. MX drove the car to the brothers’ parents place in nearby Guildford. At Guildford, Mrs RX spent the next six or seven hours being kept in detention by her husband RX. 3. Arising from those events RX was charged with the offence of breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a serious indictable offence whilst in company, the offence being taking Mrs RX without her consent and with intent to obtain a psychological advantage. Put in plain terms, that offence is breaking and entering and kidnapping someone whilst the offender was with somebody else helping them. MX was charged with the same offence. Both brothers were also charged with, whilst being in company with each other, detaining Mrs RX without her consent with intent to obtain a psychological advantage. In plain terms that offence is kidnapping. Whilst Mrs RX was being held at Guildford by RX he assaulted her. As a result of that assault he was charged with assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 4. Both men defended these charges and went to trial. On 19 November 2007 a jury found both men guilty of the offences that they were charged with and it is now for me to sentence them. 5. Apart from the usual matters that a judge needs to pay attention to when sentencing offenders there are some particular issues in this case which have arisen and which I will need to make some findings about. One is the psychiatric condition of RX. A second issue is the credibility of MX as a witness including what his role was in the crimes that he was charged with. A third issue is the extent to which the crimes were premeditated or planned. In addition to those three specific issues an important issue in this case - which any judge has to deal with in sentencing - is where the offences lie in the range of objective seriousness. In plain terms that means just how bad these crimes are compared with other crimes of a similar type. 6. It is important to note the penalties which attach to these crimes. The first thing that I should do is to convict both MX and RX of the offence of aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence. That offence is created by s 112(2) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. In addition to that, Parliament regards the offence as so serious that it has attached a standard non-parole period of five years to that offence.7. Moving to the kidnapping offence, I formally convict MX and RX of the offence of aggravated detention of Mrs RX without her consent with intent to obtain psychological advantage, in other words the kidnapping offence. Parliament has fixed a maximum penalty to that as well of twenty years imprisonment. 8. Finally I formally convict RX of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Mrs RX. Parliament has fixed a maximum of five years imprisonment for that offence.9. I propose to make my finding regarding the credibility of MX first because that will affect findings which I make on some of the other issues. The Crown Prosecutor, Ms Herbert, who appeared for the prosecution both at the trial and on sentence, argues that I should reject MX as a witness of truth. She points to the contradiction between MX’s evidence concerning phone calls during the night and the record of phone calls which comprise exhibit T and to the conflict between MX’s account of his involvement in the events and accounts given by witnesses called at the trial. Mr Korn, who appeared in the sentence proceedings for MX but not at the trial, argued that when the evidence of the eye witnesses was compared to his client’s evidence there was not much difference between them. He also argued that the evidence of the telephone calls was consistent with his client’s account. 10. I find that MX is not telling he truth so far as his account of what happened may clash with the account given by other witnesses or documents. In particular I find that, because his evidence before me in the sentence proceedings was that he could not recall most of the telephone calls which are recorded in exhibit T. Exhibit T records communication between a phone possessed by RX and a phone possessed by MX. It picks up communication between those two phones between about 11.45pm the night before the offence and 6.47am on the morning of the offence, about ten minutes before it occurred. After a call of under thirty seconds duration at 11.45pm there was a call at 1.15am of some four minutes. That is followed by calls from MX’s phone to his brother’s phone at various times during the night, namely 3.36am, 3.52am, 4.13am, 4.19am and 4.24am. There follow other calls before 5am from RX’s phone and other calls after 5am and between 7am between the two brothers. 11. MX has no explanation for those calls. He said in fact in answer to a question by me on 31 October 2008 “I don’t recall talking to my brother this many times.” He made it clear that he did not deny it but he said that he simply did not recall speaking to him that many times. In my opinion the evidence is clear from exhibit T that the brothers were in regular communication with each other during the night and up until the time that they attended Mrs RX’s unit. I do not believe that MX cannot remember any of those calls on that night. 12. Insofar as his account of what happened at the scene of the unit and outside the block of units is concerned MX was cross-examined by the Crown Prosecutor on the evidence which was given by other witnesses. He said for example on 31 October 2008 that he did not touch the door of the unit. The account given by a neighbour, W1, that she saw one man banging on the door and the other trying to push the door down, was responded to by MX by saying that he did not hit any door or break any door. When it was specifically put to her that W1 was wrong when she described the two men doing things to the door to be able to open the door, he said “Absolutely”. The witness also described the two men as entering the unit. MX has responded by saying he did not step a foot into that unit. That was in contrast to the evidence of Mrs RX and of W1. 13. The witness also described Mrs RX as being dragged down the stairs. MX said the holding of Mrs RX by her husband RX was more like a hug. One witness said that the men were telling Mrs RX to shut up and be quiet. MX said that he was “absolutely not” saying those words. One witness said that she heard a person who is clearly MX saying to Mrs RX as she was being put into the car “That will fucking teach you”. He denied that. 14. MX in addition has admitted to lying to the police. He was interviewed by the police not long after Mrs RX and her husband were delivered to the house in Guildford. He did not give them any information about what had happened. In fact he lied to the police and admitted that in evidence on 31 October 2008. 15. I repeat, where there is any conflict between evidence given by MX and other witnesses including Mrs RX I do not accept him as a witness of truth. 16. I now need to describe briefly the evidence about what occurred that morning. I rely upon the accounts of the eye witnesses including Mrs RX. As I said, she had been separated from her husband. RX had spent time overseas; he was in Lebanon building a house. On two occasions a few days before these offences Mrs RX was physically assaulted by her husband. She had, as I said, made arrangements to rent a unit. Whilst she was in the unit a day or two before these events she said that her husband had buzzed on the intercom at 6am in the morning and was screaming at her. She was so concerned that she went to the police; she was obviously concerned for her safety. Because of the assaults which had been inflicted upon her and because of his approaches to her in her unit it is not surprising that the unit was secured by two doors and three locks. 17. Her account of what happened on the morning of Saturday 12 November 2005 is that she heard a big noise. She was screaming “Help, help”. RX and MX came inside her unit. She saw her screen door was missing. She said there were three locks on the door. She said RX pulled her by the hair and dragged her down the stairs; she was on her knees. MX opened the back door of the car so that they could sit inside. MX, I add here, denies that but I accept Mrs RX’s account which is corroborated by other witnesses. MX said to her that “we can do whatever we like and no one would know and no one would find us”. RX said that he was not scared of the police. 18. She was driven to Guildford; she knew the place because it belonged to her parents-in-law. MX opened the door and she was taken inside by RX. RX had his hand over her mouth. MX left soon afterwards. She sat in the corner and RX started to kick her; he hit her with his open hand. He was smacking her on the face and pulling her hair. He found an aluminium mop and broke the handle off and hit her over the head. She was feeling a lot of pain; she could not walk or move. He kicked her on the left side around the hip area. She said he broke her ribs; a broken rib was in fact diagnosed by a doctor. She said she still has broken ribs. I make it clear that the diagnosis was one rib, not more than one. 19. She said that when she was being taken from the unit RX said that he wanted to kill her and put her somewhere where no one would know. After MX left he returned and RX asked him to bring food. He returned later with food. There is some question about whether or not MX saw Mrs RX in the condition which resulted from RX assaulting her. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that he was aware of the extent of the injuries inflicted upon her by her husband at the house in Guildford. 20. W1 lived in the same block of units as Mrs RX. She woke up to loud banging; she looked through the peep hole and she saw two men, one with an axe. He was banging on the door. She phoned triple 0. She kept looking through the peep hole and of the two men one was banging on the door and the other was trying to push the door down. It took a few hits and then she said they went in. It was quiet for a while. They had run inside, then they came out holding the lady, as she said, dragging her. One was holding the axe and the other was carrying her. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt - in accepting Mr Korn’s submission - that MX inflicted any physical violence or physical contact on Mrs RX. W1 described – and what I find was - RX with his hand around his wife pulling her down, dragging her down the stairs and out the front. The witness could hear her screaming and the man telling her to shut up. In fact she, when questioned specifically, said both men were using the words “shut up”. Her evidence is graphically and chillingly corroborated by a recording which was admitted into evidence in the trial of the triple 0 call which she made to the police. In the background of the conversation between her and the operator are the distressed screams of a woman. 21. Another witness was W2. She lived in a nearby block of units directly next door to Mrs RX’s block of units. W2’s bedroom and back balcony face the entrance of Mrs RX’s unit. The first thing she recalled was hearing a large banging which woke her up, she thought it was someone doing some renovations; it was 7am. The banging continued for a while and then she heard a woman screaming and she got out of the bed and went onto the balcony to see what was going on. She saw the woman being carried down, the woman was kicking and screaming and trying to get away from the men. One man was carrying the sledgehammer and the other was carrying the woman around the middle and around her neck. I am satisfied that it was MX carrying the sledgehammer and RX carrying Mrs RX. She was kicking and screaming and trying to get away. 22. The man with the sledgehammer, namely MX, opened the back door of the car; they pushed the woman in. RX got in after her. MX walked around and got into the driver’s seat throwing the sledgehammer onto the passenger seat. It is this witness that says that she heard the guy with the sledgehammer - who I am satisfied is MX - when he closed the car door saying “That will fucking teach you”. The witness remembered that specifically because it made her think maybe there was some infidelity on the part of the woman which had provoked this extreme reaction; that was what she said. She described the tone of the voice as sounding pretty aggressive. 23. Another witness, W3, saw the woman being brought from the units and bundled into the car and driven off. She said the woman was screaming at the top of her voice, really high. She also confirmed that one of the men opened the door and the other man pushed the woman into the back seat and I am satisfied that it was MX who opened the door. He denies that and that is another reason for not accepting him. The woman was fighting and trying to get away and the man was trying to cover her mouth with his hand. 24. I have already described Mrs RX’s account of what happened at the unit, in the car and at Guildford. The events concluded because at some time after three in the afternoon at Guildford RX had fallen asleep and Mrs RX took the opportunity to leave the house and alert a neighbour who called the police. The police attended half an hour or so later and RX was arrested. He said that he was due to meet his brother back at the Guildford house at about six that evening. MX turned up around about that time and he was arrested as well.25. I turn now to two of the issues which I mentioned at the commencement. The first can be dealt with fairly quickly and that is the premeditation or planning. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that this crime, committed by both the brothers, was attended by a degree of premeditation. I reject the account given by MX that all he was doing was meeting his brother at his sister-in-law’s unit so that he could give him a lift home. In my opinion, the evidence of the telephone correspondence between them overnight clearly suggests that both men turning up at Mrs RX’s unit at 7am in the morning, armed with a sledgehammer, was the result of whatever was discussed in those phone calls. I accept that RX was obviously the initiator of the crimes but there was some degree of premeditation and planning extending to some hours before it occurred. 26. The second issue which I mentioned at the commencement of these reasons was RX’s psychiatric condition. This is a matter of some controversy. Mr Brady who appears for RX in the sentence proceedings, but not in the trial, urges me to find that he was affected by a psychiatric condition at the time of the offences and remains so. 27. There is a good deal of psychiatric and psychological evidence about RX. Part of the reason is that he was examined for the purposes of assessing whether he was fit for trial. In 2010 (as said) he was assessed for that purpose by Dr Westmore and Dr Nielssen, both experienced forensic psychiatrists. Dr Westmore was not able to reach a definite conclusion. He said it was unclear whether the way that RX presented was affected by psychological or psychiatric factors or by cultural factors. Dr Nielssen’s conservative approach was that he said he could not diagnose any psychiatric disorder without a proper and extensive history.28. A psychologist, Professor Stephen Woods, provided a report dated 29 July 2008. Professor Woods concluded that RX was very probably suffering from a mental illness. He offered a preliminary diagnosis of delusional disorder of the persecutory type. However, he immediately qualified his opinions, referring to it as a preliminary diagnosis. He drew the attention of any reader of his report to the fact that he had seen RX on only one occasion in less than ideal conditions and had limited background documentation to assist with his assessment. 29. The only other medical documentation was a report by Dr Allnutt that at 12 December 2007, he did not have access to Dr Westmore’s report. Dr Allnutt’s report was in fact in evidence before me and Dr Allnutt was unable to provide a firm conclusion about RX. 30. The medical professional who has had most to do with RX is Dr Sinclair, a psychiatrist employed by Justice Health. She examined RX whilst he was in custody after being bail refused following his conviction. Her first examination was 15 August 2008. She reported a few days later, on 22 August 2008, and expressed the opinion that “RX is suffering from a delusional disorder or paranoid schizophrenia. However, the possibility of a paranoid personality disorder on the background of a previous psychotic episode also exists.”31. Dr Sinclair organised a transfer of RX to the Mental Health Screening Unit in the corrective system. She did that because she had “concerns that he definitely needs a more comprehensive, intensive assessment and ongoing mental state examinations because of the nature of his presenting symptoms.” She thought that assessment at the MHSU would clarify the diagnoses because he had various diagnoses. 32. Dr Sinclair produced a further report, dated 30 October 2008. That report followed RX’s time in the Mental Health Screening Unit. Dr Sinclair concluded in that report as follows: 
     
      
      “ 
      In summary, after extensive review, by multiple consultant psychiatrists and a clinical psychologist, re-review and in-patient comprehensive screening assessment at the Mental Health Screening Unit, I am of the opinion that RX does not suffer from a major mental illness. There is no evidence now to suggest that he has a paranoid schizophrenia, a delusional disorder, or an ongoing psychotic process. I do believe, however, that he has strong narcissistic traits.”  
      
    She expressed confidence that he did not require ongoing medication. Asked about his condition at the time of the offences she said that “with regard to the alleged offences there is no evidence to suggest RX was psychotic or suffering from any other major mental illness at that time. His actions may be related to his narcissism and cultural background.”33. When that report was received and went into evidence understandably Mr Brady wanted to cross-examine Dr Sinclair about what Mr Brady described as a “180 degree turn” in her opinion. She was examined and cross-examined before me on 12 December 2008. She had produced a further report the previous day. She said in that report that since her last report in October she requested a subsequent independent forensic psychiatric assessment by a senior forensic psychiatrist. That apparently occurred under the Senior Forensic Psychiatrist and Community Correctional Mental Health Services and Projects Manager on 20 November 2008. Dr Sinclair concluded in that report as follows:  
     
      
      “Cultural issues, personality factors and marital conflict appear to underlie the events, which led to these charges. Apparently, there is no overt evidence of mental illness and certainly fitness does not appear to be in question 
      .” 
      
    She expressed the overall opinion that RX “displays paranoid personality traits and exaggerated cultural factors.”34. In examination-in-chief on 12 December 2008, Dr Sinclair said that the time in the Mental Health Screening Unit provided an opportunity for what she described as a longitudinal assessment. In other words, RX was seen on a day to day basis, being observed whilst he slept and ate, as well as being observed during daily interactions. Asked about her description of him displaying paranoid personality traits and exaggerated cultural factors she said that they were descriptions of his personality and not a diagnosis of psychiatric pathology.35. Mr Brady suggested to her that a limited number of people in the community have such traits. Dr Sinclair acknowledged that she was not familiar with the epidemiology of these particular features but said that he had those features a little more intensely than a majority of people in the community. She confirmed that he was not delusional. She acknowledged that his condition affects how he perceives things but confirmed that it was not a psychiatric diagnosis. She agreed that he had the personality structure which she described at the time of the offences. She was challenged about some behaviours which led to her previous diagnosis of psychiatric pathology. Examples were Mr RX thinking that there were people behind the walls in the court room and an ability to heal pathology in his own body. Dr Sinclair said that during the long assessment in the MHSU there was no evidence of any delusional behaviour. When asked whether there must have been some delusional aspects about his behaviour she said that he has a tendency to say outrageous things and is quite engaging and entitled and says what she described as random things. She said that if the kinds of beliefs, drawn to her attention, were fixed and persisting then they may have been delusional but that there was no evidence in the time in the MHSU of such persistence. There was, she repeated, no evidence of any delusional or thought disorder when he was examined. She said he was aggrieved but not delusional. A delusion she said is something which is usually false and fixed and pervasive. It occupies people’s lives and they spend a lot of time expressing it.36. As I said, Mr Brady in his submissions focused on the turn around in Dr Sinclair’s opinion. He focused on an argument that there was insufficient evidence of a change in the behaviours upon which that diagnosis was based. I do not accept his arguments. I can understand Dr Sinclair’s position. As I said, RX has had a good deal of contact with the medical profession and psychiatrists. Diagnoses were historically unclear or hesitant. Dr Sinclair has had the most experience with RX. In addition, she has arranged for an intensive examination of him over a period of time in the Mental Health Screening Unit. She has reviewed earlier psychiatric reports and has reviewed the information available from the assessment unit. It was, I find, a most comprehensive assessment. For those reasons, I place a good deal of weight on Dr Sinclair’s opinions and I accept her conclusions which I have already referred to.37. I turn now to the findings which I need to make regarding the objective seriousness of these offences. I deal first with the offence of breaking and entering and committing the serious indictable offence, committed by both men. The following I find are aggravating features of that crime which increases its objective seriousness. 38. Primarily, the crime was committed when one of the men was armed with an offensive weapon. That weapon was used with shocking violence and significant force. The weapon was used to get access to the unit through two doors and three locks. There is no evidence that weapon was used to threaten Mrs RX, nor is there evidence that the weapon was taken inside the house but this is not a case where somebody has opened a closed door or even forced a lock or even shouldered a door or broken glass to get in through a window.39. The evidence from the eye witnesses who heard the banging clearly demonstrates the force that was being used on the door with the sledge hammer. The evidence of the triple 0 call graphically illustrates the terror which Mrs RX must have been experiencing. 40. I do not regard it as particularly important which man was using the sledge hammer. Both men were there at the door and I accept the eye witness that one man was using the sledge hammer and the other forcing the door. They were clearly both intent on getting into the unit, both doing their own part to achieve that purpose. 41. Secondly, I accept that there was a degree of premeditation or planning to the extent that I have already described. 42. Insofar as the offence is already an aggravated offence, the aggravation which is pleaded is the fact that the two men were in company with each other. I do not take that into account as a separate aggravating feature because it is part of the crime. But it is important to observe that the circumstance was that there were two men and one woman and that the men were related to the woman, one married to her and the other a brother-in-law. They were men who were part of the victim’s family and whom she might have thought she could trust.43. Next, RX used corporal violence on Mrs RX. He dragged her down the stairs on her knees by her hair. The corporal violence was brutal. MX was not directly responsible for that, nevertheless he was present whilst it was occurring. But he was not the initiator or the perpetrator. 44. Next the crime was attended by the infliction of actual bodily harm on Mrs RX. Once again that was inflicted by RX and not by MX.45. I do not take into account that the offence was aggravated by the knowledge that a person was in the unit because clearly that was an element of the offence since the intention in going into the unit was to kidnap Mrs RX. The authority of Regina v O’Donoghue [2005] 151 A Crim R 597 does not assist me in taking it into account as an additional aggravating feature because that applies to a criminal trial rather than sentencing proceedings.46. Next, the serious indictable offence committed by the two men was itself relatively serious. It was of course not the most serious kind of offence which might have been committed inside but it was significantly more serious than an offence of, for example, stealing which would be at the bottom of the range of the kinds of offences which can be a component of this crime. The definition of a serious indictable offence requires it to have a penalty of at least five years. This crime had twenty years attached to it. As I said, I regard RX as the initiator of this crime and the person more culpable than his brother. Nevertheless, his brother was not only present at the crime but actively assisting both physically in getting into the unit and driving the car and opening and closing the door of the car and in the aggressive words which he used. He was very much a participant in this crime.47. I have no doubt and I am comfortably satisfied that this crime falls in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of this kind. Indeed it is towards the upper end of that middle range. 48 [I also take into account the injury -? sic] In assessing the consequence of that finding so far as the standard non-parole period is concerned I turn to s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and refer to any matters which I have not yet touched upon. I do not take into account as an aggravating feature s 21A(2)(eb) that the offence was committed in the home of the victim because that provision was not in existence at the time of the trial or of the offence, I should say. 49. However, I am of the opinion that the emotional harm caused by the offence was substantial. I am of that opinion based upon the victim impact statement of Mrs RX which has been tendered in evidence. Amongst the things which she says in an extensive victim impact statement which has been appropriately edited, are that she thought she was safe with the security locks and screen door and was so shocked when the men entered. She thought she was going to die. She thought her husband was going to kill her and that she would not see her children again. She feels as though she is a prisoner in her own home due to the effects of this violent crime. She says she has long lasting effects from the kidnapping and the act of violence. She has extreme fear of RX, frequent nightmares, frequent flashbacks, insomnia for two years, recurring thoughts about violence and avoidance of places where RX and his family might be. She has very high levels of stress, panic attacks, agitation, exaggerated startle response, depression and grief and loss about her children. She is seeing a psychologist. She is always looking over her family. She said that she is living in dreadful fear on a daily basis and that everyday is an effort to live her life and she is in a constant nightmare. 50. None of this is surprising. Obviously some of those reactions are specifically to the violence of the events of the men entering her unit and others might be more closely connected with the kidnapping or the detention or the violence inflicted by RX at the Guildford house but I am satisfied in relation to the primary crime of breaking and entering and committing a serious indictable offence that the victim Mrs MX has suffered substantial emotional harm.51. I turn to any mitigating factors which might bring this crime - so far as either offender is concerned - away from attracting the standard non-parole period. 52. Neither man has any significant record of previous convictions. That is a factor to which there should be some weight given. MX has a reasonable a number of convictions but they are mostly related to traffic. 53. I take into account that both men are highly regarded within their families and within their community and as working men. These point to men who are entitled to rely to some extent or to the full extent on their good character. 54. I think MX is unlikely to re-offend. I am not so confident about RX because of the descriptions given about him by the medical practitioners. 55. Neither man has a strong claim to remorse. RX continues to deny the offences. MX denied any involvement at the trial but admitted his involvement in the sentence proceedings. But his admissions were in a way which minimised his own involvement. I do not find that he has significant remorse about this offence. 56. So far as MX is concerned, there are issues concerning the fact that he is looking after his elderly parents as well as having a role in minding his own children as well as the children of his brother, RX. His absence from that family situation will obviously cause some degree of hardship, perhaps significant on all of those people. I have considered the evidence which has been led in that regard. He obviously does play an important role in the lives of these people. However, both brothers come from a large family. Some of the children are in their late teens and early adulthood. The authorities make it clear that hardship is brought about not by the sentence imposed by the judge but by the choice which the offender made in committing the crimes. It is only in the most exceptional cases that hardship on persons other than the offender might result in a reduction in the sentence. Those extraordinary circumstances in my opinion do not exist in this case.57. There is some suggestion that MX was under the influence of his older brother. MX is the youngest of eight children. RX is the middle child. I do not place any weight on that. MX has turned thirty this year. He has been an adult for over twelve years. It is no excuse for him that his role in this serious crime was in some way influenced by his older brother. It may well have been influenced, but his status as an adult and his maturity and role as a husband and father himself clearly put him in a position where he could choose not to participate or to stop his brother from doing it.58. So far as the good character of RX is concerned, I must take into account that he had committed acts of domestic violence upon his wife in the few days before the offence. I accept Mr Brady’s submission that up until then, his good character was significant. 59. Because this crime is as objectively serious as it is and because it has the number of aggravating features that it does, I am not convinced that the standard non-parole period should not apply. In the words of s 54B “the court is to set the standard non-parole period unless I determine that there are reasons for setting a non-parole period that is longer or shorter than the standard non-parole period.” This is clearly an offence which is, as I say, in the upper echelons of the middle of the range of objective seriousness and it is so serious that none of the factors in s 21A (3) which I have referred to result, in my opinion, in the standard non-parole period not applying and that applies in respect of both offenders.60. Insofar as count two is concerned, the kidnapping lasted some eight hours from about seven in the morning until after three in the afternoon. I take into account that it was not a period of days or which some kidnapping crimes can involve. Nevertheless, it was not temporary for half an hour or so. It involved a journey in the car and detention in the house as well. RX was primarily responsible for this detention and was the person who was present all the time. Nevertheless, MX failed to take the opportunity to alert the police to the fact that his sister-in-law had been kidnapped by his brother. But his role in the detention of Mrs RX was less serious than his brothers.61. The offence in my opinion - so far as RX was concerned - was in the lower end of the middle of the range of objective seriousness and - so far as MX was concerned - was at the lower end of the range of objective seriousness. 62. As for the offence of inflicting actual bodily harm committed by RX on his wife, this was aggravated, I accept, by the use of the mop handle. The injuries were serious and the bruises were extensive and it involved a broken rib. 63. All of these crimes - I need to bear in mind as an important sentencing principle - were committed in the context of domestic violence. I accept that it was RX who is the husband of the victim and the person primarily responsible for the domestic violence. It was also he who had the history of some domestic violence with his wife, although short.64. The Court of Criminal Appeal in this State has made clear what its attitude is to sentencing offenders in respect of crimes involving domestic violence. In Regina v Hamid [2006] NSWCCA 302, the court referred to a previous decision of the court in Regina v Glenn (CCA, unreported 19 December 1994) and quoted Simpson J as saying that the victims of domestic violence will “receive the full protection of the law, insofar as the courts are able to afford it to them.” Hamid also referred to a judgment in Regina v Fahda [1999] NSWCCA 267 in which, once again, Simpson J said: 
     
      
      “ 
      Domestic violence is a problem of considerable proportions in this community and the courts must be strong to ensure that it is adequately punished.” 
       
      
    In Hamid, the court also referred to the judgment of the Chief Judge at Common Law, with Stoddard and Bell JJ agreeing, in Regina v Edigarov (2001) 125 A Crim R 551. In that case, his Honour said:  
     
      
      “In truth, such conduct is brutal, cowardly and inexcusable, and the Courts have a duty to ensure that it is adequately punished, and that sentences are handed out which have a strong element of personal and general deterrence.” 
       
      
    Finally, the Court referred to its judgment in Regina v Dunn (2004) 144 A Crim R 180, where the Court said that domestic violence crimes are differentiated from many other crimes of violence first because the offender usually believes in a real sense that what they do is justified and secondly because the continued estrangement between the parties requires continued threat. The Court said that the victim never feels truly safe. The Court said in Dunn that “these considerations emphasise not only the need for general and personal deterrence but also of denunciation in cases of this kind.”65. There is evidence in this case that RX regarded the violence which he had inflicted upon his wife when she was in detention at Guildford as justified. He made a remark to that effect to one of the police officers who attended the scene. Obviously from the evidence of what occurred at the unit including what he said to his wife, he believed that what he did was justified.66. Mrs RX’s victim impact statement points clearly to her feeling never safe. Those principles must guide me in fixing the sentences which I am now about to fix. I have taken into account the principles of concurrency and the extent to which the sentences need to be partly concurrent and those principles will be reflected in the sentences which I impose.67. RX, if you would stand up? For the offence of aggravated break and enter and commit a serious indictable offence, I set a non-parole period of six years to date from 19 November 2007 and to expire on 18 November 2013. The balance of the term is six years from 19 November 2013 expiring on 18 November 2019. I accept that there are special circumstances for the balance of the term exceeding one third of the non-parole period namely, that this is your first time in custody. 68. For the kidnapping offence, I set a non-parole period of four years, to commence on 19 May 2010 and to expire on 18 May 2014. The balance of the term will be three years from 19 May 2014 to 18 May 2017. 69. For the assault occasioning actual bodily harm, I set a non-parole period of two years from 19 November 2012 to 18 November 2014. The balance of the term will be one year from 19 November 2014 expiring on 18 November 2015. The earliest date on which, on the information available to me, you will be eligible for parole is 18 November 2014. 70. Now MX, if you would stand up? For the break and enter and commit serious indictable offence, I set a non-parole period of five years to commence today, 19 December 2008 and to conclude on 18 December 2013. The balance of the term will be four years from 19 December 2013 to 18 December 2017. 71. For the kidnapping, I take into account that you have served custody of some four months and four days relating to this matter and I sentence you to a fixed period of four and-a-half months(as said) to commence on 19 August 2009 and to expire on 18 February 2014. The earliest date on which it appears to me that you will be eligible for parole is 18 February 2014. HIS HONOUR: All right, now what I propose to do now is to adjourn for a quick morning tea whilst you, the parties, look at the figures and any other orders that I need to make and I will come back in about ten or fifteen minutes.SHORT ADJOURNMENTHIS HONOUR: Okay, the matters of RX and MX. My associate has drawn my attention and one correction that I need to make is I think I imposed a sentence of four and-a-half months instead of four and-a-half years, although I probably articulated the - is that what you were going to say, Ms Herbert?HERBERT: That was one of the things I was going to say, yes.72. Let me immediately say, MX for the kidnapping offence, your sentence is four and-a-half years from 19 August 2009 to 18 February 2014. All right, now what else?HERBERT: There’s nothing the Crown’s raising in relation to sentences your Honour. However in relation to RX, under the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007--HIS HONOUR: Volume?HERBERT: I’ve got it in my volume, court volume, your Honour it’d be just after the Crimes Act, so it should be volume 1.HIS HONOUR: Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007?HERBERT: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Yes, what do you want to draw to my attention?HERBERT: There’s a mandatory apprehended violence order to be made under s 39. That says if a person pleads guilty or is found guilty of an offence of a domestic violence offence.HIS HONOUR: All right, now this is obviously a domestic violence offence but where is that--HERBERT: Going back, section 4 of the Act defines what a personal violence offence is which includes an offence on section 86. It’s a domestic relationship because they were married at the time and those are the definitions relevant to section 11. So domestic violence offence is a personal violence offence committed by a person in a domestic relationship. HIS HONOUR: And this offence is section 112--HERBERT: 112 does not come within that but section 86.HIS HONOUR: Right, 86. HERBERT: And section 59, both are personal violence offences.HIS HONOUR: 86. Sorry, section 86 is the rules.HERBERT: No, section 86 of the Crimes Act being the detain for advantage.HIS HONOUR: All right.HERBERT: That’s a personal violence offence as is assault occasioning actual bodily harm.HIS HONOUR: Yes, I see what you mean, yes. I see, because break, enter and steal may not necessarily - it just happens to be these offences, yes, yes, as I understand.All right. So I am satisfied that it’s according to section 11, it’s domestic violence offence so I go to section 39, do I?HERBERT: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: So RX has been found guilty of domestic violence offence. Now I must make an apprehended violence order. What are the terms of that order or where do I find that?HERBERT: Your Honour, I’ve got the standard form which includes the mandatory orders. If I can hand up a copy?HIS HONOUR: Right. Where does that come from, rules or regulations?HERBERT: The mandatory provisions, section 35 of the Act.HIS HONOUR: So what are the terms of the order which you’re asking me to make?HERBERT: The terms of the order I’m seeking your Honour are the mandatory orders which on that form are 1A, B and C.HIS HONOUR: Yes?HERBERT: And I’d suggest an additional order, 3. Your Honour, the question of duration of that--HIS HONOUR: Yes, because he’s in gaol until--HERBERT: Since he’s in gaol, section 79 of the Act, basically there is not a limit as to the duration of an apprehended violence order.HIS HONOUR: All right. So what do you propose?HERBERT: So I’d invite your Honour to consider an order that would continue for five years post release which would be an order up to the 18th of November 2019.HIS HONOUR: Okay, anything else?HERBERT: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Mr Brady?BRADY: Your Honour has to make the order, how long it’s made for is a matter for your Honour.73. Under s 39 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007, I make an apprehended violence order for the protection of Mrs RX. The order is made against RX. The order is in the following terms:  
     
      
      (a) RX must not assault, molest, harass, threaten or otherwise interfere with Mrs RX or a person with whom Mrs RX has a domestic relationship; 
       
       
      (b) RX must not engage in any other conduct that intimidates Mrs RX or a person with whom she may have a domestic relationship; 
       
       
      (c) RX must not stalk Mrs RX or a person with whom she may have a domestic relationship; 
       
       
      (d) RX must not enter any premises at which Mrs RX may, from time to time reside or work.” 
       
      
    It says already other specified premises but I am not specifying any.HERBERT: No, no, it’s specified--HIS HONOUR: All right. No other orders sought or conditions or orders of--HERBERT: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Okay. Ms Herbert, we will mark that for identification, whatever number we’re up to, that formal order. HERBERT: Sorry, did your Honour set an expiry date for the order?HIS HONOUR: No, I didn’t. Thank you.74. The terms of the order are to commence on 19 November 2014 and to expire on 18 November 2019.HERBERT: I don't know if you can put in a future date.BRADY: From today and to expire on 18 November 2019, your Honour should--HIS HONOUR: Say that again?BRADY: From today, your Honour makes the order and you just give an expiry date.HIS HONOUR: I make the order but - I see. That’s the problem whether I can--BRADY: Make a future order.HIS HONOUR: I see. BRADY: Sorry, a future starting date.HIS HONOUR: I see the point, yes.74. The order is to date from today and to expire on 18 November 2019.BRADY: Thank you, your Honour.HERBERT: Thanks your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Ms Herbert, anything else?HERBERT: Nothing else, thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right. Mr Brady, any corrections or issues, legal issues so far as the sentence is concerned?BRADY: No, your Honour. No.HIS HONOUR: And Ms Macdougall, insofar as MX, is there any legal issues to do with the sentence?MACDOUGALL: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: No. Okay, both offenders may be taken down.ADJOURNED

     JUDGMENT 
    1 The offender is before this Court as a result of being charged with the offence of Driving with the Middle Range Prescribed Concentration of Alcohol. This is an offence contrary to the provisions of Section 9(3) of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic) Management Act 1999. Such an offence is defined in Section 3 of the Road Transport (General) Act 1999 as a ‘Major Offence’. The penalty provisions set out in that Act provide for a maximum penalty of 12 months imprisonment, and/or a fine of $3300. The offence is also one to which, upon conviction, a statutory regime of disqualification of license applies. 2 In the case of this offender it is relevant to note that 14th September 2004 he was convicted of the offence of Driving with the Low Range Prescribed Concentration of Alcohol. On that occasion the offender was fined $500 and as a consequence of conviction, disqualified from holding or obtaining any license for the statutory minimum period of 3 months. The relationship between that conviction and this offence is such that in addition to the penalty regime provided for a second offender as referred to above, he is liable to disqualification for an automatic period of 3 years or a minimum period of 12 months. 3 I have set out this part of the offender’s history at some length. The reason is readily apparent to counsel for the offender. At the time he committed the offence on 25th April 2009 the offender was subject to the supervision of the Court. On 26th June 2008 he had been convicted of the offence of common assault. For that offence, pursuant to the provisions of Section 9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 he was released on a good behaviour bond. The bond was imposed for a period of two years and was made subject to supervision by the Probation and Parole Service and to participation in appropriate drug and alcohol rehabilitation programmes. 4 On the same date the offender was sentenced to a period of imprisonment for 10 months for an offence contrary to the provisions of Section 13 of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) 2007. In the exercise of its discretion the Court suspended the execution of the sentence pursuant to the provisions of Section 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The offender was placed on a bond subject to the same terms and conditions to those that were made a condition of the bond pursuant to Section 9. The duration of the bond was the same length as the period of imprisonment – 10 months. It was due to expire at midnight on 25th April 2009. I will deal with the breach of the bond ordered pursuant to Section 9 separately. My remarks at this stage are confined to the consequences of the offender being in breach of a bond ordered pursuant to Section 12 of the Act. To begin this task I turn to the offence that gave rise to a breach of the respective bonds. 5 On the afternoon of 25th April 2009 the offender was arrested and charged with the offence of driving with the middle range prescribed concentration of alcohol. He has entered a plea of guilty to that charge. This has consequences relative to the bond imposed pursuant to Section 9 and to the sentence pursuant to Section 12 of the Act.6 Although the period of supervision and requirement for good behaviour required in relation to the Section 12 bond has now expired the provisions of Section 100 of the Act apply. Revocation of the bond is within the power of the Court. The offence committed by the offender took place some 8 hours and 3 minutes before the bond under Section 12 would have expired. As a consequence the Court must turn its mind to the provisions of Section 98 of the Act and Section 98(3) in particular. This provision is expressed in the following terms: 
     
      
       “98(3) In the case of a good behaviour bond referred to in Section 12 a court  
      must revoke the bond  
      [my emphasis] unless it is satisfied: 
       
      (a) that the offender’s failure to comply with the conditions of the bond was trivial in nature or; 
       
      (b) that there are good reasons for excusing the offender’s failure to comply with the condition of the bond.” 
       
       
      
    7 Counsel for the offender, correctly in my view, conceded that Section 98(3)(a) has no application in that the offence committed by the offender cannot reasonably be regarded as ‘trivial’. It is the case therefore that unless the Court comes to the view there are good reasons to excuse the failure to comply with the breach within Section 98(3)(b), that the mandatory enforcement provisions apply and the suspended term of imprisonment must be activated. 8 As statements of principle; guidance in the approach to be taken in relation to a breach of a Section 12 bond can be found in the decisions of DPP v Cooke & Anor [2007] NSWCA 2 and DPP v Nouata [2009] NSWSC 72.9 It is clear from the decision in Nouata that the fact that a section 12 bond may be near to expiry is not relevant to the exercise of a discretion pursuant to Section 98(3)(b). The considerations relevant to whether a bond ought be revoked are confined to those set out in Section 98(3)(a) and (b) alone. 10 Having determined that the offence giving rise to the breach cannot be regarded as trivial I turn to the observations made in DPP v Cooke & Anor. At [14] in the leading judgment in Cooke Howie J. observed: 
     
      
      “what the court is required to consider is whether there are good reasons to excuse the failure to comply with the condition of the bond in circumstances where that failure is not trivial in nature. The focus must principally be upon the behaviour giving rise to the failure to comply with the conditions of the bond and whether that behaviour should be excused.” 
       
      
    11 And further at [15] by way of elucidation the Court said, inter alia, that 
     
      
       “the subjective circumstances of an offender at the time of proceedings for revocation of the bond are irrelevant to a determination under Section 98(3)(b).” 
      
    12 The Court was however mindful that there may be  
     
      
      “extenuating circumstances of  
      sufficient importance  
      [my emphasis] to explain the behaviour giving rise to the breach (such that) the court can exercise its discretion to take no action on the breach”. Howie J. goes on to identify examples that might lead to such a conclusion highlighting that “if the breach is a further offence the failure to be of good behaviour might be excused because of extenuating circumstances leading to the offending behaviour.”  
      
    13 Ironically, given that the offence giving rise to the breach in this matter is a drink driving offence Howie J. gives an example of drink driving in an emergency situation as being such an example where the breach might be excused. Lest the offender take comfort in his Honour’s observations he should understand that they did not stop at this point and in any event the offender’s decision to take over the driving from his wife such as to lead to the commission of the offence establishing the breach could not in any way be regarded as a decision made in response to an emergency.14 In referring to the observations made by Hidden J in DPP v Burrow [2004] NSWSC 433 the court expressed the view that a breach occasioned by further offending requires the court to focus on the circumstances of that offence [24] and where the offence is relatively minor to weigh its gravity against the consequences of revocation of the bond particularly where the suspended sentence is a long one [25].15 The decision in Burrow goes on to refer to the decision in R v Marston (1993) 60 SASR 320 before distinguishing the issues the court had to determine in that matter and the legislation governing suspended sentences in South Australia from the circumstances that apply in New South Wales before stating clearly and unequivocally [21] that the principal consideration, if not the only one is upon the conduct giving rise to the breach. Such a consideration ought not occur in a vacuum.16 Howie J. went on to endorse the comments made in Marston [22] and stated that:   
     
      
      There is nothing more likely to bring suspended sentences into disrepute than the failure of the courts to act where there has been a clear breach of the conditions of the bond by which the offender avoided being sent to prison…..if offenders do not treat the obligations imposed upon them by the bond seriously and if the courts are not rigorous in revoking the bond upon breach in the usual case, both the offenders and the public in general will treat them as being nothing more than a legal fiction designed to allow an offender to escape the punishment that he or she rightly deserved.” 
       
      
    17 And further at [26]: 
     
      
      … the sentence to be imposed for the offence giving rise to the breach cannot be taken into account in determining whether to revoke the bond. The penalty to be imposed for the offending behaviour is simply irrelevant to the determination of whether good reasons exist to excuse the breach. 
      
    18 I have set out the reasoning in Cooke at some length because it is important for the offender to know the basis upon which the court is required to consider whether to revoke the bond under Section 12. It should be clear by now that the basis is confined to a consideration of whether there is anything of sufficient persuasiveness in the commission of the offence that gave rise to the breach such that a court may reasonably conclude that there are good reasons for excusing the breach.  19 To consider this question I turn to the factual circumstances to which the plea of guilty was entered. At this stage I make it clear that I do not have regard to the subjective features relevant to the offender. They are relevant on the question of sentence for the offence itself but as the foregoing extracts from superior courts make clear, not on the issue of whether the breach ought be excused. I turn to the circumstances surrounding the commission of the offence.20 Put succinctly, on the afternoon of 25th April 2009 the offender was driving a motor vehicle North along the Lachlan Valley Way near Boorowa. The weather was overcast and the roadway was wet after recent rain. He was stopped for the purpose of a random breath test. The roadside breath test proved positive and he was arrested. Subsequently he was taken to Boorowa Police station where a breath analysis established a reading of .115 grams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood. This is a reading within the middle range prescribed concentration of alcohol. 21 The factual environment is enlivened by background material tendered in his plea in mitigation to the substantive offence. Counsel for the offender tendered, inter alia, a statement from the offender’s wife. Absent any evidence to the contrary that document established that present with the offender in the vehicle was his wife and his two young daughters aged 5 and 3. The document further established that the offender was known to have consumed a quantity of alcohol earlier in the morning before the family set off to drive from Kogarah to Boorowa. It was put to the court that the act of driving by the offender only commenced minutes before being pulled over by police and then only because the offender’s wife felt “a bit ill”. There is no suggestion in the statement that the degree of illness was such that it would have prevented her from completing the journey. In other words any change in the driver was effected as a convenience not in response to an emergency of the type postulated by Howie J in Cooke [supra].22 It is clear from other statements in the document that the offender had consumed a considerable amount of alcohol on the previous night and had added to that consumption earlier in the day. If the statement by his wife is correct some 7 hours elapsed from his last known act of drinking yet he still returned a reading of .115. The reality of offenders being caught by the residual effects of consuming large amounts of alcohol the evening prior to the commission of this type of offence is well known to Courts in this jurisdiction. It does not assist the offender nor in my view does it create an extenuating set of circumstances.23 It may be the case that he only drove at the instance of his wife. That is an explanation not a justification. It is not a matter to be weighed in the balance as a mitigating factor. It cannot be the case that it constitutes an extenuating circumstance. The offence to which the offender pleaded guilty is an offence of strict liability. 24 Having come to the view that there are no extenuating circumstances then the mandatory provisions referred to in Section 98(3) arise for application and in accordance with the provisions of Section 99 of the Act I revoke the bond made pursuant to section 12. The Offender is ordered to serve the period of 10 months imprisonment previously suspended. There is nothing put before this court that persuades me that special circumstances exist pursuant to Section 44 justifying interference with the statutory relationship between the head sentence and the non parole period. The non-parole period is to consist of a period of 7 months 15 days. The balance is to consist of a period of 2 months and 15 days. I have considered whether the term of imprisonment should be served by way of full time custody. In so doing I have come to the conclusion that such an outcome remains the option of last resort to be applied only after the court has rejected the appropriateness of either Periodic Detention or Home Detention. I do not believe that Periodic Detention adequately addresses the seriousness of the offender’s conduct. Nor does such an outcome provide access to the driver rehabilitation and alcohol rehabilitation programmes that the offender clearly needs to address the underlying aspects of causation.25 In light of the offender’s history and seemingly well entrenched issues with alcohol and major traffic offences the subjective circumstances warrant consideration as to whether he is suitable to serve his sentence by way of Home Detention. The proceedings are adjourned until 13th November 2009 to enable an assessment to take place.Graeme HensonChief Magistrate

      JUDGMENT – EX TEMPORE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: These are proceedings commenced by summons filed in court today pursuant to leave granted by me. By its summons, the plaintiff seeks an order pursuant to s 10 of the Criminal Assets Recovery Act 1990 (""the Act"") that no person, other than a person or body having a superior title permitting it to do so, is to dispose of or attempt to dispose of, or otherwise to deal with or attempt otherwise to deal with, an interest in property (within the meaning of that expression as defined in s 7 of the Act) of the defendant. Ancillary orders are also sought. 
     
      
    2 In support of that application, the plaintiff relies upon an affidavit of Jonathan Lee Spark sworn 14 January 2009. It goes without saying that I have read that affidavit. For reasons that will become apparent, it is necessary briefly to refer to the matters to which Mr Spark deposes. 
     
      
    3 Mr Spark says, uncontroversially, that he is employed by the plaintiff as the Assistant Director, Financial Investigations, and is an authorised officer within the meaning of that expression in s 4(1) of the Act. That is to say, Mr Spark is a person authorised in writing by the plaintiff generally to act as an authorised officer for the purposes of s 10.  
     
      
    4 Mr Spark has been a financial investigator with the plaintiff since 1997. In that capacity and presumably during that time he has had access via computers to records held by the New South Wales Police Force and other similar information retrieval systems to which he specifically refers in his affidavit.  
     
      
    5 At paragraph 3 of his affidavit Mr Spark gives evidence in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        ""I suspect that [the defendant] has engaged in a serious crime-related activity or serious crime-related activities (within the meaning of 'serious crime-related activity' as defined in s 6 of the Act), namely, recklessly deal with the proceeds of crime contrary to s 193B (3) of the Crimes Act 1900 being an offence liable to imprisonment for 5 years or more involving money laundering and thereby falling within the definition of 'serious crime-related offence' as defined in s 6(2)(d) of the Act.""  
        
       
      
    6 In the following paragraph Mr Spark then describes the basis upon which he says he holds that suspicion. He said that on 14 January 2009 he contacted Detective Anthony Volpe of the New South Wales Police Force via the New South Wales Police Force's internal telephone system and had a conversation with Detective Volpe in which the latter agreed to send him by facsimile a Facts Sheet relating to the arrest of the defendant. He received that Facts Sheet the same day and a copy of it is annexed to his affidavit. Mr Spark says that he has had regard to it. 
     
      
    7 Mr Spark continues that on the same day he had a telephone conversation with Detective Daniel Condon, during the course of which Detective Condon informed him that he had been involved in the police investigation into the activities of the defendant described in the Facts Sheet and that Detective Condon had himself assisted in drafting it. Mr Spark asked Detective Condon whether or not to the best of his knowledge and belief the contents of the Facts Sheet were true. Mr Spark says that Detective Condon replied that they were. Mr Spark further enquired of Detective Condon whether the Facts Sheet was prepared on the basis of information obtained by police as a result of the investigation that it describes. Detective Condon also replied ""Yes.""  
     
      
    8 Mr Spark deposed to a belief which he holds that Detective Condon's responses to the questions that he asked him, including but not limited to the ones I have set out, were true. 
     
      
    9 Mr Spark also said that on 14 January 2009 he conducted a search of the records of the Computerised Operational Policing System and located a record that revealed that on 9 January 2009 the defendant had been charged with the offences described in the Facts Sheet. Mr Spark annexes a copy of that record to his affidavit. 
     
      
    10 In applying for the orders sought by the plaintiff on an ex parte basis, Mr Singleton of counsel, who appeared for the plaintiff, quite properly drew to my attention a recent decision of Adams J in New South Wales Crime Commission v Vu & Tran (23 December 2008, unreported). Mr Singleton frankly conceded that the facts in that case were, for all relevant purposes but allowing for understandable differences, effectively identical with the facts of the present case. More particularly, the application in that case was made upon the basis of an affidavit sworn by Mr Spark in which he deposed to cognate facts and circumstances in a way not dissimilar to the present case. Adams J in that case rejected the plaintiff's application for an order under s 10 for any relief at all. 
     
      
    11 In proceedings before me, Mr Singleton also conceded that if the decision of Adams J were correct, the present application before me must fail. In aid of a submission that the plaintiff is entitled to the relief which it seeks, however, Mr Singleton contended that the decision of Adams J was plainly wrong and that in those circumstances ought not be followed by me in the present case. 
     
      
    12 For some time prior to the decision in International Finance Trust Company Limited v New South Wales Crime Commission [2008] NSWCA 291, applications of the type with which I am now dealing were customarily heard in chambers and were disposed of without reasons being given. Following that decision, it seems clear that such applications must now be made in open court and that reasons for whatever decision is arrived at must be provided. 
     
      
    13 A significant issue arising in that case was the admissibility of evidence tendered in support of the application for an order under s 10 of the Act. The learned President and her Honour Beazley JA came to the view that the evidence in that case was inadmissible and, accordingly, that the plaintiff was not entitled to the relief that it sought. However, they each expressed the view at pars [51] and [56] respectively that, if they were wrong about the admissibility of the evidence in that case, they agreed with the analysis of the Chief Judge at Common Law and with the conclusions that he reached about the reasonableness of the grounds for suspicion held by the equivalent deponent in that case.  
     
      
    14 The Chief Judge at Common Law discussed the sufficiency of the evidence for the deponent's suspicions at pars [117] and following and expressed his conclusions between pars [132] and [135] inclusive as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        ""[132] There can be no doubt that the matters to which Mr Moerman deposed justify the suspicion which he holds. An arrangement by which invoices are created which are utilised to falsely represent that monies have been paid and a business expense can legitimately be claimed for services which have not been rendered suggests at least to the level of suspicion that relevant offences have been committed.  
         
         
        [133] The only question is whether, when the evidence before the court is confined to a police officer's account of the findings of a police investigation and primary documentary material has not been tendered, the Court may be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for the officer's suspicion. It was submitted by the appellants that unless admissible evidence tending to prove the matters upon which the suspicion was based was tendered the application should be dismissed.  
         
         
        [134] I do not accept the submission. As  
        Rockett  
        makes plain there is a significant difference between legislation which requires a judicial officer to be satisfied of a particular state of facts and legislation which requires a judicial officer to be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for a suspicion held by another. If the judicial officer must be satisfied evidentiary requirements and the obligation to prove matters to the appropriate level will be engaged. When however the judicial officer is called upon to determine whether there are reasonable grounds for another's belief it is necessary to make the relevant determination by examining the matters which that person has considered in forming their belief.  
         
         
        [135] In the present case the foundation for Mr Moerman's belief is the joint investigation. Being an investigation to assist in the enforcement of the law it is appropriate for Mr Moerman to have significant regard to the findings of the investigation. In short it is reasonable for him to rely on those findings in forming his suspicion. It may be that it would have been preferable if his evidence had included a copy of any report, if there be one, of the investigation and that he explicitly deposed to the fact he relied on matters in that report when forming his suspicion. That he has not taken this approach may reflect the fact that no written document exists, although this would be unusual. Although it would be preferable if it had been put into evidence the absence of any written material is not in my opinion fatal to the application. The views expressed by Mr Moerman are plainly his own views formed from his involvement in the investigation of these matters and are no doubt also informed by the views of others. His view is expressed having regard to a body of collected investigative material. When it is appreciated that significant monies are being removed from Australia to New Zealand in response to allegedly false invoices created and then returned a relevant suspicion must be created in the mind of any reasonable person. Because that suspicion is based on the work of the joint investigation it has a substantial foundation and is in my judgment based on reasonable grounds."" 
        
       
      
    15 The plaintiff contends before me that the critical distinction between the present case and the recent decision of Adams J on the one hand and the decision of the Court of Appeal in International Finance (supra) on the other hand is that the decision of the Court of Appeal dealt with evidence contained in an affidavit that was for all relevant intents and purposes wholly, or at least mainly, inadmissible and that the Court of Appeal held that once that material was excluded there was insufficient evidence left to support the suspicions to which the deponent referred. The evidence was excluded by applying the normal rules. 
     
      
    16 The plaintiff contends that, in the proceedings before Adams J and, by analogy, in the proceedings before me, the evidence was and is presently in an admissible form. Mr Singleton has informed me from the Bar table and I accept, as he was counsel for the plaintiff in the proceedings before Adams J, that none of the material in Mr Spark's equivalent affidavit was excluded by his Honour. The plaintiff submits that once Mr Spark's evidence is admitted it becomes clear upon what basis his suspicions are held. The plaintiff contends that all that is required is sufficient evidence reasonably to support that suspicion. In other words, it is unnecessary to prove any facts apart from the fact of receiving the information that induced the formation of a suspicion in the first place. 
     
      
    17 The point upon which the plaintiff presently relies to argue, and hopefully to demonstrate, that the decision of Adams J was wrong is that his Honour appears to have formed the view, and accordingly decided the case upon the basis, that the plaintiff must go as far as to establish by admissible evidence the source of the information otherwise amounting to hearsay evidence. In other words, the plaintiff contends, in contrast to his Honour's view, that the present plaintiff need only establish or prove by admissible evidence how the relevant deponent formed the suspicion that he formed and that it was reasonable for the purposes of s 10 but not that the suspicion is correct. 
     
      
    18 The plaintiff proffers the following analogy. If Mr Spark were to meet and to be told something in the street by, for example, a judge of this Court, that to the knowledge of that judge certain facts and circumstances were true, it would be sufficient for that deponent to rely upon his knowledge of the judge and of his veracity to permit him reasonably to form a suspicion of the matters about which he was required to form such a suspicion. In contrast, a reliance by the deponent upon information given to him by an apparently or probably unreliable stranger otherwise to like effect would not operate in the same way.  
     
      
    19 The plaintiff contends in the circumstances that Adams J, with respect to him, did not have regard to what the President said at par [51] of the International Finance case or what the Chief Judge at Common Law said particularly at par [135].20 In the present case it is accurate to observe that anything told to Mr Spark either by Detective Volpe or Detective Condon was hearsay and otherwise inadmissible to prove the truth of the facts related by them to Mr Spark. However, consistently with the argument that I have attempted previously to summarise, the plaintiff contends that, even though that evidence may be hearsay, the evidence given by Mr Spark about the views he formed, having regard to that evidence conveyed to him by each of those officers, was itself admissible and, accordingly, sufficient to satisfy the opinions expressed by those members of the Court of Appeal in International Finance at the paragraphs to which I have referred.  
     
      
    21 In my opinion, that submission is correct. As the paragraphs from the judgment of the Chief Judge at Common Law in International Finance make clear, the equivalent deponent in that case was entitled to have significant regard to the findings of the police investigation to the details of which he referred. As his Honour said, it was reasonable for the deponent to rely on those findings in forming his suspicion even (I interpolate) if he was not able from his own first-hand knowledge to verify their accuracy. As his Honour indicated, it maybe that it would have been preferable if the deponent's evidence had included additional material. Despite that preference, his Honour indicated that the absence of such material was not, in his opinion, fatal to the application.  
     
      
    22 It seems to me, having regard to the scheme of the Act, that s 10 attracts attention to the matters that the relevant deponent describes as the grounds upon which his or her suspicion is based. There must be reasonable grounds for any such suspicion. It seems to me that, having regard to Mr Spark's experience and his knowledge of the matters to which he refers, and which he describes in an admissible form, there are or were reasonable grounds for him to form the suspicion in the way that he described. 
     
      
    23 Part of the plaintiff's submission before me included a contention respectfully raised for the purpose of advancing its arguments that the view adopted by Adams J was unduly technical. It is both inappropriate and unnecessary for me to express a view about that. Similarly, it is unnecessary for me to express a view about whether or not the decision reached by Adams J in the case before him was wrong.  
     
      
    24 Undoubtedly the plaintiff's submissions before me have been advanced with the benefit of an appreciation of Adams J's decision on the earlier occasion. For my part, with the benefit of those submissions, it seems to me that applying the decision of the Court of Appeal in International Finance Mr Spark's suspicion has been based on reasonable grounds and that there is admissible evidence of that fact. 
     
      
    25 Counsel for the plaintiff has provided me with a draft form of the orders which are sought by the plaintiff. Accordingly, upon the plaintiff by its counsel giving the usual undertaking as to damages and having regard to the matters deposed to by Jonathan Lee Spark in his affidavit of 14 January 2009, I will make orders 1 to 7 inclusive in a document headed ""Order"" which I will initial and date this day and place with the papers.

   JUDGMENT1. On 16 January 2009 Harry Malavetas pleaded guilty on arraignment to a charge; 
     
      
      “That he between 15 November 2007 and 15 December 2007 at Kings Cross and other places in New South Wales on three or more separate occasions during a period of thirty consecutive days supplied a prohibited drug other than cannabis being cocaine and heroin for financial or material reward.” 
       
      
    There was a second supply charge on the indictment. The Crown did not require a plea to this matter. The parties agreed that, it, together with a goods in custody charge, should not be dealt with on indictment but rather on a Form 1.2. This is not the first occasion since 1991 this offender has been before a court on a supply prohibited drug charge. He has been before the court, on my count, on at least four prior occasions for supplying drugs and on many more occasions for drug related offences.3. The facts relied upon by the Crown are in these terms. A street level undercover operative codenamed “George” was given by his authorised superiors in an authorised transaction, $100 to purchase drugs. He had a conversation with somebody who directed him to a man called “Harry” who he said “would be here in a minute”. The offender appeared and “George” asked him if he had any “Charlie”. The offender instructed him to wait at the scene; left for a few moments, returned, and after having a short conversation with the undercover officer, gave him a telephone number. “George” then walked to Victoria Street with the offender, the other male, and yet a fourth male. He made a telephone call. “George” gave the offender fifty dollars of the $100. The offender disappeared down some stairs on Victoria Street and returned a short time later with a cream coloured balloon. “George” then handed over the other fifty dollars, leaving the scene. That cream balloon given to “George” was found to contain 0.14 grams of cocaine. That is the first of the three necessary supplies relied upon to satisfy the charged ongoing supply. 4. 2:40pm, that is, about five hours later, “George” called the accused on the telephone number he had earlier supplied and arranged for a deal this time involving both cocaine and heroin. “George” received $150 in “buy” money. The offender handed a small plastic bag containing white powder in exchange for fifty dollars. The undercover operative stayed at a nearby coffee shop. The accused went away and returned ultimately with a green balloon and was given surreptitiously the other $100. These plastic bag and green balloon were taken to the police station. The bag contained 0.16 grams of cocaine, the balloon contained 0.06 grams of heroin.5. On 22 November 2007, that is, about seven days later, “George” was again in Kings Cross. This time in possession of $350. Again he called the accused on the topic of drugs. They met; “George” handed the accused $220. The accused entered a house on the corner of Bourke Street and Corfu Lane and returned with two small foils. The $100 was handed to the accused as the two continued to walk into Bourke Street. The accused made a call while “George” waited nearby. The accused was observed as interacting with someone in such a way that it was concluded he had conducted a transaction with an unidentified sixty year-old. The accused returned, handed the undercover operative a lime coloured balloon containing a foil. The accused indicated to the undercover operative that he was able to supply “as much as you want”. The foils and lime balloon were found to contain 0.21 grams of cocaine and 0.12 grams of heroin respectively. That third episode constitutes the third occasion of dealing and in theory the indictment is satisfied by that. 6. The Form 1 matter is in these terms. That the following day one Vance Rogers travelled to Kings Cross and attended the Springfield Mall. He was simply walking and the accused offered to sell him some “speed” for $100. Rogers withdrew money from an ATM and returned with two fifty dollars notes. The accused handed him a small plastic satchel in exchange. Rogers looked at the produce he had received and decided it was crushed up Panadol. He demanded his money back, was arrested by police who had been conducting surveillance and had witnessed the transaction between the two men. The substance supplied to Rogers contained no prohibited drug. That constitutes the offence of supplying methamphetamine. Even though there was no methamphetamine the law provides that when somebody purports to supply it and takes money for so doing he is guilty of the offence. It (the offender’s possession of the money) also constitutes the goods in custody charge, which is also on the Form 1. 7. Six days later on 29 November 2007, “George” again came to Kings Cross and they met in a place that they had designated. “George” was carrying $350. He called the accused who had not earlier met him in that particular location. They arranged to meet in Victoria Street. “George” was wanting both cocaine and heroin. The accused used “George’s” mobile phone to make a call, they walked down Liverpool Street in Darlinghurst. The accused took $210 from “George”, disappeared, returned, handed “George” a pink balloon. There was another mobile call made using the undercover operative’s mobile phone. They this time walked east on Liverpool Street. The undercover operative gave the accused $110. The accused crossed the road and waited on the opposite corner. A male appears, there is an exchange goes on, both men disappear from view. The accused reappears, beckons the undercover operative to follow him to Victoria Street and hands him a lime coloured balloon. The pink balloon was found to contain 0.16 grams of cocaine. The lime balloon was found to contain 0.11 grams of heroin. That is a fourth episode of supply.8. The final event occurs on 10 December 2007. “George” this time arms himself with $920 in pre-recorded money--OFFENDER: I was in custody by then your Honour.HIS HONOUR: It appears you went into custody that day. 9. On 10 December 2007 “George” was armed with $920 in pre-recorded money. He called the accused on a mobile phone number the accused had earlier given him. They arranged to meet at Victoria Street, Kings Cross. There they walked to Liverpool Street, Darlinghurst. The undercover operative handed over $400, waited while the accused approached a male of Middle Eastern appearance who was waiting in a telephone box on Riley Street. Shortly the accused whistled for the “George” to follow him to Liverpool Street. The accused bent down picked up an empty cigarette packet from the ground. Ripped a piece of aluminium foil from it, wrapped it around two small plastic bags containing white powder. They departed. “George” handed the drugs to police. Those two plastic bags were found to container 0.31 grams of cocaine. That is the final episode.10. Shortly after that supply police arrested the accused on 10 December on the corner of Oxford and College Streets as he attempted to board a taxi. After a short struggle he was subdued. Found in his possession were two fifty dollars notes which were matched with money which had been supplied to him from “George” earlier that day. 11. It will be noted that in three of the five episodes of supply both heroin and cocaine were supplied. A total of 0.29 grams of heroin and 0.98 grams of cocaine were supplied. $1290 was spent purchasing the heroin and the cocaine. A further $100 was spent purchasing the methylamphetamine. There is no evidence establishing this offender was the owner of any of the product he supplied to the undercover operative. There is no evidence before the Court that he gained financially from any of the indicted drug deals. At the time of the arrest he was still in possession of at least $100 though of the last deal, suggesting he had gained $100 from that deal. The offender challenges some detail and interpretation of the Crown’s allegations of facts; but apart from the fifth supply episode does not dispute the supplies and occasions on which they occurred. Objective Seriousness12. From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence, offence in this case, as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of this offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in this offence with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences can be evaluated. Not surprisingly the objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. 13. The courts and legislature have made it clear that drug supplying is an unacceptable anti-social criminal activity. It is not difficult to understand why drug supplying is a criminal activity. Contrary to the impression many may have entertained initially, drug use is not a social but rather an anti-social behaviour. The courts have long recognised that in assessing the objective seriousness of a drug offence it is necessary to have regard to the drug’s potential for harm. Harm to others when inflicted by someone else is anti-social. Drug dealing is harmful to the community by its direct impact upon those who purchase drugs and by its indirect impact upon the community at large. 14. The drugs that are the subject of this indictment are both cocaine and heroin. Both are drugs of addiction. Both, if used in quantities, are capable of serious harm. Both, if used over a long period of time, are capable of serious addiction. For some if not for most drugs, but certainly the ones that I am dealing with, can be and are, addictive. They are also destructive, causing or contributing to mental health problems and/or aggression. Supplying drugs can lead to, create, or sustain, drug addicts. Drug addicts are human beings whose capacity to function and feel human is smothered to a greater or lesser extent by addiction and by other effects of drugs. 15. This is the real essence of the criminal harm done by suppliers of drugs. That is, in a greater or a lesser way they are contributing to the dis-enabling of other human beings, and in that sense drug supplying undermines public health. This case, because it was supplying to undercover operatives cannot be said to have contributed to public health problems but the supplies were certainly reckless as to whether they caused public health problems or not. The drugs obviously never made it to anyone who was a drug user. 16. Associated with drug addictions are other forms of crime, such as armed robbery, break and enters and stealings. Indeed this offender has some of those offences, I think the break and enter, on his record, certainly shoplifting, caused by his drug addictions. Associated with those robberies and break and enter offences, speaking generally, is the trauma, emotional and psychological damage done to victims caused by violence and/or other intrusion into their homes. The spending of money by drug addicts on drugs without any corresponding productivity for the community amounts really to little more than a monumental transference of wealth, usually from the already poor, without any corresponding economic gain to the community. At every level then drug dealing is anti-social. 17. It is clear this offender was a go-between delivering purchaser’s money to the suppliers and drugs to the purchaser. The schedule 2 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act sets five broad measures of drug supply as, all other things being equal, five measures of criminality. One gram equates to a small quantity. Three grams amounts to a trafficable quantity. Five grams equates to an indictable quantity. Two hundred and fifty grams amounts to a commercial quantity, and one kilogram amounts to a large commercial quantity. The total cocaine supplied here was 0.93 grams, that is, less than the upper measure for a small quantity. The total heroin supplied was 0.24 grams, again, certainly less than the indictable quantity or the trafficable quantity and equivalent to a small quantity. The total drug supplied would amount to 1.27 grams which is over the small quantity but less than the trafficable quantity. 18. Section 25A, the section under which this charge was laid, was crafted to capture small-time dealers such as this offender, who were dealing frequently yet never had any sufficient quantity of illicit drugs on them when arrested for deemed supply. These perpetual dealers were thought by Parliament to be deliberately avoiding their real criminality by carrying only small quantities of heroin and dealing only in small quantities of heroin. While this was the intention of Parliament, the practice of police, as I have observed it in many cases I have done, is to try to push the last purchases upward to the limit the dealer is prepared to sell. On this occasion the undercover operative had $920 to spend, by far the largest amount he had thus far been authorised to spend. But it would seem could only purchase $400, that is 0.31 grams of cocaine. Malavetas was apparently not able to supply anything other than at the low end of the small quantities. I am satisfied Malavetas was also negotiating with other purchasers, that is to say, this was not an isolated offence to this undercover operative. 19. The offender's case is that he was making no profit. The evidence, at least in the last transaction, would suggest to the contrary, where it would appear he has made about a quarter of what the police officer had given him. I am satisfied however it was to his advantage and benefit to be involved in the transactions as a go-between. The nature of the benefit in other matters is unclear but it is likely to have been money but it may have been drugs.20. The numbers of supply within a month may be an aggravating feature if it reaches above three. In this case there were five episodes of supply. I have already mentioned that in some of the episodes, three of them, both heroin and cocaine were supplied. Measured objectively this offence presents as one towards the lower range of these kind of offences, given the quantities of illicit drugs supplied. It is a serious offence but falling within the low category of seriousness.21. The offender claims entrapment by the undercover operative. I am satisfied there was no entrapment. That does not mean there was not any sense of urgency expressed by the undercover operative. Such conduct would be entirely consistent with the conduct of many purchasers, particularly those “hanging out”. Give this offender's drug abuse history I am satisfied he had witnessed many cases of urgency and pleading for drugs. I do not rule out that he had been desperate on occasions himself. There is a difference between the appearance of desperateness and entrapment. 22. The Form 1 matters are matters that could have been resolved in the Local Court, indeed each of these separate supplies could have been resolved in the Local Court. Taking them into account when sentencing means the sentence for the indictable matter must recognise the extra criminality in its outcome. In this case however the extra weight that I must give to the criminality because of these matters will not drive the sentence upwards by very much. Subjective Matters23. I turn now to the subjective matters. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence but also I am sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the court varies from other offenders who stand or who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to this offender may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by him and some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate. 24. Harry Malavetas was born in Greece. Had never met his sister who resided in Australia. When he was aged sixteen, his sister sponsored him to Australia. Upon arrival he went to Canberra with his sister and her husband, but after sixteen months or so he decided to leave as their relationship became strained. His mother raised him and his seven older siblings with the financial support of her grandmother after his father had abandoned the family when he was very young, three and a half. Both his parents had died in the 1980s and apart from the older sister the remainder of the family are in Greece. 25. As I said earlier, the offender's contact with his elder sister is limited, because of strains no doubt in part caused by his conduct I should imagine. In fact contact with the sister by Probation and Parole confirmed her relationship is poor due to his extensive criminal history. He claims to be the father of an eleven-year-old son with whom he has had no contact and he knows not of the child’s whereabouts. At the time of this offence he was residing by himself in Department of Housing accommodation for about a year in the Waterloo area. 26. I mentioned he had a son. What had happened was, he had formed a relationship, but when his partner was four months pregnant he was arrested and incarcerated. When he was released from custody his partner had left. It is fair to say that he made a number of attempts to contact the son but with no success. 27. From my point of view what is significant is that he has a long standing friendship with a Mr Christes Itskos. He confirms that Mr Malavetas will be staying with him and his wife in the Campbelltown area upon the offender's release and then they will be heading to Mudgee where Mr Itskos has a property. Mr Malavetas will be employed there in timber industry chipping and logging. Mr Itskos has confirmed that he is willing to support Malavetas in his plan to find his own accommodation, presumably in that area, in the near future. Employment and skills27. As would be obvious from what I earlier mentioned, he started schooling in Greece until fifteen when he left school and started working with his brother-in-law as a plasterer. He moved to Australia and worked in his sister’s take-away food shop for sixteen months and then opened a similar shop of his own. He spent time working in fruit and vegetable markets, dry-cleaning, and various other casual employment until his drug addiction affected his ability to work. Currently he has been receiving the disability support pension. Had access to that pension when not in custody since 1996 as a consequence of liver problems. General Health28. As he appears from custody he appears to be in reasonable health, but there are two matters that should be mentioned. Firstly, the liver problems that I just referred to and it would be very hard to tell that from personal appearance, his complexion looks to be all right. Secondly, there is a document which indicated that as a consequence of - he had presented at a casualty doctor, I think at Sydney Hospital, with fractures to his ribs, sternum, larynx, trachea. This was in August of 2007, presenting with painful chest in the mid sternal area after an assault. He was referred to the tertiary pain management unit, and what I do not know is, because there is no recent medical report, whether he is suffering any sequelae from that assault at this point in time. As I say, as I watch him come to and from the court, and that is not a lot of observation time, and as he sits in court he appears to be, as best one can tell, in reasonable general health.Mental Health29. There are mental health issues. He was referred while he was out to the personal support program in May of 2007 and would be receiving, had he been in the community, ongoing support for a two-year period from that time. But the part of that support was access to a personal support program coordinator and part to a psychologist. It was found by the psychologist that he had a surrounding depression and of course a drug addiction. He had identified areas in his life, which he did need to change to bring about recovery and they were also working to address issues affecting his life consistent with the Centrelink assessment of him. Drug Abuse30. He commenced using marijuana and hallucinogenic drugs from the age of nineteen. He moved on to heroin shortly thereafter. He gave up other drugs and used heroin and cannabis until most recently admitted to custody. He was using LSD, cocaine, alcohol, and heroin, which were his principal drugs of choice with heroin being his principal drug of choice. For some, addiction is frequently extremely difficult to harness or conquer. This offender has been struggling with addiction for years. In more recent times he appears not only to be motivated to rehabilitate but also has taken some action to accomplish it. Those are important first steps. He has participated in the Merrit Program in 2007. He completed approximately six weeks of that program until his re-admission into custody. While in custody he has gone to AA and has self referred to the Alcohol and Other Drug services in prison. He advised his only contact with the AOD service since his admission into MRRC has been for preparation of the court report. He is also currently on a Methadone maintenance program.Attitude to Offence31. He claims regret. I am satisfied he wished he had not acted as he did and he understands the consequence of his acts for he has been in custody. He certainly regrets that. However, would he do the same thing if he was at Kings Cross next week. If this is the measure of contrition then I would suspect he would be found wanting. But as I say, he is trying to reform. That includes the intended pursuit of his post release plan to move from Sydney to a rural setting with his friend and to form a working relationship harvesting timber products.Plea of Guilty32. The Crown concedes the plea of guilty had great utilitarian value but not so great as to merit a twenty-five per cent discount. Criminal History33. He is a fifty-two year old man who has not functioned very well in the community, basically because the focus of his life to-date appears to be drugs. He started his criminal offending in 1996 when he was about twenty years old. Significantly the charges related to possessing and using cannabis. There are a number of stealing charges. Possessing prohibited drugs. His first supply conviction occurs in 1991 for which he was given a three-month term of imprisonment. In 1993 he was before the District Court for breaking entering and stealing when he was given a two-year S.558 recognisance. He has been sentenced to imprisonment on several occasions. He was before the court in 2007 for his fourth supply of drug and was sentenced to ten months imprisonment with a six-month non-parole. 34. In March of 2007 he was placed on a twelve-month section 9 bond with supervision requirements. He was called up on that bond for a breach in February of 2008. On that occasion he was sentenced to four months imprisonment. The offender's case is that the bond having been breached and he having been punished for it by imprisonment was no longer in existence. The only way a bond can be terminated is for it to be revoked. It was not revoked before February of 2008. The offending conduct before the court therefore is a breach of the bond. That breach aggravates the objective criminality before the court. His record is substantial. With two exceptions all of his offending had been dealt with in the Local Court. His longest term of imprisonment to-date appears to be one of twelve months. Setting the sentence; deterrence35. This is a case calling for both general and personal deterrence. The maximum penalty for this offence is twenty years imprisonment. The impact of taking the Form 1 matters into account as I say, will drive the sentence upwards but not by much. The appellant has been in custody since his arrest on 10 December 2007 and the sentence will backdate to that date. But for your plea of guilty for this offence I would have sentenced you to a term of imprisonment of three years. I discount that by twenty per cent for your plea, which amounts to seven months. Thus your sentence will be one of two years and five months overall. I find special circumstances. It seems to me that it is important that you have an opportunity to rehabilitate in the community. It is my belief that you are genuine in saying you want to go with Mr Itskos. I intend to set a minimum term of sixteen months.36. Harry Malavetas, for the offence that you between 15 November 2007 and 10 December 2007 at Kings Cross and other places did on more then three separate occasions during a period of thirty consecutive days supply a prohibited drug other than cannabis, namely both cocaine and heroin, for financial or material reward, you are convicted. In respect of that offence you are sentenced to a non-parole period of sixteen months to date from 10 December 2007 and to expire on 9 April 2009. I set an additional term of fifteen months. If there is a need for an order that the drugs be destroyed that order is made.
