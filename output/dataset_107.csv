     JUDGMENT 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: I agree with Fullerton J. 
     
      
    2 FULLERTON J: Shane Kenneth Mangan and Michael John Duffy seek leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court at Dubbo on 27 October 2008 after they both entered pleas of guilty on their arraignment on 19 June 2008 to maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm in company contrary to s 35(2) of the Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    3 The pleas were accepted in discharge of an indictment where the objectively more serious offence of intentionally inflicting grievous bodily harm provided for in s 33(2) of the Crimes Act was also charged. That offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years and a standard non-parole period of 7 years. A maximum penalty of 10 years is provided for a breach of s 35(2) of the Crimes Act. 4 Mr Mangan was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months with a balance of term of 18 months to date from 24 October 2008. Mr Duffy was sentenced to a term of imprisonment comprised of a non-parole period of 15 months with a balance of term of 7 months to date from 27 October 2008. The sentencing judge allowed a discount of 20 per cent for the pleas of guilty in the calculation of both sentences. 
     
      
    The grounds of appeal5 Mr Mangan’s only ground of appeal complained that the sentencing judge imposed sentence on a factual basis that was not open to him on the evidence and that an excessive sentence was imposed as a result. 6 Mr Duffy’s first ground of appeal claimed that his Honour erred in failing to apply a 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty. The second and third grounds of appeal respectively asserted a failure on his Honour’s part to properly assess the role that he played in the commission of the offence and a failure to give sufficient weight to the evidence of his subjective circumstances in mitigation of sentence.The sentence proceedings 
     
      
    7 The applicants were sentenced in separate proceedings convened before the sentencing judge on successive days due to the court’s administrative arrangements. The applicants were, however, in every practical sense co-offenders having participated in a joint criminal enterprise to maliciously inflict grievous bodily harm and being named in the indictment as being in each other's company at the time the offence was committed.  
     
      
    8 In a report tendered in both proceedings Dr Geoffrey Fox, a neuropsychologist, reported that as a result of the head injuries inflicted by Mr Mangan the victim suffered permanent brain damage which was confirmed by CT scans. He also suffered loss of sight in his right eye and multiple fractures to his face requiring surgery. The victim was described by Dr Fox as “significantly handicapped” with deficiencies in cognitive performance and someone who was likely to experience episodes of agitation, anxiety and/or rage as a result of permanent damage to his limbic system. The evidence does not reveal the age of the victim although by reason of his relationship with Mr Mangan’s mother, it is reasonable to assume he was older than both applicants. Mr Mangan was 20 at the time of the offence and Mr Duffy was aged 22.9 The statement of facts tendered by the Crown in each sentence proceeding was identical. It described the offence in the following way: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the 5th of September, 2006 Mangan, Sutcliffe [Mangan’s girlfriend] and Duffy drove to the home of Henderson. Mangan informed Henderson that he had received information concerning his mother and the victim and that there had been in a dispute. 
        
       
       
        
        All four then drove to Meares Street, Mudgee where Beggs [the victim] was seen walking along the street near his home.  
        
       
       
        
        The vehicle, driven by Sutcliffe, stopped nearby Beggs and a fight between Mangan and Beggs commenced with Mangan striking Beggs to the head and upper body with a wooden object similar to a baseball bat or pick handle. Duffy got out of the car, went over to where Beggs was being assaulted by Mangan and commenced to join in the assault. Mangan was continuing to assault Beggs with the wooden object. Beggs fell to the ground and was crying at the end of the assault.” 
        
       
      
    10 The statement of facts went on to describe the designation of a crime scene and the emergency medical treatment administered to the victim. It also noted that when Mr Mangan was interviewed on 6 December 2006 he denied any involvement in the offence and that when Mr Duffy was interviewed on 9 August 2007 he admitted his involvement.  
     
      
    11 Mr Duffy's record of interview was tendered by the Crown in his sentence proceedings. It contained a comprehensive account of the attack on the victim in which he participated and the circumstances in which it occurred, namely by agreement and prearrangement with Mr Mangan and at his instigation. 
     
      
    12 There were no other witness statements tendered to supplement the statement of facts in either sentence proceedings. The only other evidence tendered by the Crown on sentence comprised the applicants’ antecedent reports and pre-sentence reports. Both applicants had relatively minor criminal records. They both reported exposure to illicit drugs and the abuse of alcohol from early adolescence and being heavily intoxicated on the day of the offence. Mr Mangan also admitted to having used amphetamines that day.  
     
      
    13 Given the limited basis upon which Mr Mangan sought leave to appeal against his sentence, I propose to deal with his application first. For that purpose, it is not necessary to refer in detail to the evidence tendered on his behalf. Suffice to note that in a report by Alex Edgar, a forensic psychologist, the applicant sought to account for his conduct in the commission of the offence because of the physical abuse the victim had inflicted on his mother over many years in what appeared to be a highly dysfunctional de facto relationship, and the eruption of his feelings of anger and resentment into violence on the day of the offence. The applicant had also witnessed domestic violence between his parents from a young age and resorted to violence and intimidation in defence of himself when he was bullied as an adolescent. Mr Mangan’s application for leave to appeal:Was there error in the factual findings by the sentencing judge?14 Although there was no objection to the tender of the statement of facts the sentencing judge was informed that not all of the facts were agreed. The facts in dispute were not further identified. They were not identified on the appeal. The finding under challenge on the appeal was not reflected in the statement of facts. I assume, however, that the prosecutor made it clear before the sentence proceedings that he intended to attribute to Mr Mangan the principal role in the joint enterprise and to prove that the assault was committed at his instigation by prearrangement with others, including Mr Duffy. It is not apparent how he proposed to prove those matters given that the statement of facts was silent on the issue.  
     
      
    15 The applicant gave evidence that the attack he launched on the victim was not premeditated. He said that he lost his temper when he came upon the victim by chance having received information that his mother (the victim’s de facto partner) was at the hospital near her home hiding after an argument with the victim. He denied soliciting the assistance of his friends, including Mr Duffy, to seek out the victim with the intention of punishing him in retaliation or retribution at his mother's mistreatment. He gave evidence that when he saw the victim on the street he became angry because the victim looked unconcerned when he knew his mother was hiding at the hospital in fear. He claimed he got out of the car with the piece of wood for protection, but also agreed with the proposition, put by his legal representative, that the attack he launched almost immediately thereafter was “fairly brutal and savage”. He said he believed at the time that the attack was justified, something that he only appreciated was misplaced a year or so after the event when reflecting upon his conduct and the injuries he had inflicted upon the victim. 
     
      
    16 The applicant refused to concede in cross-examination that he was in company with Mr Duffy, his girlfriend and Mr Henderson at the time the offence was committed because of the back-up they might have been called upon to provide in the event that he was successful in finding the victim. The prosecutor sought that concession by reading verbatim from Mr Henderson’s statement to police. The applicant also expressly denied in cross-examination saying to Mr Duffy, “Can you come with me because I'm going to fight him or hit him. Can you give me a hand if I get stuck“. This was something that the prosecutor informed the applicant Mr Duffy had told police in his record of interview. I note that the prosecutor also took the applicant to evidence Mr Duffy gave in his sentence proceedings before the sentencing judge the previous day when he deposed to the fact that the applicant had the piece of wood that he used to assault the victim in his lap as they drove around looking for the victim. Mr Mangan denied this was the case. He claimed that the wood was something he used to prop up the boot of his car on occasions, and that he only reached into the back seat for it when he saw the victim walking on the street and only then with the intention of using it defensively.  
     
      
    17 The sentencing judge made findings adverse to the applicant in a number of respects. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This offence was a very serious and aggravated attack which left the victim unconscious and requiring serious surgery and apparently some long term problems. Nothing can down play the seriousness of this assault. 
        
       
       
        
        It was not just one blow to the victim. There is an element of sustained attack with a stick and the attack continued even when a friend tried to drag him away. Whilst the offender was in company it was this offender who instigated the attack and asked others to come with him and there was nothing in the evidence to suggest that in fact at the time of the phone call from his mother that she had actually been physically attacked at that time by her partner. Whilst it is suggested that the finding of the victim that day was a chance encounter there is a reference in evidence to him picking up friends to be there with him in case.  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        I must find that the offender before me now was the main offender. He deliberately set out with some friends in case he needed assistance, to as it were solve a problem his mother had…” 
        
       
      
    18 There was no challenge on the appeal to his Honour’s finding that Mr Mangan instigated the attack upon the victim or that he was the principal offender. On any view of the matters in contest at the sentence proceedings this was a finding open to him. His Honour was also entitled to assess the applicant’s evidence as to the circumstances in which the attack occurred in the context of his admitted and entrenched antipathy towards the victim. The applicant submitted, however, that there was no evidence to support a series of interrelated findings in other parts of the sentencing reasons extracted above, namely that the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) deliberately set out with some friends in case he needed assistance to solve a problem that his mother had,  
        and 
         
        (b) that he asked others to come with him, and that he picked up friends to be there with him in case.  
        
       
      
    19 These findings operated, so it was submitted, to impermissibly aggravate the offending because they were not supported by the evidence and were not otherwise capable of being established by inference from the evidence. Furthermore, it was submitted they were findings contradicted by the applicant’s sworn evidence that he came upon the victim by chance and that his friends were with him simply because he asked them to come with him to collect his mother. It was open to the prosector to invite his Honour to reject the applicant’s evidence on these matters as untruthful but that does not compel a finding that the converse was true. 
     
      
    20 Although his Honour made no finding adverse to the applicant on the basis of his allegedly having the weapon at hand in the car in preparation for the assault, the approach taken by the prosecutor when he referred the applicant to Mr Duffy’s evidence given the previous day, Mr Duffy’s account to police upon his arrest and to the contents of Mr Henderson’s statement, none of which were in evidence, was misguided. The prosecutor did not put to the applicant what he had allegedly said in the lead up to committing the offence and in the course of committing it drawn from that material which would have been an appropriate way of legitimately testing the applicant’s claim that he did not have the intention of harming the victim until he chanced upon him, and that he was not in the company of Mr Duffy and the others by prearrangement in case he needed back-up. Alternatively, he could have invited the applicant to read particular answers given by Mr Duffy in the record of interview, or to read parts of the narrative account in Mr Henderson’s statement to police and then to have asked the applicant to either confirm that the information was true, or to identify where it was false, in accordance with s 44(3) of the Evidence Act 1995. If the prosecutor was confronted with denials to questions framed in this way, as he must have expected would be the case, it was then open to him to attempt to prove those matters by admissible evidence. I note in that connection that Mr Duffy’s bail was continued at the conclusion of his sentence proceedings the previous day and that he was a compellable witness in the applicant’s sentence proceedings. Instead, the questions put in cross-examination not only revealed the source of the information contrary to the restriction on the use of previous representations in s 44 of the Evidence Act, but the form of the question was objectionable since it contained the assertion that the cross-examiner considered Mr Duffy (and Mr Henderson) to be telling the truth and invited the applicant to comment upon their veracity and admit that he was a liar by comparison. In the result and despite the fact that there was no objection to any of the questions put to the applicant by the prosecutor, the cross-examination was conducted inappropriately and with what I regard as associated unfairness. The applicant at no time conceded that he knew what Mr Duffy (or Mr Henderson) had told the police, much less that they had told the truth, and he ought not to have been invited to comment on their veracity at all.  
     
      
    21 Although it is not the law that a sentencing court is required to sentence on the facts most favourable to an offender, if sentence is to be imposed by reference to a finding adverse to an offender, and that finding extends beyond an admission of the essential elements of the offence inherent in the plea of guilty, the facts in support of such a finding must be established beyond reasonable doubt. While it is true that the sentencing judge did not specifically refer to planning or premeditation as an aggravating factor in accordance with s 21A(2)(n) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, he did sentence the applicant on the basis that he deliberately set out with some friends in case he needed assistance to deal with the victim. This was a finding adverse to the applicant and one that his Honour considered deprived him of the leniency that might otherwise have been available on his subjective case. It was only on the basis of admissible evidence (or inferences capable of being drawn from such evidence) that it was open to the prosecutor to refer to any of these matters as aggravating features of the offending or for his Honour to regard them as such.  
     
      
    22 It was the prosector’s duty to ensure that the adverse findings he invited the sentencing judge to make were established by admissible evidence. He failed to do so and I am satisfied that error infected the judge’s fact finding exercise as a result. It would also seem that his Honour may have transposed into the applicant’s sentence proceedings facts he found established in Mr Duffy’s sentence proceedings, given the detailed admissions in his record of interview. Nevertheless, it was the responsibility of the prosecutor to assist the sentencing judge so as to protect against the risk of this occurring. 
     
      
    23 Although I am satisfied that his Honour did not have an adequate evidential foundation to make the findings under challenge beyond reasonable doubt, he was nevertheless entitled to regard the attack by the applicant as a vicious and sustained revenge attack which he launched when he saw the victim on the street. His Honour did refer to fact that the victim’s injuries resulted in permanent disability and the fact that there was a weapon used to inflict the injuries as features of aggravation under s 21A(2). There was no challenge to that finding on the appeal.  
     
      
    24 In all the circumstances, and notwithstanding the fact that the error identified in the applicant’s sole ground of appeal has been made out, I am not persuaded that an undiscounted sentence of imprisonment of 5 years against the statutory maximum of 10 years was excessive in the circumstances. The objective seriousness of the offending was substantial. The fact that the applicant may not have foreseen or intended the extent of harm that resulted from the attack does not reduce the level of objective seriousness. The offence was not only properly aggravated by the nature and extent of the injuries suffered by the victim, and that a weapon was used to inflict them but, in my view, it was not mitigated to any material degree either by the applicant’s motivation to exact revenge because of the victim’s persistent mistreatment of his mother or by his level of intoxication. The ingestion of a cocktail of alcohol and drugs cannot excuse criminal conduct or its consequences. In an appropriate case, it may mitigate the offending to some extent where intoxication is indicative of the offence being committed on impulse or where it can be said that the offender's capacity to exercise judgment was otherwise impaired because of it (see Waters v R [2007] NSWCCA 219 at [38]). In the present case, absent a basis in the admissible evidence to ground a finding that the offence was premeditated, or that the applicant co-opted others to assist him to seek out and attack the victim, I accept that the influence of the intoxicants may have had some disinhibiting effect when the applicant chanced upon the victim en route to collecting his mother. This does not, however, moderate the degree of objective seriousness otherwise reflected in the evidence. The primary significance of the applicant’s drug and alcohol use went to his prospects of rehabilitation in light of the evidence from Ms Edgar that he had taken steps, albeit some time after the offence, to address longstanding issues of addiction. In addition, although the applicant expressed regret and remorse in his evidence, his appreciation of the serious criminality inherent in his offending would also appear to have crystallised some considerable time after the offending. For this reason, the quality of his contrition as a mitigating factor was muted to some degree.  
     
      
    25 It was submitted on the appeal that the applicant’s motive in instigating the attack ameliorated the seriousness of the offending. It is appropriate to emphasise that a grievance with another, whether justified or not, and irrespective of that person’s proven wrongdoing or suspected wrongdoing, cannot authorise the commission of a crime (see R v Mitchell, R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296; 177 A Crim R 94 at [23] and [30]-[32]. In the circumstances of the present case, and without underplaying the reality of the pain that all family members suffer where violence in a domestic setting is persistent and entrenched, the applicant’s motive for assaulting the victim was of negligible mitigating value. 26 After applying the discount for the plea of guilty to an undiscounted sentence of 5 years, and after finding special circumstances on the basis of the applicant’s youth and the fact that he has not previously served time in custody, a non-parole period of 2 years and 6 months was imposed with a balance of term of 18 months. I am not persuaded that another sentence is warranted at law as provided for in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
     
      
    The application for leave to appeal by Mr Duffy 27 I turn now to consider the grounds of appeal relied upon by Mr Duffy. Ground 1: the sentencing judge failed to give an appropriate discount the plea of guilty 
     
      
    28 In my view, the first ground of appeal cannot be sustained. Although his Honour did not make patent why a discount of 25 per cent was not allowed for the plea of guilty this Court has repeatedly stated that the assessment of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty is discretionary and that there is no presumption or entitlement to any particular discount within the guideline range: R v Scott [2003] NSWCCA 286 at [28]. The digest of the authorities most recently undertaken by Howie J in R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 endorses the principle that it is the timing of the plea that is of primary importance in the assessment of its utilitarian value. 
     
      
    29 The applicant's reliance on R v Johnstone [2004] NSWCCA 307 as authority for the proposition that his Honour should have provided reasons explaining why the discount of 25 per cent was not applied is misplaced. As the Crown correctly pointed out in her submissions, the Court in Johnstone was concerned with an allowance by a sentencing judge of a 15 per cent discount for a plea of guilty in a combined discount of 50 per cent for the plea and assistance to authorities. The Court was satisfied that that combined discount was within the range of a sound sentencing discretion, but that error resulted from the failure of the sentencing judge to provide a brief, clear and simple explanation as to why the discount for the plea was moderated. The case is not authority for the proposition that in every case a judge needs to give reasons for not applying a discount of 25 per cent, or a discount approaching that figure.30 It is clear from the sentencing remarks that a 20 per cent discount in the calculation of the applicant’s sentence was applied in circumstances where the plea of guilty was entered on arraignment in the District Court 18 months after the offence was committed and 10 months after the applicant was charged. The fact that it was not an early plea in a strict temporal sense was conceded before the sentencing judge. Both in submissions before sentencing judge and before this Court, what counsel sought to emphasise was that when he was interviewed by police almost 12 months after the offence the applicant made full admissions to each element of an offence contrary to s 35 of the Crimes Act, the offence to which he ultimately pleaded guilty on arraignment and the offence with which he was initially charged. Some time after the charge under s 35 was laid he was charged with the more serious offence under s 33 and, since that offence was strictly indictable, the matter proceeded as a committal for trial. Prior to the indictment being framed, and after representations were made on his behalf, an alternate count charging the s 35 offence was included on the indictment to which a plea of guilty was entered which the prosecutor accepted in full discharge of the indictment.  
     
      
    31 As Howie J recognised in R v SY & Anor [2003] NSWCCA 291 at [86] it does not always follow that a plea is entered at the first reasonable opportunity when the plea is entered on arraignment and after the Crown frames an indictment, including an alternate count, following negotiations or discussions with an offender’s representatives. His Honour went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “…Clearly there will be occasions where the nature of the bargain struck does indicate that the offender could not reasonably have been expected to plead guilty before the opportunity was presented to plead to some less serious charge. But that is not always so and it behoves the sentencing judge to look at the situation realistically in determining the value of the plea on the utilitarian basis…” 
        
       
      
    32 Despite there being some force in the complaint that the sentencing judge should have allowed a discount of 25 per cent, his appointment of the utilitarian value in the plea of guilty was essentially a discretionary matter. Accordingly, it should not be disturbed by this Court unless the exercise of the discretion is shown to be unreasonable in accordance with the principle in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499. I am unable to come to the positive view that the discretion has miscarried. Even were I wrong in this view, and a proper exercise of the discretion would have allowed for a 25 per cent discount for the plea of guilty, the applicant must demonstrate a sentence other than the sentence that was imposed is warranted in law as provided for in s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. I am not persuaded that this is the case.  
     
      
    Ground two: Was there error in the appointment of the applicant’s role? 
     
      
    33 The applicant’s second ground of appeal contended that his Honour wrongly attributed to him conduct in the way he participated in the assault more egregious than his admitted conduct and, for that reason, he proceeded to sentence the applicant on an erroneous basis.  
     
      
    34 Consistent with his account to police, the applicant gave evidence that he punched the victim in the chest as he was crouching over under attack from Mr Mangan who was thrashing him with the piece of wood (and that he threw a bottle at the victim). However he denied kicking the victim whilst he was on the ground. There was also uncontested evidence from the applicant that after punching the victim he withdrew from the attack and that he attempted to prevent Mr Mangan from continuing to assault the victim who was on the ground and obviously seriously injured.  
     
      
    35 In his remarks on sentence his Honour correctly attributed to the applicant the punches delivered at the victim’s chest but wrongly attributed to him kicks while the victim was on the ground at a time when he had already been repeatedly struck with heavy blows delivered by Mr Mangan. After imposing sentence but before the sentence proceedings concluded the error was drawn to his Honour’s attention by the prosecutor. The concession was accompanied by the submission that the error did not require any amendment to the sentence. His Honour accepted, without question, that he had made the error and openly acknowledged that he may have unwittingly transposed evidence from Mr Mangan’s sentence proceedings as the source of the error. He was not however persuaded that the error had any material bearing on the sentence. In that regard he is recorded as saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “… in the facts before me it makes no material difference because I considered that while I was thinking about it and I went on - well doesn’t make any difference and I was going on the basis of kicking (sic) but being actively participating, that’s the major point.” 
        
       
      
    36 The question is whether the applicant has persuaded this Court that, contrary to what his Honour decided, the error was in fact material and that his Honour’s finding that it made no material difference to the sentence compounded the error.  
     
      
    37 I am unable to view the error as either bearing the significance contended for by the applicant or to view his Honour’s implicit refusal to amend the sentencing order as demonstrative of error. While it was appropriate for sentencing purposes for a distinction to be drawn between the respective roles played by the co-offenders in the joint criminal enterprise, including the markedly different physical assaults they perpetrated upon the victim, they were nonetheless responsible at law for the acts of the other. Under cross-examination, the applicant conceded that even before Mr Mangan went to collect Mr Henderson as an additional reinforcement he had agreed to participate in assaulting the victim and that he did so without reservation. He also conceded that he joined in the assault at a time when the victim was already being beaten with a piece of wood and that he was crouched over under the reign of blows. For my part, the fact that he some short time later sought to intervene to prevent the attack continuing, it seems with the intention of avoiding what might have proved to be a homicide, does nothing to ameliorate the seriousness of the offence in which he had been a willing and active participant (see McKenna v R [2007] NSWCCA 113).  
     
      
    38 Accordingly the second ground appeal must fail. 
     
      
    Ground three: the sentencing judge failed to give sufficient weight to the applicant’s subjective circumstances 
     
      
    39 Together with the pre-sentence report, the sentencing judge received a report from a psychologist and some personal references attesting to the applicant’s work history and good character, including a reference from the applicant’s mother. She described the applicant as a caring and considerate person who was not prone to violence. She described him as hard working and responsible. In so far as his work history is concerned, it would appear that the applicant committed himself to an apprenticeship as a spray-painter after leaving high school and that it was only because of a downturn in work in the Wollongong area that he was in Mudgee at the time of the offence. The applicant informed the probation and parole officer he felt isolated in his new surroundings and, for that reason, that he was vulnerable to the influence of his co-offender and the associated abuse of alcohol. Upon his return to Wollongong after the offence he regained employment with his previous employer and completed his apprenticeship. His employer provided a reference where he was described as highly dependable, intelligent, capable and dedicated. 
     
      
    40 His Honour was satisfied that the applicant had sound prospects of rehabilitation. His Honour also recognised that sentencing an offender for a serious offence of violence, in circumstances where there is no previous record of violence and where the role played in a joint criminal enterprise was that of secondary participant, requires a sentencing court to approach the question of sentence with caution, particularly where, as with this applicant, there were subjective considerations that might otherwise warrant considerable leniency. The weight to be afforded those considerations in the calculation of sentence was a matter for the discretion of the sentencing judge.  
     
      
    41 Acknowledging as I must the required by this Court (see APT v R [2009] NSWCCA 230 at [13]) exercises when there is a challenge to the weight a sentencing judge is said to have afforded subjective circumstances, I am not persuaded that his Honour failed to consider the evidence bearing upon the applicant’s personal and vocational circumstances or his future prospects, or that he failed to attribute them due weight as part of the sentencing exercise. The third ground of appeal is not made out.  
     
      
    42 Accordingly, the orders I propose in each case are as follows:1. Leave to appeal against sentence is granted.2. The appeal is dismissed.43 McCALLUM J: I agree with Fullerton J.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Rothman J, which sets out the relevant facts. 
     
      
    2 Sentences imposed on other people for crimes that bear some similarity to the crime in question can legitimately be looked at as part of the process of a judge fixing a sentence. But in themselves they will not inform the judge of the range of sentences that would properly be open in a correct application of sentencing principles. It is the sentencing principles themselves that it is the duty of the judge to apply. They include taking account of the maximum penalty that Parliament has prescribed for the offence in question, and how the criminality of the particular mode of committing the offence that is being sentenced for compares to the criminality of the various possible ways in which a contravention of the particular prohibition that creates the offence could occur. 
     
      
    3 Statistics about the sentences that have been imposed for a particular offence can be of some assistance in informing the judge about the range of sentences that have actually been imposed for that offence. But the use of such statistics is limited. Part of the reason why that is so is because consideration of the range of sentences actually imposed is at best a check that the judge is correctly applying the sentencing principles. Part is because the statistics leach out many of the objective facts and all of the subjective circumstances that must be taken into account in a sentencing decision. Part is because the limited number of sentences that make up the sentences summarised by the statistics do not necessarily cover the full range of circumstances in which that particular crime can be committed. This list does not purport to be exhaustive. 
     
      
    4 For the reasons given by Rothman J at [43]-[47] the sentences in this case were not manifestly excessive. I agree with the order proposed by Rothman J. 
     
      
    5 HOWIE J: I agree with Rothman J.  
     
      
    6 ROTHMAN J: The applicant, Mr Han, seeks leave to appeal and, if granted, appeals the sentence imposed by his Honour Judge Knox SC of the District Court. Mr Han pleaded not guilty to two charges of demanding money with menaces, the maximum penalty for each being imprisonment for 14 years. He was convicted by a jury and sentenced by his Honour in relation to one of those charges (Count 1) to imprisonment for 3 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years and, in relation to the second of those charges (Count 3), to imprisonment for a fixed term of 12 months, wholly concurrent with the non-parole period in the other count. There is no standard non-parole period for the offences here in question. 
     
      
    7 The first offence (Count 1) occurred on or about 13 August 2006 and the second offence (Count 3) occurred between 28 April 2007 and 3 May 2007. The offences are referred to, respectively, as Counts 1 and 3 (Count 2 relates to two other offenders, who demanded money with menaces against the same person in similar or related circumstances). There were also counts of dealing with the proceeds of crime, which are currently irrelevant.  
     
      
    8 In respect to Count 2, relating to Messrs Hu and Huang, Mr Hu was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months, with a non-parole period of 12 months, and Mr Huang was sentenced to imprisonment for 18 months, the sentence then wholly suspended.  
     
      
    9 In his notice of appeal, Mr Han raised the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      In relation to Count 1 (the Campsie offence):  
       
       
      Ground 1: The sentence was manifestly excessive; 
       
       
      Ground 2: Error in the finding of fact that the demand for money was based on one box removed from the restaurant and placed in the victim’s car; 
       
       
      Ground 3: Error in the finding of fact that Mr Han knew that the threats were made and the general nature of them.  
       
       
      In relation to Count 3 (the Carlingford offence): 
       
       
      Ground 4: The sentence was manifestly excessive; 
       
       
      Ground 5: Lack of parity between the sentence imposed upon Mr Han and the sentences imposed upon Messrs Hu and Huang.  
       
      
    10 At the hearing, no grounds, other than manifest excess, were pressed. 
     
      
    11 The somewhat cryptic reference in ground 2, above, to the finding of fact based upon one box removed, relates to an attempt to suggest that the demand for money made by Mr Han related to the benefits received by the victim, Mr Alan Lo, from conduct that Mr Han described as larceny, by Mr Lo, as a servant. It is necessary to recite the facts before dealing with the ground of appeal. 
     
      
    Facts 
     
      
    12 Mr Han, hereinafter referred to as the applicant, was the owner of a restaurant at Campsie. The victim, Mr Lo, was an employee of the applicant. During the course of 2006, the applicant became concerned that he was losing money in the restaurant and considered that someone was pilfering goods from him. As a consequence of that concern, he went to some trouble and expense to install a CCTV camera and related security equipment.  
     
      
    13 Sometime during the course of 2006, the applicant was shown a video of the victim leaving the restaurant with a box, which was a polystyrene box.  
     
      
    14 On 13 August 2006, the victim asked Mr Chen, the manager of the restaurant, for his wages, as he had not been paid for the previous two weeks. Mr Chen asked him to go upstairs with him, where Mr Chen showed the victim the video of the victim exiting the rear of the restaurant with a box. Mr Chen accused the victim of stealing things from the restaurant. The victim denied stealing anything and explained that the box was empty and that he had intended using it to store things. During the course of this conversation, the applicant and two other persons entered the room.  
     
      
    15 Mr Chen demanded compensation from the victim, who asked how much Mr Chen was prepared to accept. The evidence was that the victim had asked that question because he believed that these men had a criminal background and that he was scared for his safety and he was prepared to pay an amount. The victim suggested the sum of $2,000. The applicant rejected that amount and the applicant continued to ask the victim to calculate the amount that he considered he needed to pay.  
     
      
    16 At one point during this conversation, when all of the abovementioned were in the room, a demand was made on the victim that he pay $17,700. At the time that this conversation was occurring, the victim was owed wages to the amount of $2,700. He was told that he needed to pay an amount of $15,000 and forego the wages that he was owed. The victim made it clear that he did not have that amount of money.  
     
      
    17 No attempt was made to explain how it was said the figure of $17,700 was calculated. He was then told that he needed a guarantor for the debt and the suggestion was made that his girlfriend be rung by him and asked to guarantee the amount. The victim was told that if the girlfriend did not arrive before 2.00am, there was no guarantee as to what would happen. The girlfriend owned another restaurant. The victim was told that if the girlfriend did not arrive and/or the guarantee not be arranged, someone would be sent to burn down her restaurant and also hurt the victim’s family. The victim rang his girlfriend, who arrived shortly thereafter.  
     
      
    18 During the time that the five men were waiting for the girlfriend to arrive, Mr Chen, the manager, required the victim to copy, in his own handwriting, a document the effect of which was that it acknowledged a debt for $17,700, less the salary for two weeks, to be paid by 15 August. The document was in Chinese and was referred to at the trial and in the remarks on sentence as the “I.O.U”.  
     
      
    19 When the victim’s girlfriend arrived, she too was shown the video. The victim protested his innocence, to which Mr Chen reacted by telling him to “shut up”. Mr Chen made the comment that he needed to teach the victim a lesson. There was some discussion between the victim and his girlfriend, after which the girlfriend, scared of what might happen, offered to pay $5,000 to settle the matter. This offer was rejected. Mr Chen demanded at least $15,000. When the girlfriend asked what would happen if that amount could not be provided, Mr Chen said: “you know who I am, and you also know that I have a lot of brothers around.” 
     
      
    20 The girlfriend signed the document as guarantor, upon which the victim and she were allowed to leave. Unsuccessful attempts were made to finance the amount of money. On 15 August 2006, the victim reported the matter to police. The police contacted Mr Chen, who informed them that the victim had been confronted over allegations that he was stealing stock and had agreed to pay back $15,000. Mr Chen denied any wrongdoing.  
     
      
    21 On 2 September 2006, police attended the applicant’s restaurant for a meeting with the applicant and the applicant’s counsel. A solicitor was also present. The police were provided with the CCTV tape, the I.O.U document and some other ancillary documentation. Police requested an itemised account, written in English, of what, it was said, the victim had stolen.  
     
      
    22 The victim, understandably, did not return to the restaurant and gained other employment. On 29 April 2007, his new employer told him that two men (Messrs Hu and Huang) were waiting to see him. The victim did not know, at this stage, either of these men. Mr Hu (who called himself, and is referred to as, “Fat Tom”) told the victim that he owed money to his former boss and that he had come to collect it. Mr Hu referred to the amount of $10,000 and there was a reference to the I.O.U. He also made it clear that if he didn’t pay off the debt there may be trouble, and that he would return the next night.  
     
      
    23 After this conversation, the victim became scared and contacted police at 1.00am on 30 April 2007. Arrangements were made for the victim to wear a listening device. When Messrs Hu and Huang arrived at the restaurant on the next evening, the conversation was recorded. Mr Hu referred to himself as “Big Circle Fat Tom”. “Big Circle” referred to an alleged gang. The victim told them that he could pay them $1,000 first up, but wanted a receipt. With that comment, the victim handed over $1,000, in marked notes, that had been provided to him by the police.  
     
      
    24 The next day, the victim rang Mr Hu and told him that, as a result of a windfall at the casino, he, the victim, was able to pay off the remaining $9,000. He also tried, unsuccessfully, to telephone the applicant. The applicant returned his call. In that conversation, the victim asked the applicant whether he had sent “Tom” over to see him and collect the debt and whether he, the applicant, had received the $1,000. The applicant replied in the affirmative. The applicant made it clear that the victim needed to pay the balance and “if you are looking for trouble, I can surely give you a lot of trouble through my boys.” 
     
      
    25 On 3 May 2007, the victim, once more fitted with a listening device, paid over $9,000, provided by the police, to Messrs Hu and Huang. Shortly thereafter, Messrs Hu and Huang were arrested and found to be in possession of the $9,000, plus some of the original $1,000. The applicant was, at that stage, also arrested by police and charged with these matters.  
     
      
    26 As earlier stated, the applicant contended at trial that he had a genuine belief that the victim owed him money as a result of his pilfering or embezzlement of food and other stock. Thus, it was said, the applicant’s threats were part of a legitimate commercial debt recovery process. The applicant gave evidence at the trial. His evidence was that a stocktake had found that some $18,000 worth of items were missing and he denied threatening the victim. He accepted that money had been sought from the victim and he accepted that he sent Mr Hu and Mr Huang around to collect money, when the victim was working at Carlingford. He denied, however, that he asked either Mr Hu or Mr Huang to threaten the victim.  
     
      
    27 The express finding of fact by the trial judge, and the necessary result of the finding of guilt by the jury, is that the applicant’s claim that there was a legitimate debt was rejected and the amount that he had sought from the victim was money to which the applicant was not entitled. The foregoing summary of facts is taken largely from the summary by the Crown, in this appeal, but fairly represents the findings of fact by the sentencing judge, and the material that had been adduced during the course of the trial. The foregoing summary is sufficient for the purpose of understanding the discussion on the grounds of appeal, which are next discussed.  
     
      
    Ground of Appeal 
     
      
    28 As earlier stated, at hearing, senior counsel appearing for the applicant pressed no grounds other than manifest excess, and in that regard, seemingly only in relation to the sentence for the offence that is Count 1. Nevertheless, some comment needs to be made on the other grounds of appeal, because the raising of some of those grounds affects the discussion on manifest excess, even though the grounds are no longer pressed.  
     
      
    29 The grounds relating to what are essentially findings of fact, namely, grounds 2 and 3 in relation to the Campsie offence, disclose that, even at the time that the grounds of appeal were drafted, Mr Han had no understanding of the nature of his criminality, or remorse for his conduct. A jury necessarily found that the applicant knew that the threats were made and the general nature of them, because absent such a finding, the applicant would not have been found guilty.  
     
      
    30 The ground of appeal, relating to whether the threats and demand for money were based upon one box being removed from the restaurant, or more material than that, shows most clearly that there is little or no remorse or understanding of the nature of the criminality of the conduct. It is not for individuals in society to enforce their own debts by the making of threats of physical harm. It is fundamental, to the rule of law and the nature of civilised society, that any allegation that debts are owed, when contested, is resolved independently and by the judicial process.  
     
      
    31 Even assuming, of which there is no evidence, that the victim in this case had stolen $18,000 worth of goods, it is not for the applicant to threaten physical violence, on two separate occasions, in order to obtain the amount that he considers he was owed. Moreover, the issue of whether the applicant was, in fact, owed this amount of money was put directly to the jury by the trial judge and the jury received specific instructions on it. Once more, the raising of this ground at the stage of appeal shows, fairly clearly, that the applicant does not appreciate the effect of the jury verdict, nor that his conduct was wrong, and does not appreciate the criminality of his conduct. Nevertheless, the applicant is entitled to raise grounds of appeal and cannot be punished more severely for exercising his fundamental rights.  
     
      
    32 I turn then to the issue pressed on appeal, namely manifest excess. All or most sentencing is a process of intuitive synthesis: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 22 CLR 357. A ground of appeal based on manifest excess is, more than most, within that category. Nevertheless, there are some aspects of the submissions put in support of the ground of appeal that require comment.  
     
      
    33 The submissions on appeal raised an issue of whether the submission was based upon some proposition of parity amongst offenders, who are not co-offenders. Senior counsel for the applicant eschewed such a submission. This approach of senior counsel was both appropriate and correct.  
     
      
    34 It is impermissible to compare, in the sense that one compares sentences for co-offenders, sentences imposed on offenders for different offences: R v Morgan (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371; R v F [2002] NSWCCA 320; (2002) 132 A Crim R 308 at 315; R v George [2004] NSWCCA 247; (2004) 149 A Crim R 38 at 47; R v Singh [2001] NSWCCA 424 at [12]. In R v Araya [2005] NSWCCA 283, Johnson J, with whom Simpson J and I agreed, summarised the law, as it then applied, at [53]-[71]. With great respect to his Honour Justice Johnson, I adopt that summary.  
     
      
    35 It is relevant to note that the parity principle is based upon the principle of equal justice. That principle requires that like should be treated with like, but, to the extent that there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them: Lowe v R [1984] HCA 46; (1984) 154 CLR 606, in particular at 623 per Dawson J; Postiglione v R [1997] HCA 26; (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301, per Dawson and Gaudron JJ.  
     
      
    36 As is made clear in all of the cases, a discrepancy in sentence is not, even in respect to co-offenders, a basis for appeal, or for overturning a sentence. That which is required is a disparity that is unjustifiable. This is an aspect of equal justice.  
     
      
    37 It is impermissible to compare, for the purposes of disparity, sentences for different offences. No two offences are the same, and a difference in the sentence imposed on offenders, who have been engaged in different conduct and been charged with different offences, is to be expected.  
     
      
    38 The principles of equal justice, in relation to contraventions of the same law, but different conduct and offences, is implemented through the application of the principle of consistency in sentencing, which seeks to ensure that the sentence that is imposed is within the range of sentences available for the particular offence and the particular offender. As was said by Simpson J in R v F, supra, at 315: 
     
      
       
        
        “Consistency in sentencing may be achieved by the slavish adoption, by a subsequent court, of a sentence selected by an earlier court when the facts are comparable. However, that would be consistency purchased at the cost of the sacrifice of the proper exercise of judicial discretion. Within the bounds of the appropriate range of sentences, each sentencing judge (either at first instance or following appeal) must bring to bear his or her own independent assessment of the particular case. 
         
         
        … Consistency is not derived from a single case. Consistency in sentencing will be achieved from a range of cases involving similar features, and also variables. It depends upon the accumulated wisdom and experience of sentencing judges. In my opinion a single case is inadequate to enable a principled consistent approach. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Moreover, while consistency in sentencing is, no doubt, an important goal, equally important for the administration of justice is the public perception that sentences imposed by criminal courts are appropriate to the nature and seriousness of the crime committed.” 
        
       
      
    Meagher JA (at 309-310) and Howie J (at 316-317) agreed with Simpson J, but preferred to use the words “more important” rather than “equally important”, when referring to the public perception that sentences imposed must be appropriate to the nature and seriousness of the crime committed. With great respect, I adopt the comment that the appropriateness of the sentence, given the seriousness and nature of the crime committed, is a “more important”, rather than “equally important”, principle.  
     
      
    39 It is in the context of determining an appropriate range, that reliance is often placed upon statistics. The difficulty with reliance upon statistics is that an overly strict reliance on the range of sentences previously imposed will be a self-fulfilling limitation, which may bear no relationship to the maximum sentence or the criminality of the conduct.  
     
      
    40 In the circumstances of the current offences with which the applicant was to be sentenced, as earlier stated, the maximum penalty, for each of Count 1 and Count 3, was 14 years’ imprisonment. The overall sentence imposed was, because of concurrency, a non-parole period of 2 years as part of an overall sentence of 3 years. The statistics disclose that 61% of persons sentenced (other than in the Local Court) for an offence of this kind have a prison sentence imposed upon them, of which the heaviest sentence imposed was 42 months, and the lightest was 12 months. The median offender was sentenced to 18 months, and the median non-parole period was 6 months. I consider such a range of sentences, in light of the statutory maximum, inexplicable. Of course, the statistics include all persons who pleaded guilty, were granted reductions for assistance to police and law enforcement agencies and the like. Nevertheless, the proposition that the heaviest sentence ever imposed was 3 ½ years, in circumstances where the maximum penalty is 14 years, is less than one might expect.  
     
      
    41 There are possible explanations. The more serious offences may also be a contravention of s 86 of the Crimes Act 1900 (kidnapping), with a maximum sentence of 20 years. Alternatively, most of the serious offences may have been subject to multiple charges each of which is lighter than might otherwise be the case. A third possibility may be that coincidentally all of the previous offences may have been lower level offences. Whatever be the situation, the range disclosed by the statistics does not adequately reflect the seriousness of this offence, now before the Court.  
     
      
    42 Notwithstanding the foregoing comment, and notwithstanding that I consider the range of sentences suggests too lenient an approach, it is inappropriate that Mr Han be used as a scapegoat for the increase in that range of sentences.  
     
      
    43 However, Mr Han was sentenced for two offences. The sentencing judge noted, with which comment I agree, that the two separate offences were separated in time and that the offences required and deserved separate sentences. Nevertheless, the effect of the sentence imposed is that no separate punishment was imposed. Even if I were to use the range of sentences included in the statistics that have been provided, and I were to accept the description of his Honour, the sentencing judge, that the culpability was low to mid range, it would be necessary for me to impose a separate punishment for each of Count 1 and Count 3.  
     
      
    44 While there would be some degree of concurrence, the sentences ought not to have been wholly concurrent. When imposing a sentence for more than one offence, the sentencing judge is required to fix an appropriate sentence for each offence and then consider questions of concurrence. Unless it can be said that each offence is committed as part of a single criminal activity, the sentences should be determined without reference to each other and, then, by imposing the sentences wholly or partially concurrently, the sentencing judge achieves the necessary degree of punishment for the total criminal conduct: Pearce v R [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610; Mill v R [1988] HCA 70; (1988) 166 CLR 59; Johnson v R [2004] HCA 15; (2004) 205 ALR 346; (2004) 78 ALJR 616.  
     
      
    45 In this case, his Honour had two separate offences, which required separate punishment, with a degree of concurrence. Instead, his Honour fixed a sentence for Count 1, which may have been heavier than the sentence imposed on a median offender based on the range of sentences that is currently available on the statistics provided, but then fixed a second sentence (Count 3) that was wholly concurrent and below mid-range. This is an unorthodox approach. Nevertheless, the sentence imposed for Count 1 is not a sentence that is beyond the range that was available for the criminality involved in the offence. In my view, it is not beyond that which is available, even by comparison with the inadequate sentences that seem to be reflected in the statistics. Even if it were excessive by comparison with the current statistics, if one were required to quash the sentence, one would need to quash the sentence imposed for both Count 1 and Count 3 and re-sentence accordingly, and on no reasonable analysis of the overall sentence imposed could it be said that the overall sentence was manifestly excessive, taking into account both offences. The overall non-parole period is less than the 3:1 ratio that the statute requires.  
     
      
    46 On the range of sentences evidenced in the statistics provided, which, as I have said, I consider to be an inappropriate range for the criminality involved, such an overall sentence for two offences (even accounting for the degree of overlap between the criminal conduct) is not manifestly excessive. A fortiori, it is not a sentence that is manifestly excessive measured by what is appropriate for the criminal conduct involved.  
     
      
    47 Further, I do not consider that a lesser sentence is warranted for the criminal conduct involved, bearing in mind all that can be said in terms of the subjective features of the offender.  
     
      
    48 I propose that the Court make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal the sentence, imposed by his Honour Judge Knox SC on the applicant on 23 March 2009, be granted; 
       
       
      (ii) Appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 CAMPBELL JA: I agree with Rothman J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: I agree with Rothman J. 
     
      
    3 ROTHMAN J: FS, the applicant, seeks leave to appeal against the sentence imposed upon him by the District Court on 12 August 2008. FS pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess a commercial quantity of a border-controlled substance, namely cocaine. The maximum penalty for such an offence is life imprisonment, or a fine of $825,000, or both. FS was sentenced to 12 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 8 years. This judgment refers to the applicant by initials only on account of his role in giving assistance to authorities and the precarious position that may arise therefrom, particularly while in prison.  
     
      
    4 The sentence imposed by the District Court was calculated from a starting point of 20 years’ imprisonment, applying a discount of 40% for the combined effect of the early plea of guilty and past and future assistance. The discount for the plea of guilty was assessed at 25% and future assistance was assessed at 5%.  
     
      
    5 FS raises two grounds of appeal:  
     
      
       
      (1) An alleged misapplication of principles relating to “discounts” for assistance to law enforcement and prosecuting authorities and a failure to provide an adequate discount for past and future assistance to such authorities; and 
       
       
      (2) That the sentencing discretion miscarried because events subsequent to the sentence being imposed established that the assistance provided was more valuable than was initially appreciated.  
       
      
    Facts 
     
      
    6 The parties provided the sentencing judge with a statement of agreed facts and the accused’s statement was tendered. The accused’s statement was not tendered as evidence of the facts therein, but only as evidence of the level of assistance provided by him. The facts are, as is not unusual with conspiracy charges, lengthy and complicated and outline the entire course of the investigation by the Australian Customs Service and the Australian Federal Police, together with the involvement of each of the alleged co-conspirators. The Crown have summarised the facts, not unfairly, in the following way (but the names and other identifying aspects have been altered): 
     
      
       
        
        “5. On 20 March 2007 a shipping container arrived in Sydney from [country withheld]. Within the container were 946 boxes of [cargo]. The bill of lading noted the consigner was: ‘[ABC Consigner]’ (“[ABC]”) and the consignee was stated as: ‘[ 
        Alpha Co 
        ], 
          
        [ 
        address withheld 
        ],  
        Attn: [Mr Black]  
        [ 
        mobile number withheld 
        ]’. AFP enquiries later revealed that no business named ‘[Alpha Co]’ existed.  
         
         
        6. On 20 April 2007 an e-mail was sent from [ABC] to customs brokers, ‘[XYZ] International’ (“[XYC]”). The e-mail enquired about the container that had earlier arrived but which had not yet been delivered to [Alpha Co]. Thereafter, between 21 April and 3 May 2007, numerous e-mails were sent between [ABC] and [XYZ] regarding the paperwork and storage for the container and the costs to be paid for the container to be released. After payment had been received, [XYZ] subsequently arranged for Customs clearance of the container.  
         
         
        7. On 10 May 2007, [Mr Black] sent a facsimile to [ABC] requesting delivery of the container to ‘[Beta] Pty Ltd’ of [address withheld]. AFP enquiries revealed that the business [Beta] Pty Ltd was registered as ‘retail and importers of [xxxxxxx] products’. Further AFP enquiries revealed that the business ‘[Gamma] Shipping Pty Ltd’ (“[Gamma]”) had premises at [address withheld], adjacent to [Beta] Pty Ltd.  
         
         
        8. On 14 May 2007, [ABC] contacted the ACS hotline to report the details of the container. The ACS was advised that the container had been sitting on the wharf since March and had not yet been delivered. The ACS was further advised that storage costs of $27,000 were unpaid, yet the declared value of the goods was only $6,000. [ABC] advised that they had been informed that [Mr Black] had advised that payment of the costs would be handled by ‘[Mr Pink]’ from [123] Lawyers (ie. [Mr Pink] – the principal of [123] Lawyers).  
         
         
        9. The container was subsequently delivered to the premises of [Gamma]. On 15 May 2007, a person identifying themselves as ‘[Mr Brown]’ contacted [ABC] and made arrangements for the collection of the container from Gamma and its further delivery to ‘Kennards Hire’ at [suburb withheld, under the contact name ‘[Mr Blue]’. Subsequent AFP enquiries revealed that on 12 May 2007, storage unit no. [xxxx] at Kennards Hire, [suburb withheld], had been rented in the business name ‘[Delta] Pty Ltd’, with the contact name of [Mr Blue]. 
         
         
        10. Later on 15 May 2007, AFP members executed a search warrant at [Gamma] and seized the shipping container. Subsequent forensic examinations of the goods within the container revealed a pure quantity of 28.399kg of cocaine had been concealed within the rims of 21 of the [units of cargo]. The cocaine was seized by the AFP and 21 substitute [units of cargo] were placed in the container.  
         
         
        11. On 17 May 2007, [Mr Blue] telephoned [Mr White] and in coded language discussed leaving the container in the storage facility for a week as it was ‘ 
        hot 
        ’. In a further telephone conversation that day they discussed delivery of the container to ‘ 
        hotel room xxxx 
        ’ (ie. The Kennards unit at [suburb withheld]) under the name [Mr Black]. During this further conversation the Applicant replaced [Mr Blue] on the telephone and spoke to [Mr White]. [Mr White] advised that the delivery name should be changed to [Mr Blue]. They agreed that [Mr Pink] would contact the customs broker to make the arrangements.  
         
         
        12. [Mr White] subsequently telephoned [Mr Pink] to discuss the change of delivery name from [Mr Black] to [Mr Blue]. [Mr Pink] in turn contacted [ABC] to discuss the new delivery arrangements. He requested that the container be held for a further seven days. In subsequent telephone calls, [Mr White] and [Mr Pink] discussed who would pay for the further container storage costs. [Mr Pink] stated that the [suppliers] should pay.  
         
         
        13. On 17 May 2007 the shipping container, with the substituted [cargo], was delivered to Kennards Hire at [suburb withheld]. The container was left within the fenced compound of the premises. On the same day, [Mr Blue] was in frequent contact with the other syndicate members regarding the transport and unpacking arrangements for the container.  
         
         
        14. Later on 17 May 2007, [Mr Pink] contacted [Mr White] and they had a coded telephone conversation in which they discussed arrangements for unpacking the container. After this call, [Mr Blue] called the Applicant and in a coded conversation advised that ‘ 
        they are going to pick up the stuff 
        ’.  
         
         
        15. On 19 May 2007, a truck attended at Kennards Hire, [suburb withheld] to collect the container. The AFP conducted surveillance on the truck as it conveyed the container to a location along [location withheld]. The container was left then at the side of the road. During the transporting of the container and its delivery at [location withheld], AFP observed the Applicant and a number of other syndicate members in the vicinity of the container.  
         
         
        16. After the container had been delivered an unknown male was seen placing a sign on the side of the container which read: ‘ 
        For sale [cargo] $25 each 
        ’. During this time AFP surveillance members were filming these activities. Shortly after, the Applicant contacted [Mr White] and advised ‘ 
        the Federals are here 
        ’. He then spoke in code with [Mr White] and repeatedly instructed him ‘ 
        not to open it 
        ’.  
         
         
        17. In a number of further telephone calls that day, the Applicant again repeatedly warned [Mr White] not to open the container. The Applicant further advised that he had ‘ 
        seen them taking photos 
        ’.  
         
         
        18. Later in the afternoon on 19 May 2007, [Mr Pink] called [Mr White] to advise that he had been contacted by the council and that the container had to be moved by 12 o’clock tomorrow. In a further conversation that day [Mr White] advised [Mr Pink] that the container was ‘ 
        hot 
        ’ and that they were being watched.  
         
         
        19. On 20 May 2007, arrangements were made for the container to be collected from the [location withheld] location and to be stored at a safe location. Subsequently, the Applicant spoke to [Mr Grey] and asked to meet him in half an hour as ‘ 
        it’s urgent 
        ’.  
         
         
        20. On 21 May 2007, the Applicant and [Mr White] had a telephone conversation in which they discussed the situation.  
         
         
        21. On 22 May 2007, the Applicant departed Australia on-board a United Airlines flight [overseas]. The Applicant then travelled on to [country withheld].  
         
         
        22. On 23 May 2007, the Applicant’s partner, [Ms Yellow], spoke to [Mr White] by telephone and advised that the Applicant was on his way to ‘ 
        the origin 
        ’ to speak to ‘ 
        them 
        ’. A short time later that day, [Mr White] again spoke to [Ms Yellow] in a further telephone conversation. [Ms Yellow] advised that the Applicant would contact her the following morning and provide instructions from the people at the origin.  
         
         
        23. On 24 May 2007, the Applicant called [Ms Yellow] from an overseas telephone number. He advised that he had not yet been able to speak to the right people to find out what to do. [Ms Yellow] told the Applicant to tell ‘ 
        them 
        ’ to send the ‘ 
        stuff 
        ’ back and ‘ 
        I think you should return the shit before it gets worse 
        ’. [Ms Yellow] suggested that the Applicant should tell the people to start again from zero and to ‘ 
        send it a different way 
        ’ using a new company and different people because the people ‘ 
        ended up being very incompetent 
        ’.  
         
         
        24. On 26 May 2007, Mr White called [Mr Green]. [Mr Green] stated ‘ 
        He’s coming…the owner of the equipment is coming with him…it seems he’s fixed everything 
        ’.  
         
         
        25. On 27 May 2007, the Applicant returned to Australia. After his arrival he contacted [Mr White] by telephone and advised ‘ 
        …everything is fine…back to zero…you can relax 
        .’ 
         
         
        26. After May 2007, another group of persons, not involving the Applicant, was actively involved in the arrangements concerning [the] container. These people included [Mr Orange] who arrived in Australia on 22 June 2007.  
         
         
        27. Throughout June and July 2007 various arrangements were made by these other persons to have the container delivered to another location. Eventually, on 11 July 2007, the container was delivered to ‘Storage Plus’ at [address withheld], with the contact name [Mr Red]. Earlier, on 6 July 2007, storage unit [xxxxxx] at Storage Plus had been rented in the name of [Mr Red]. Subsequent AFP enquiries indicated that [Mr Red] was in fact [Mr Purple].  
         
         
        28. After the container had been delivered to Storage Plus a group of men was seen to attend the vicinity of unit [xxxxxx] and to unpack the contents of the container, transferring the [cargo] into the unit.  
         
         
        29. On 12 July 2007, [Mr Green], [Mr Purple] and [Mr Orange] attended unit [xxxxxx] at Storage Plus, where they examined the [cargo] and then began to smash some of them open. A short time late the AFP arrested the men as they attempted to leave the storage unit.  
         
         
        30. Later on 12 July 2007, the AFP arrested the Applicant. During subsequent searches of the Applicant’s home and car, police located: 
         
          
           
            An A4 page containing photocopied photographs of a [cargo] (similar to the ones in which the cocaine was concealed); 
            A Kennards self storage receipt; 
            5 mobile phones 
            A set of scales 
            Freight forwarding documents relating to the container of flower pots 
            Trading Post confirmation for an advertisement for the sale of ‘[cargo]’; 
            A handwritten note containing the words: ‘I [name withheld] (ind)…Authorisation Broker to take the container to another Destination’ and ‘[XYZ]’.” 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    Ground 1: Discount for Assistance  
     
      
    7 As earlier stated, his Honour calculated the sentence imposed by a commencement point of 20 years’ imprisonment and applied a discount of 40% for the combined effect of the early plea of guilty and assistance to authorities. No issue is taken with the commencement point of 20 years by either the Crown or by FS. Further, no issue is taken that an appropriate discount for the considerable utilitarian value of the early plea of guilty was 25%: see R v Thomson and Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; (2000) 49 NSWLR 383, which, while it is a guideline judgment in relation to New South Wales offences, is a useful guide for sentencing for Commonwealth offences: R v Bugeja [2001] NSWCCA 196. The range of discount used as a guide, even in Commonwealth offences, is between 10% and 25% and the discount assessed by the District Court in this matter is at the highest end of that range. As stated, no issue is taken with this level of discount.  
     
      
    8 The issue raised by this ground of appeal is essentially the appropriate principle and the guidelines for the assessment of a proper discount for assistance given to law enforcement agencies. Related to that issue, at least as the Crown seeks to counter the submission of the applicant, is the proper assessment of the assistance given and the manner in which his Honour the sentencing judge treated the value of the assistance. It is necessary to repeat some part of his Honour’s remarks on sentence. His Honour said, in dealing with the observation that some aspects of the statements FS had made to police may not have been truthful: 
     
      
       
        
        “It does not take much imagination to conclude that this will provide fertile ground for cross-examination in the hearing of the two co-conspirators. Such an observation and the basis for it, means that [FS’] evidence, if it be given, will be of diminished value. In that respect I was referred by the Crown to  
        Vasqez Felipi v The Queen 
         167 A Crim R 231. I was referred to the decision of Howie J in The Queen v Sukka [sic] (2006) 172 A Crim R 151 at para 5, where his Honour said that, 
         
         
          
           
          ‘discounts for a plea and assistance of more than 40% should be very exceptionally, if at all, granted in a case where there is no evidence that the offender will spend the sentence, or a substantial part of it, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population.’ 
          
         
         
        The standard deduction is 40% unless there are exceptional circumstances and they should be, ‘very exceptionally’ [sic]. The condition of the offender’s imprisonment was described …. He is held under tight security in a special purposes prison. He is isolated from other prisoners and now, at this early stage of incarceration, he has maximum restrictions which will be gradually reduced, but never reduced beyond serious restrictions.  
         
         
        [FS] is in a quite dangerous situation because of his willingness to give evidence against his co-conspirators. His partner has fled overseas with their son, and they are, in his estimation, in quite considerable danger because such syndicates as this Mexico cartel have a strong reputation for violence, for threats and carrying out threats. The police officer agreed that the offender has good reasons to fear for his life, and the life of his partner and son. … 
         
         
        A similar pattern of incarceration emerges from the letter of Reverend Peter Bain (exhibit 2), a chaplain for eleven years, who said that he found the conditions under which [FS] is kept to be more claustrophobic than he had previously experienced in any other centre, that in the particular wing in which he is held, it is not possible to visit the men in their living space, 
         
         
          
           
          ‘Inmates housed in this particular wing have in the past had their education put on hold due to difficulty of access to education. The gym area is no larger than bedroom.’ 
          
         
         
        There is no doubt that he will be held in difficult conditions.” 
        
       
      
    9 His Honour then dealt with the factors that his Honour took into account in assessing the level of discount and listed: the offender’s early plea of guilty; the limited expressions of remorse (which his Honour said would not be given “any much weight”); the assistance which the offender has offered, “but which is judged ‘medium’ (and [the judge] consider[s] that to be placed at a rather high level); and also that he is going to be kept in isolation …, kept in high security with good reasons for fear for his own safety”. On the basis of the foregoing, his Honour considered that “there should be an overall reduction in his sentence of 40%, of which [the judge] consider[s] that 5% would relate to any future assistance offered pursuant to s 21B.” [The reference to s 21B seems to have been intended to be a reference to s 21E of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) (“the Act”).] 
     
      
    10 It is strictly unnecessary to specify the total discount for assistance or, as it is usually expressed, for assistance and the plea of guilty. It is necessary, pursuant to the terms of s 21E of the Act, to specify the amount by which a sentence or non-parole period is to be reduced in order to take account of an undertaking by the offender to cooperate with law enforcement agencies in proceedings, i.e. future assistance.  
     
      
    11 There is more than one method by which an appropriate sentence can be derived and the method adopted by a sentencing judge will depend upon the circumstances of the offence and the offender. The discount for assistance has often been the catalyst for the expression of the difference of approach between intuitive synthesis and a more mathematical approach: see Markarian v R [2005] HCA 25; (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 375 [39]; AB v R (1999) HCA 46; [1999] 198 CLR 111; Wong v R [2001] HCA 64; (2001) 207 CLR 584 at 611-612.  
     
      
    12 It is not inconsistent with an intuitive synthesis for a sentencing judge to specify the amount of discount for the utilitarian value for a plea of guilty and the level of assistance to law enforcement authorities, and to specify, as did the sentencing judge on this occasion, the particular value of future assistance as is required under s 21E of the Act.  That, of course, depends upon the proposition that the process does not become or amount to a two-stage process of the kind to which the High Court referred in Wong, supra, by which the Court assesses, for example, the “objective” sentence and then adjusts that sentence by some mathematical value for each of a number of features including perhaps the subjective elements of an offender. The Court is required to take account of a guilty plea and the degree of assistance to law enforcement agencies (s 16A(2)(g) and (h) of the Act), and these may, if granted, be deducted from the sentence that would otherwise be imposed and which is derived by intuitive synthesis.  
     
      
    13 Discount for the plea of guilty in a Commonwealth offence is for the willingness to facilitate the course of justice: Cameron v R [2002] HCA 6; (2002) 209 CLR 339 at [19]. It does not include issues such as remorse that may be evidenced by the plea. It should still be assessed in the range of 10% to 25% and the range is still determined by the timing of the plea: Cameron, supra.  
     
      
    14 Assistance to authorities in the prosecution of offences is a public benefit and a public duty. Nevertheless, in the sentencing process, leniency is extended to offenders for assistance to authorities. It is not an uncommon practice. That leniency takes into account a number of factors, which were summarised in the High Court in the following manner: 
     
      
       
        
        “[3] It is common sentencing practice to extend leniency, sometimes very substantial leniency, to an offender who has assisted the authorities, and, in so doing, to take account of any threat to the offender's safety, the conditions under which the offender will have to serve a sentence in order to reduce the risk of reprisals, and the steps that will need to be taken to protect the offender when released. The relevant principles are discussed, for example, in  
        R v Cartwright 
         (1989) 17 NSWLR 243 and  
        R v Gallagher  
        (1991) 23 NSWLR 220. Atkinson J gave the appellant credit for her assistance to the authorities, her early plea of guilty, and other personal factors of no present relevance, in a combination of two ways. She imposed a lesser term of imprisonment than would otherwise have been the case (but not lesser to an extent that she considered would of itself fully recognise such factors), and she suspended the sentence. Her reasoning made it clear that, if she had not suspended the sentence, she would have fixed a shorter term of imprisonment.” ( 
        York v R  
        [2005] HCA 60; (2005) 225 CLR 466; (2005) 79 ALJR 1919 per Gleeson CJ.) 
        
       
      
    15 His Honour Chief Justice Gleeson referred, after the passage cited immediately above, to two judgments of the Court of Criminal Appeal that discuss the relevant principles. In one of them, R v Gallagher (1991) 23 NSWLR 220, Gleeson CJ observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Those last-mentioned matters may, depending upon the circumstances, be very difficult to separate from other considerations which might arise quite apart from the matter of assistance to the authorities. In this case, for example, the appellant was entitled to receive, and received, credit for pleading guilty, and for the contrition which that plea of guilty reflected. It was also said to be to his credit that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. It seems hardly likely that these were subjective matters which were entirely separate from the matter of his assistance to the authorities. It must often be the case that an offender's conduct in pleading guilty, his expressions of contrition, his willingness to co- operate with the authorities, and the personal risks to which he thereby exposes himself, will form a complex of inter-related considerations, and an attempt to separate out one or more of those considerations will not only be artificial and contrived, but will also be illogical.” 
        
       
      
    16 The calculation of the amount of any such discount has developed over the last decade. Thus, in R v Pang [1999] NSWCCA 4; (1999) 105 A Crim R 474, Wood CJ at CL with whom Meagher JA and Barr J agreed, observed that: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no fixed tariff for the reduction that should be given for assistance, and so far no guideline judgment has been delivered in this area. However, the discount customarily given in this State for assistance, has ranged between 20 and 50 percent of the sentence that would otherwise have been imposed.”  
        
       
      
    It should be pointed out, that the reference to percentage discounts for assistance is a reference to a combined percentage discount for both assistance and the utilitarian value for the plea of guilty associated with it: see R v M [2005] NSWCCA 224, per Buddin J, with whom James J and I agreed.  
     
      
    17 The matters associated with a level of discount were discussed by the Court of Criminal Appeal in SZ v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 19, in which the Court made it clear that a combined discount for pleas of guilty and assistance should not normally exceed 50% and that discounts exceeding 50% should be reserved for very exceptional circumstances.  
     
      
    18 In SZ v Regina, Buddin J, with whom Simpson J and Howie J agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[52] I acknowledge, as did Latham J in  
        Sukkar 
         (supra), that there will be cases in which a combined or composite discount of more than 50% is called for. There may well be a case in which the assistance proffered is of a quite extraordinary kind. Alternatively there may be a case in which the offender is entitled to an additional discount, in accordance with the principles enunciated in  
        R v Ellis 
         (1986) 6 NSWLR 603, on account of having disclosed information which was otherwise unknown to the authorities. Indeed, composite discounts in excess of 50% have been allowed on several occasions when this Court has proceeded to re-sentence following a successful appeal by an offender. See, for example,  
        R v NP 
         (supra);  
        R v OPA 
         [2004] NSWCCA 464 and  
        R v AMT 
         [2005] NSWCCA 151. 
         
         
        [53] However, in light of the authorities to which I have referred and particularly given the statutory mandate contained in s 23(3) of the Act, it is my opinion that a combined discount exceeding 50% should be reserved for an exceptional case. Counsel for the applicant went so far as to suggest that a combined discount of 75%, comprising a discount of 25% for the plea of guilty to which would be added a further 50% for assistance to authorities, may be available in an appropriate case. In view of the matters to which I have referred, I regard such a submission as being simply untenable. Apart from any other consideration, the aggregation of discrete discounts is at odds with the observations of Gleeson CJ in  
        Gallagher 
         (supra) which are recited in the extract from  
        El Hani 
         (supra) which appears at par 31 of this judgment. See also  
        R v NP  
        (supra) at pars 30 and 47.” 
        
       
      
    19 In the same judgment, in separate comments agreeing with Buddin J, Howie J said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[7] Counsel for the applicant argued that a proper application of both the guideline in  
        Thomson and Houlton 
         as to the effect of the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty and the acknowledged range of the discount available for assistance meant that it was legitimate in an appropriate case to discount a sentence by up to 75 per cent. It was argued that, as the discount for the plea and the discount for assistance reflect two different policies and did not overlap, because the utilitarian value of the plea had nothing to do with contrition, the court should give them both their full effect. But the argument simply overlooks the fact that it is impossible to see how a sentence that is only 25 per cent of what would otherwise be appropriate could not be ‘unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence’. 
         
         
        [8] I accept that what is ‘unreasonably disproportionate’ is not simply determined by the objective facts of the offence and has to take into account matters such as the threat posed to the offender by reason of the assistance given and the nature and extent of the assistance:  
        R v C 
         (1994) 75 A Crim R 309. But this does not relieve the judge from the primary task of imposing a sentence that reflects the objective circumstances of the offence:  
        R v WHS 
         (NSWCCA, unreported, 27 March 1995). The decision in  
        York v R  
        [2005] HCA 60; (2005) 221 ALR 541 does not suggest otherwise.” 
        
       
      
    20 It is with those principles in mind that one must analyse the comments of the sentencing judge as to the deduction that has been applied in this case. Citing, as he did, the comments of Howie J in R v Sukkar [2006] NSWCCA 92; (2006) 172 A Crim R 151, which citation is referred to at [8] above, his Honour the sentencing judge referred to a “standard deduction” of 40%, unless there were exceptional circumstances. Such a statement does not emerge from the principle espoused by Howie J in Sukkar.  
     
      
    21 There are two quite distinct circumstances that arise. The first is a circumstance where the offender will spend the sentence, or a substantial part of the sentence, in more onerous conditions than the general prison population. The second circumstance is where the offender will not suffer more onerous conditions of imprisonment for a substantial portion of the term of imprisonment. In the latter case, unless one can show exceptional circumstances, the reduction for the plea of guilty and assistance should be no more than 40%. In the earlier case (i.e. where there will be more onerous conditions of imprisonment) the 40% figure is inapplicable. In the latter situation the reduction for the plea of guilty and assistance is no more than 50%, unless very exceptional circumstances are disclosed. Onerous conditions of imprisonment are not exceptional circumstances. They are often a corollary of the assistance granted.  
     
      
    22 Moreover, there is no “standard deduction”. There is a percentage deduction to obtain a result, below which sentencing judges should not reduce a sentence, unless there are exceptional, or very exceptional, circumstances, because, inter alia, a “discount” of such magnitude would usually take the sentence to a level lower than could properly reflect the objective circumstances of the offence.  
     
      
    23 The Crown submits that, understood as a whole, the learned sentencing judge was not departing from the principles already espoused and was not laying down a principle. There are two answers to that submission. Firstly, in order for the submission to be tenable, it requires the Court to adopt a view that onerous conditions in prison are an exceptional circumstance, within the principles laid down by Howie J in Sukkar. They are not. The onerous conditions determine into which category the offender falls for the purpose of calculating the non-exceptional upper limit for assistance.  
     
      
    24 Secondly, the submission of the Crown depends, alternatively, upon an acceptance that his Honour the sentencing judge took the view that the assistance was of diminished value because of the inconsistency in statements by the applicant. The difficulty in that approach is that there is a tension between the comments of the sentencing judge at one part of his remarks (namely, the reference to his evidence being of “diminished value” (see [8] above) because of inconsistent versions) and his acceptance that the assistance was of “medium” value in another part of the sentence. Ultimately, the process of sentencing, particularly in this area, requires clarity, or as much as can be displayed. The tension between the two comments of his Honour, the sentencing judge, undermines that transparency and the Court is unable to determine precisely what value his Honour put on the assistance.  
     
      
    25 In my opinion, his Honour has either misunderstood or misapplied the principles set out by Howie J in Sukkar, and has unduly and inappropriately constrained the exercise of discretion available to his Honour in determining the level of discount for the plea of guilty and assistance provided.  
     
      
    26 Having come to that conclusion, the Court is capable of dealing with the task of re-sentencing and assess the discount on the basis of the additional material provided as to the utility and value of the assistance, which has now been assessed, by the law enforcement agencies, as high. With that assessment I agree.  
     
      
    27 I would not interfere with the commencement point for the sentence of 20 years’ imprisonment. As a consequence, given the findings, also unchallenged, as to the more onerous conditions that the applicant will suffer in prison, I consider that an appropriate discount, for the plea of guilty and assistance to law enforcement agencies, is 50%. Most of the assistance is now in the past, but there is more to be given that is qualitatively important. I assess future assistance under s 21E of the Act at 10% (i.e. one-fifth of the total reduction). 
     
      
    Ground 2: Erroneous Calculation of the Value of Assistance 
     
      
    28 As a consequence of the foregoing finding of error, and the redetermination of the value of the plea of guilty and assistance, this ground of appeal falls away. So much was conceded by counsel for the applicant, and by the Crown. The ground seeks ex post facto to show error in the judge’s assessment of the value of assistance, inter alia, by evidence of a greater incidence of testimony by the applicant and of its use. 
     
      
    29 To the extent that the ground of appeal was supported, by the submission that the value of the assistance provided depended upon the number of times that an offender was required to give evidence, there are fundamental flaws in such a proposition.  
     
      
    30 A sentencing judge is required to assess the value of assistance given and future assistance to be given. For that purpose, the judge is entitled to take into account, as accurately as evidence allows at the time that the assessment is made, that adherence to the offender’s statement of assistance is required and departure from the statement, or from the undertaking to give assistance, may have repercussions, should an appeal by the Crown be instigated. But the value of assistance is not undermined by an ex post facto realisation that evidence has been required to be given more often, or less often, than was originally appreciated. Nor does an eventual realisation (unavailable at the time of the sentence), that the assistance is of greater significance, result in error, or the capacity to quash the sentence on appeal.  
     
      
    31 As earlier stated, it is unnecessary to deal to finality, or more fully, with this ground of appeal.  
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    32 For the foregoing reasons, the sentencing judge either misunderstood, or misapplied, the principles that determine an appropriate assessment for a plea of guilty and assistance to law enforcement agencies. Applying the principles appropriately, the applicant ought to have received a discount of 50% for the plea of guilty and the aforesaid assistance. The 50% discount does not take the sentence, to be imposed, below that which is proportionate to the criminality involved, taking into account the particular aspects of this offence and this offender. I am satisfied that a lesser sentence is warranted.  
     
      
    33 I propose that the Court make the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal the sentence, imposed in this matter, on 12 August 2008, be granted; 
       
       
      (ii) The sentence imposed by the District Court on 12 August 2008, in this matter, be quashed; 
       
       
      (iii) In lieu of the sentence imposed, the applicant be sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 10 years, with a non-parole period of 6 years and 8 months, commencing 12 July 2007 and expiring on 11 March 2014. The applicant is first eligible for release on 11 March 2014.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: By a third further amended statement of claim filed in Court during the course of the hearing, the plaintiffs claim a total sum of $5,250,000 plus interest, in accordance with s 100 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005, for moneys which they claim the defendants have received, but have refused and/or failed to repay. This sum comprises: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1 $3,650,000, which the plaintiffs claim Mr Harry Kakavas, the first defendant, received from the second plaintiff, Crackers Corporation Pty Limited ('Crackers Corporation') 
         
         
        2 $600,000 which the plaintiffs claim Mr Kakavas received from the first plaintiff, Coastline Constructions Pty Limited ('Coastline Constructions'). 
         
         
        3 $1,000,000 for which the plaintiffs claim the three defendants are jointly and severally liable to Crackers Corporation. 
        
       
       
      
    2 By a cross claim filed in August of 2008, Mr Kakavas claims damages, including aggravated and exemplary damages, from Mr McCracken in respect of an assault, as well as judgment in the sum of $750,000 in respect of moneys allegedly paid to Mr McCracken as the result of that assault. 
     
      
    3 The proceedings arise out of events which began in 2006. They concern factually complicated claims and counter claims. The plaintiffs allege that they resulted in three agreements. The existence of two of the agreements was not in dispute. The third agreement was denied and instead, it was claimed that an entirely different agreement had been made. As to the cross claim, it was not in dispute that Mr McCracken assaulted Mr Kakavas on 10 November 2006, but that it was the assault which led Mr Kakavas to make the $1 million payment he pursues by his cross claim, is denied. It is not in issue that Mr McCracken’s wife received $1 million paid in three instalments by Mr Kerwick, the second defendant, which was funded by Mr Kakavas. Mr Kakavas seeks repayment of $750,000 of that sum from Mr McCracken. What the payment was for, is in dispute. The defendants deny that it was in repayment of $2 million given by Mr McCracken to Mr Kerwick under the third agreement and wrongly paid for Mr Kakavas’ benefit, by Mr Pilarinos, the third defendant, to whom Mr Kerwick paid the money. 
     
      
    4 While the various payments sought to be recovered were made by the corporate plaintiffs, there is no claim that they were ever parties to any of the three agreements on which the plaintiffs rely. Those payments were all made on Mr McCracken’s behalf. 
     
      
       
      The second agreement 
       
      
    5 It is convenient to begin with the second agreement, which was made between Mr Kakavas and Mr McCracken in October 2006. It is not in dispute that Mr McCracken agreed to loan Mr Kakavas $500,000, in order that Mr Kakavas could lay a bet on a football game. The money was due to be repaid by the end of October. Mr McCracken claims that $250,000 of that debt remains outstanding. Mr Kakavas claims that $250,000 of the $1 million paid to Mrs McCracken, should be treated as having repaid this debt. 
     
      
       
      The first agreement 
       
      
    6 Mr Kakavas was the sole director, secretary and shareholder of Elite Property Investment Group Pty Limited ('Elite'), which was the owner of a commercial property at Broadbeach in Queensland. At the time of the hearing Elite was in administration. It was not a party to the proceedings. It was common ground that in June 2006, over a lunch attended by Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas, it was agreed that Mr McCracken, or his nominee, would buy this property from Elite.  
     
      
    7 There was no claim that Mr Kakavas was a party to this oral agreement. It was common ground that particulars of the agreement included: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (a) Elite would sell and McCracken, or his nominated entity, would purchase the Broadbeach property. 
         
         
        (b) The purchase price was $14,000,000.00. 
         
         
        (c) Kakavas would have a formal Contract for Sale prepared in respect of the Broadbeach property. 
        
       
       
      
    8 The fourth term was claimed to be: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (d) McCracken would pay to Kakavas $4,000,000 to be applied by way of deposit or purchase moneys in respect of the purchase upon the preparation and exchange of the formal Contract for Sale.  
        
       
       
      
    9 It was common ground that $4 million was paid in instalments to Mr Kakavas, as Mr McCracken explained it, in dribs and drabs by both Coastline Constructions and Crackers Corporation, before written contracts were exchanged. Mr McCracken’s evidence was that he understood that the money would be used for refurbishment work underway on the building. Mr Kakavas’ evidence was that Mr McCracken knew that he used the money to gamble with. It was also common ground that it was agreed that the settlement was to be delayed until January 2007, when Elite’s mortgage on the property fell due for repayment. 
     
      
    10 A written sale agreement was later prepared on Mr Kakavas’ instructions by Ramsden Fae solicitors. There was a dispute as to some of the terms of that written agreement and whether it was ever signed. Neither Mr Kakavas nor Mr McCracken retained a copy of this document, but it was common ground that contracts were never exchanged and that the sale did not proceed. There is also a dispute as to whether that outcome was brought about by Mr McCracken, or Mr by Kakavas. 
     
      
    11 Mr Kakavas' case was that neither he nor Elite had any obligation to repay the $4 million deposit which had been paid, but that he had personally repaid $1 million of the deposit, under duress after the assault. Mr McCracken claims that this was a repayment made in respect of the third agreement. By his cross claim Mr Kakavas claims that apart from $250,000, the balance should be repaid to him.  
     
      
       
      The third agreement 
       
      
    12 The plaintiffs' claim that there was a third oral agreement made between Mr McCracken and the three defendants in October 2006, which all three defendants deny.  
     
      
    13 This agreement is alleged to have contained a number of elements. Firstly, Mr Kerwick was to purchase a Queensland property from Mr Pilarinos, the third defendant. Secondly, Mr Pilarinos was to purchase Mr McCracken’s family home where he lived with his wife and children. Thirdly, Mr McCracken was to advance $2 million to Mr Kerwick, to be used as the deposit on his purchase from Mr Pilarinos. Fourthly, Mr Pilarinos was to repay that deposit to Mr Kerwick, who would then repay Mr McCracken, if Mr Pilarinos did not obtain finance for his purchase of Mr McCracken’s home. Fifthly, Mr Kakavas would act as agent on the two sales and would guarantee that they would proceed, and that if they did not proceed, that the $2 million advanced by Mr McCracken to Mr Kerwick, would be refunded to Mr McCracken.  
     
      
    14 Mr McCracken claimed that Mr Pilarinos did not obtain finance for his purchase. Instead of then repaying the $2 million deposit to Mr Kerwick, in order that it could be repaid to Mr McCracken, Mr Pilarinos paid it to Mr Kakavas, who lost the money gambling. 
     
      
    15 There is no question that Mr McCracken paid Mr Kerwick $2 million. Mr Kerwick and Mr Kakavas claim that this payment was made in respect of another transaction entirely, namely an agreement between Mr McCracken and Mr Kerwick, that Mr Kerwick would sell a property which he owned, situated at Palm Beach Queensland, to Mr McCracken. Mr McCracken denies that there was any such agreement ever discussed or agreed. 
     
      
    16 There is also no question that Mr Kerwick paid Mr Pilarinos $2 million, but they claim that this was not a payment made under the third agreement. Their case is that Mr Kerwick paid Mr Pilarinos $2 million, in order to repay a debt of $800,000 and to make a $1.2 million investment in an $80 million property development which Mr Pilarinos had underway in Melbourne. Neither of these transactions were documented. They, too, were oral agreements, Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos claimed. 
     
      
    17 Mr Pilarinos did not seek any finance to purchase Mr McCracken's house. His case was that he never intended, or even discussed with Mr McCracken buying his family home. Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos also claim that they never agreed that Mr Kerwick would purchase any property from Mr Pilarinos. Mr Kakavas claims that he never agreed to act as agent in respect of such sales. 
     
      
    18 It was Mr Pilarinos and Mr Kakavas’ case that Mr Pilarinos loaned Mr Kakavas over $4 million for gambling and that these loans had nothing to do with the third agreement, or the $2 million given to Mr Pilarinos by Mr Kerwick, which he had received from Mr McCracken. There is no question that Mr Pilarinos did not repay $2 million to Mr Kerwick. He later paid Mr Kerwick $300,000, he and Mr Kerwick claim, when Mr Kerwick wanted part of the $2 million he had invested with Mr Pilarinos for other purposes. 
     
      
       
      The assault and payment of $1 million 
       
      
    19 As to Mr Kakavas’ cross claim, there is no issue that at around midday on 10 November 2006, Mr McCracken met with Mr Kakavas at his home, and that Mr McCracken then assaulted Mr Kakavas. This was Mr Kakavas’ wedding day. Mr Kakavas claims that Mr McCracken subsequently made threats that he would cause Mr Kakavas and his father harm, if he did not repay Mr McCracken $6,250,000. Mr Pilarinos and Mr Kerwick conveyed these threats to Mr Kakavas, as did another mutual friend, Mr Chrysaffis. While Mr McCracken does not deny the argument and the assault, he denies making such threats or claiming such payment. On his case, he only then wanted $2 million repaid. 
     
      
    20 On 11 November 2006, Mr Kakavas signed a document which he had handwritten, acknowledging that he owed Mr McCracken $6,250,000. Mr Kakavas claims that this document was not signed voluntarily, but that it was in terms dictated by Mr McCracken and that Mr Chrysaffis conveyed those terms to him, together with threats to his safety and that of his father. He signed the document and subsequently paid Mrs McCracken $1 million, through Mr Kerwick, money which he did not owe Mr McCracken, other than $250,000, as a result of his fear of Mr McCracken. Mr McCracken denies that he obtained the document by these means. While he had asked for an acknowledgement, he did not extract it by threats and did not dictate the terms in which it was given. He understood that the payment was made in relation to the $2 million he had given Mr Kerwick under the third agreement. 
     
      
    21 On Mr McCracken’s case, when Mr Kakavas produced the acknowledgement, he was seeking only repayment of the $2 million owing under the third agreement. The first agreement was then still on foot. Mr Kakavas denies this, claiming that on 10 November, Mr McCracken also told him that he was not proceeding with the first agreement. Mr McCracken was then claiming repayment of $6,250,000 in total. 
     
      
    22 Payments totalling $1 million were made by Mr Kerwick to Mrs McCracken between November 2006 and July 2007. The plaintiffs accept that Mr Kakavas provided these funds to Mr Kerwick. Mr Kakavas claims that he asked Mr Kerwick to pay the money to Mrs McCracken, because of Mr McCracken’s assault, his threats and because he no longer wanted to have any direct dealings with Mr McCracken, after the breakdown of their relationship.  
     
      
    23 Mr Kakavas seeks to recover $750,000 of the payments made by Mr Kerwick, accepting that Mr McCracken is entitled to retain $250,000, that being what he owed him under the second agreement. 
     
      
    24 Mr Kakavas also claims, in the alternative, that in March 2007 another agreement was made with Mr McCracken, that any moneys owed to the plaintiffs would not be payable until judgment or settlement of certain proceedings which he had brought against Crown Casino in the Supreme Court of Victoria, with interest accruing at nine per cent in the meantime. In those proceedings, Mr Kakavas claims Crown Casino owes him in excess of $20 million. Mr McCracken denies that such an agreement was made.  
     
      
       
      The further amendment of the claim  
       
      
    25 After the hearing commenced, it was indicated that the plaintiffs proposed to seek to further amend their claim, in terms then provided to the other parties. Those terms were further refined, while Mr McCracken gave his evidence. At the conclusion of that evidence, leave to further amend was sought and opposed. During the course of the parties’ submissions, those amendments were explained and even further refined. Finally, they were contained in the third further amended statement of claim. The plaintiff was given leave to proceed on those pleadings and I indicated that I would later give reasons for granting that leave.  
     
      
    26 There was no real explanation for the late amendments, other than that there were problems with the pleadings as they stood. That appeared to reflect the unusual circumstances which brought the parties before the Court. 
     
      
    27 There was no issue that very substantial sums of money had passed from the plaintiffs to Mr Kakavas and Mr Kerwick, to Mr Pilarinos and Mr Kakavas and from Mr Kakavas to Mr Kerwick and through him, to Mrs McCracken. There was a very substantial dispute as to what the contractual or other arrangements underpinning those payments were. The plaintiffs undoubtedly paid $6,250,000 in total to Mr Kakavas and Mr Kerwick. They received nothing in return, other than the $250,000 repayment in respect of the second agreement and the $1 million Mr Kerwick paid Mrs McCracken, $750,000 of which Mr Kakavas claims the plaintiffs have no entitlement to. On the defendants’ cases, pursuant to the agreements under which the payments were made, the plaintiffs were entitled to have received nothing in return for the $4 million paid to Mr Kakavas and the $2 million paid to Mr Kerwick. 
     
      
    28 The amendments to the statement of claim sought to ensure that even if it was found that no enforceable agreements of the kind claimed had been made, that the defendants would be ordered to repay what the plaintiffs had paid them, they having no right to retain any of the money they had obtained from the plaintiffs. 
     
      
    29 In considering the parties’ respective cases, I took the view that it could not be overlooked that by the time the hearing commenced, the original statement of claim had already been amended a number of times. The further amendments pressed in relation to Mr Kakavas, in respect of the first agreement, were sought to be pressed on the additional basis, in summary, of: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Unconscionable conduct, resulting in unjust enrichment; in the alternative, damages for converting those moneys to his own use and in the further alternative, as debts due and payable. 
         
        
       
      
    30 The further amendments pressed in relation to the third agreement, in respect of the outstanding sum of $1 million (the plaintiff’s pleadings treating Mr Kerwick’s payment of $1 million to Mrs McCracken as a repayment of the $2 million which he received (allegedly under the third agreement) were, in summary: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Against Mr Kakavas, on the basis of unconscionable conduct, resulting in unjust enrichment and damages for converting those moneys to his own use. 
         
         
        Against Mr Kerwick, on the basis of a debt due and owing and in the further alternative, breach of contract 
         
         
        Against Mr Pilarinos, damages for converting that sum to his own use. 
        
       
       
      
    31 For Mr Pilarinos, in addition to delay and no explanation having been given for the late amendments, it was submitted that the amendments sought would be futile. No action for conversion could be advanced in relation to a money claim as here pressed against him, the Court of Appeal’s judgment in Ferguson v Eakin [1997] NSWCA 106, being binding. There it was held at p 7 that 'there can be no conversion of a chose in action and that monies in a bank account were a chose in action'. 'Conversion must be goods or property capable of possession or being subject to a right of possession'. There was no such right in relation to money in a bank account. The same submission was made for Mr Kakavas. 
     
      
    32 For Mr McCracken, nevertheless, it was argued that leave to amend would be granted, because there was a prospect that this view of the law would be revisited. In Telecom Vanuatu Ltd v Optus Networks Pty Ltd [2005] NSWSC 951, White J had refused to strike out a claim for conversion of intangible property, taking the view, amongst other things, that what must be determined is whether the cause of action is reasonably arguable, depending on whether the Court of Appeal, or High Court, might consider the cause of action viable (at [24]). Reliance was also placed on the observations of Bergin J in Telecom Vanuatu Ltd v Optus Networks Pty Ltd [2008] NSWSC 1209 at [180] - [181]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""180 In  
        Telecom Vanuatu Ltd v Optus Networks Pty Ltd 
         [2005] NSWSC 951, White J declined to strike out TVL’s claim in conversion. However, his Honour did not deal with the merits of the argument and in any event considered that for a Judge at first instance the matter was settled by binding authority. In  
        Hoath v Connect Internet Services Pty Ltd 
         (2006) 229 ALR 566, White J dealt with the issue of conversion of intangible property. In that case the plaintiff alleged that the defendants had committed the tort of conversion by their unauthorised dealings with the domain name “dragon.net.au”. White J regarded  
        Ferguson v Eakin 
         as binding on him and clearly establishing that there could be no claim in conversion or detinue of a chose in action (at 594). His Honour noted that the English Court of Appeal had come to the same conclusion in  
        OBG Ltd v Allan 
         [2005] 2 All ER 602. (Since his Honour delivered his judgment in Hoath the House of Lords dismissed the appeal from the Court of Appeal in  
        OBG 
        : [2007] 4 All ER 545). White J held that the plaintiff had to: identify a chattel embodying the intangible rights with which the defendant interfered; establish that it owned or had an immediate right to possess that chattel; and establish that the defendants dealt with the chattel in a manner repugnant to the plaintiff’s rights. His Honour said (at 597-598):  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Mr Hoath’s right to use the domain name, the IP addresses and the AS number was recorded in an electronic form on the database of the internet registrar. … However, Mr Hoath was never the owner nor did he have a right to possession of the chattel or chattels being, I infer, a hard disk, or a server, or some other piece of computer equipment, on which the information as to his right to use the domain name, IP addresses and AS number was stored. In my view, the defendants did not act in a way which was repugnant to any right which Mr Hoath had to the ownership or possession of a chattel. That is to say, although Spin and Com-Cen’s interference with the internet registrar’s records has deprived Mr Hoath of what I assume is his intangible property, namely the right to use the domain name, the IP addresses and AS number, they have not interfered with his ownership or right to possession of goods. Accordingly, the fiction by which a person may recover damages in conversion for the loss of a chose in action where the defendant has wrongly dealt in a chattel which contains, or, possibly, evidences, the chose, is of no avail to him. It would only be if the law of conversion were extended to dealings in intangible property that Mr Hoath could sustain these causes of action. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        181 In their dissenting opinions in OBG Lord Nicholls and Baroness Hale expressed the view that there was no logical reason why the law should afford a remedy for misappropriation of tangible property but not intangible property. As Lord Nicholls said (at 602): “This distinction makes no sense. It lacks rhyme or reason”."" 
         
        
       
      
    33 It became apparent from the cases which the parties each advanced that the claims and their defence rested on the same facts already pleaded and that if the leave sought was granted, the claims sought to be brought in conversion would, nevertheless, have to be dismissed, it being unarguably the law that no claim in conversion could be pressed in relation to the money here pursued by the plaintiffs. The granting of the leave would thus only preserve any case which the plaintiffs might seek to pursue on appeal. In those circumstances, it seemed to me that no injustice could flow to the defendants in granting the leave sought in relation to the conversion claim. The law was on their side and no additional hearing time, or adjournment, or any other prejudice in the hearing could flow from the grant of the leave. 
     
      
    34 As to the other amendments proposed, it had to be noted that in the original statement of claim filed in 2007, the second and third agreements were not expressly pleaded. Mr Kakavas was then the only defendant. Breach of only the first agreement was alleged. It was claimed that the plaintiffs were the beneficial owners of all of the outstanding $5,250,000; that Mr Kakavas had been unjustly enriched, by failing or refusing to repay the money; in the alternative, that the plaintiffs were entitled to restitution; in the further alternative, that the plaintiffs were entitled to sue Mr Kakavas, for moneys had and received and that Mr Kakavas owed the moneys to the plaintiffs, who sued for that amount. It was Mr Kakavas who raised the second agreement in his defence. 
     
      
    35 In the amended statement of claim filed in May of 2008, Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos were named as defendants. The three agreements now pursued were pleaded. Breaches of the third agreement by Mr Kakavas, Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos were alleged. Against Mr Kakavas $5,250,000 was claimed for moneys had and received. Against Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos, jointly with Mr Kakavas, $1 million was claimed. Unjust enrichment and restitution were not pleaded. 
     
      
    36 The basis of the claims advanced in the second further amended statement of claim, was similar to that advanced in the amended statement of claim and the further amended statement of claim. The various amendments there made went to the details of which of the plaintiffs were entitled to repayment of several of the sums claimed to have been advanced from time to time under the three agreements. In the second further amended statement of claim it was also alleged that Mr Kakavas had converted the $2 million paid under the third agreement, ($1 million of which was later repaid). 
     
      
    37 It followed, as was argued for the defendants, that while the new claims sought to be pursued by the amendments which finally found their way into the third further amended statement of claim, arose out of the same factual matters pleaded in the second further amended statement of claim, new bases were sought to be advanced, for money orders in favour of the plaintiffs, in the event that they failed to establish the existence of the three agreements which they claimed had been breached.  
     
      
    38 The provisions of s 64 of the Civil Procedure Act governed the application for leave to so amend. The application had to be determined in accordance with the requirements of sections 56, 57 and 58 of the Civil Procedure Act, which require that the discretion be exercised in accordance with the dictates of justice and that the overriding purpose of the Act and the Rules, the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings, be facilitated.  
     
      
    39 There was no question that what has always lain at the heart of the plaintiffs' case was that they had advanced various moneys, all of which ended up in the hands of Mr Kakavas, who had no entitlement to retain it and who was bound to repay it, given what had been agreed. Similar claims have been made against the other two defendants.  
     
      
    40 In considering this application and deciding what justice required as between the parties, attention had to be paid to what then had recently been said in Aon Risk Services Australia Limited v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27. There, the High Court took the view that a trial judge had erred in granting an adjournment of a hearing, in circumstances where a substantial amendment to the claim was foreshadowed. The judgment in Queensland v J L Holdings Pty Ltd [1997] HCA 1; (1997) 189 CLR 146, arose for consideration, a decision given before the enactment of the Civil Procedure Act, but which has been regarded to be of continuing relevance to the application of the provisions of that Act, albeit in the way discussed by the Court of Appeal in cases such as Dennis v Australian Broadcasting Corporation [2008] NSWCA 37 and those which have followed that decision. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    41 The circumstances which arose here were considerably different to those dealt with in Aon Risk Services. While this case, on one view, involved parties of considerable commercial sophistication, involving as it does claims and counter claims made between a number of businessmen involved in very substantial property transactions, on another view it concerned a serious falling out amongst close friends, who had not dealt with each other on a commercial basis, because of that friendship. Assaults and threats of violence to Mr Kakavas and members of his family were said to explain why an acknowledgment of a very large debt, which does not represent the true position, was given. 
     
      
    42 It was apparent that the plaintiffs had had a sufficient period time to put their case on a proper footing. While originally, in 2007, claims of unjust enrichment and restitution were advanced, they were abandoned and not claimed when Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos became parties to the proceedings. There was little explanation for the very late amendments pressed at the commencement of the hearing, a matter which the High Court emphasised required explanation, if an application such as this is to be granted. The explanation such as it was, was advanced in the context of the very unusual situation which came forward to be considered and the need to identify a basis upon which orders could be made in favour of the plaintiffs, given the position they were in and the difficulties presented by these unusual circumstances.  
     
      
    43 It seemed to me that there was much in the circumstances which weighed against the leave sought being granted. Undoubtedly, the defendants would have had to have been given an opportunity to amend their defences and to consider whether further evidence should be called, or whether further cross examination of Mr McCracken should be undertaken, had they submitted that was necessary in the circumstances, if the leave sought was to be granted.  
     
      
    44 No such case was pressed however. After explanation of the claims sought to be advanced and their basis, none of the defendants finally suggested that any real prejudice would flow to them from the leave sought being granted. No adjournment was thought necessary, no further cross examination of Mr McCracken was required and it was not thought that any other evidence would have to be called in any of the defendants’ cases.  
     
      
    45 Seeing that no real prejudice would flow from the grant of the leave and that there might be serious disadvantage flowing to the plaintiffs from its refusal, I concluded that justice required that the leave sought be granted. 
     
      
       
      Credit 
      
     46 In these proceedings, a great deal turned on the credit of those who gave evidence. The respective cases each had seemingly implausible elements. Resolving what was in dispute meant that either the evidence of Mr McCracken, or that of Mr Kakavas, largely had to be rejected. A similar contest lay between Mr McCracken on the one hand and Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos on the other.  
     
      
    47 Having carefully considered the evidence, particularly that given in cross examination, I have came to the conclusion that there was real difficulty in accepting that Mr Kakavas, Mr Kerwick or Mr Pilarinos were entirely truthful in the evidence which they each gave. There were also certain difficulties with Mr McCracken’s evidence, but to a much lesser degree. The conclusion which I have reached is that the evidence of the three defendants had to be approached with particular caution. I found aspects of their evidence entirely without credit. In most instances, where there was a contest between their evidence and that of Mr McCracken, I have reached the view that his evidence had to be preferred. I have also concluded that Mrs McCracken’s evidence must be preferred over that of Mr Kakavas. 
     
      
    48 Unraveling what truly transpired between these four men was difficult, requiring close consideration of affidavit and oral evidence, as well as various documents. For their part, the defendants relied on the changing claims which emerged from the various amended statements of claim advanced by the plaintiffs, Mr McCracken having repeatedly sworn affidavits attesting to the truth of the different claims advanced. While a relevant consideration, this was finally but of relatively little assistance in resolving the various issues lying between the parties, particularly those lying between Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas.  
     
      
    49 This was because consideration also had to be given to the affidavits sworn by Mr Kakavas supporting various defences he advanced, as well as his other affidavits and oral evidence which cast quite a different light on what had transpired between he and Mr McCracken, to what had been suggested in these defences.  
     
      
    50 In the original statement of claim, filed in August 2007, Mr McCracken claimed that $6,500,000 was paid to Mr Kakavas under the first agreement and that it was in October 2006, that he learned the Elite sale was not to proceed. He explained this was a typographical error and that this had occurred in November. He was closely cross examined as to other apparent errors in this and other claims. For his part, in his defence, filed in November 2007, Mr Kakavas denied that such an agreement had been made or that he received payments in accordance with the first agreement; he pleaded the second agreement, $250,000 of which had been repaid and claimed that he had only provided an acknowledgement of debt of $6,250,000 and subsequently made payments totaling $1 million through Mr Kerwick, because of Mr McCracken's threats. No reference was made in the defence to any agreement in relation to the sale of Mr Kerwick’s property to Mr McCracken, under which it was later claimed by Mr Kerwick and Mr Kakavas, that $2 million had been paid to Mr Kerwick by Mr McCracken.  
     
      
    51 So far as Mr Kakavas was concerned, the claimed agreement between Mr McCracken and Mr Kerwick only emerged in an affidavit which was sworn in May 2009, after the statement of claim had been amended to allege the existence of the third agreement and Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos had been joined as defendants and they had filed their defences. 
     
      
    52 Before those defences were filed, the first agreement was admitted in Mr Kakavas’ amended defence, filed in July 2008. There he claimed that he and Mr McCracken had recorded this agreement in writing in September 2006; that it was a term of the agreement that $4 million would be paid prior to the end of September 2006 and that it would not be refundable, in the event that Mr McCracken failed to complete the purchase. It was then also admitted that $4 million had been given to Mr Kakavas as part payment of the purchase price under the first agreement. It was also claimed that on 10 November, Mr McCracken had advised that he would not proceed with the purchase. While the third agreement was denied, there was no mention made of the alleged agreement in relation to the sale of Mr Kerwick’s property. 
     
      
    53 In Mr Kerwick’s original defence, filed in November 2008, the third agreement was denied and the alleged agreement in relation to the sale of his property, in respect of which it was claimed that Mr McCracken had paid him $2 million, was first pleaded. In Mr Pilarinos’ defence, also filed in August 2008, the third agreement was also denied, as was any obligation to refund any money to Mr Kerwick. 
     
      
    54 It was not until Mr Kakavas filed a defence to the third further amended statement of claim in September 2009, that he claimed that it was a term of the written contract which evidenced the first agreement, that the $4 million deposit paid in relation to the first agreement was not refundable at all, because of special conditions which he had drafted. Still, there was no reference made to the claimed sale of Mr Kerwick’s property to Mr McCracken, a transaction in which Mr Kakavas claimed he had been closely involved, having drafted special conditions for the written sale agreement which Mr Kerwick claimed he had signed and provided. For his part, Mr McCracken denied that such an agreement had ever been made, documented or provided to him. 
     
      
    55 The way in which the claims and defences emerged in the pleadings undoubtedly had to be considered in resolving the conflicts in the evidence of Mr McCracken, Mr Kakavas, Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos. So did the respective interests which the various parties had in the outcome of the proceedings.  
     
      
    56 The interest which Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas each had was obvious. Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos each had an interest not only in resisting the claims made against them, but also in Mr Kakavas succeeding. This was because, on their evidence, they had each loaned Mr Kakavas very substantial sums, which he was not in a position to repay. Mr Kerwick had loaned Mr Kakavas between $1 and $2 million and Mr Pilarinos, over $4 million. On his evidence, entities associated with Mr Pilarinos had also loaned Mr Kakavas further millions of dollars. These transactions were all undocumented. It was plainly in their interests to have Mr Kakavas succeed in his resistance of the case brought against him. 57 There were three other witnesses who should be mentioned at this point, whose evidence I found credible, for reasons which will become apparent. They were Mrs McCracken, Mr McKenzie–McHarg and Mr Chrysaffis. Mrs McCracken also had an obvious interest in the outcome of these proceedings. So did Mr McKenzie–McHarg.  
     
      
    58 Mr McKenzie–McHarg was a friend of Mr Kakavas, who had worked with him at Colliers International in Melbourne, where Mr McKenzie–McHarg was the chief executive officer when Mr Kakavas worked there as a salesman in the 1980s.  
     
      
    59 He had loaned Mr Kakavas $500,000, which Mr Kakavas gave to Mr Kerwick in November 2006, to pay to Mrs McCracken, after Mr McCracken had assaulted him, money which Mr Kakavas could not repay. Mr McKenzie-McHarg loaned Mr Kakavas the money, because of his account of the assault. There was no suggestion that Mr McKenzie–McHarg had anything to do with Mr Kakavas and Mr McCracken’s dealings with each other, or that Mr Kakavas or Mr Kerwick owed Mrs McCracken any money.  
     
      
    60 Mr Chrysaffis was a friend of both Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas, who had known Mr Kakavas since they had met in Melbourne in 1984. Only Mr Chrysaffis had not loaned Mr Kakavas any money, appeared to have no ongoing business dealings with Mr Kakavas and had no other obvious pecuniary interest in the outcome of the proceedings. He had witnessed the assault on 10 November and was closely involved in the creation of the acknowledgment which Mr Kakavas signed on 12 November. I found his evidence, that he knew Mr McCracken to be an honest man, of particular relevance in unraveling the conflicting stories which emerged from Mr McCracken, Mr Kerwick, Mr Pilarinos and Mr Kakavas. 
     
      
    61 The last witnesses who should be mentioned were Ms Dixon, the solicitor who acted for Mr Kakavas in relation to the first agreement and Ms Carter, a real estate agent to whom both Mr Kakavas and Mr McCracken were known. Neither had any personal interest in the proceedings and their evidence was also of assistance in resolving certain conflicts in the evidence of other witnesses. 
     
      
       
      What happened on 10 November to bring the relationship between Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas to an end? 
       
      
    62 A myriad of factual issues lay between the parties. Resolving what happened on 10 November 2006, which resulted in the breakdown of a friendship of the closest kind between Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas and their business dealings with each other, throws much light on other matters which are in issue. What occurred that day also had ongoing ramifications for the friendship which had existed between Mr McCracken, Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos. To resolve that question, some matters of background must be considered. 
     
      
    63 Both Mr Kakavas and Mr McCracken each described the other as their best friend. They first met in 2002 and quickly formed a bond of friendship out of their business relationship. Their families socialized and holidayed together. Between 2004 and 2006, Mr and Mrs McCracken accompanied Mr Kakavas and his fiancée on various trips to Las Vegas, paid for by a casino where Mr Kakavas was a large gambler. Mr McCracken was due to be a groomsman at Mr Kakavas' wedding on 10 November 2006.  
     
      
    64 Mr McCracken, a former professional footballer, was then pursing a living as a property developer, an occupation which he had commenced in 1989. He conducted a business buying, improving and selling commercial and residential properties through various companies, including the corporate plaintiffs. Mrs McCracken was also involved in that business. On Mr McCracken’s evidence, in 2006 he had substantial property holdings throughout Queensland. What they were was not explored in the evidence. 
     
      
    65 When Mr McCracken met Mr Kakavas, he understood Mr Kakavas to be working as a real estate consultant, selling residential and commercial properties in the Gold Coast area. Mr McCracken was then developing three residential apartments at Albatross Avenue, Mermaid Beach and Mr Kakavas sought the opportunity to list and sell these properties. Mr Kakavas’ work was successful, with the properties being sold for $10 million. He later gave Mr McCracken other advice, for which he was paid. It was common ground that over time Mr Kakavas and Mr McCracken came to make a number of property deals with each other, on the basis of handshake agreements, not recorded in writing. 
     
      
    66 On Mr McCracken’s evidence, in 2004, he and his wife purchased a house from Mr Kakavas at 89A Albatross Avenue, where they proposed to live, selling their Townsville home, for which Mr Kakavas found a purchaser. These agreements were not documented. A similar arrangement was made in 2003 in relation to the purchase and sale of a property at Hedges Avenue. The point was reached where the transactions in which Mr Kakavas and Mr McCracken were involved with each other, were rarely documented and they loaned each other money, amounting to millions of dollars, on the basis of a handshake. 
     
      
    67 For his part, Mr Kakavas’ evidence was that certain of the details of the transactions about which Mr McCracken gave evidence were inaccurate. For example, it was Mrs McCracken who was the purchaser of the Albatross Avenue property and he was not its owner, but had been paid commission on the sale, because of his introduction of the purchaser to the buyer. The Hedges Avenue property had involved a put and call option which Mrs McCracken had entered. That property was later sold to another purchaser introduced by Mr Kakavas, after the option was assigned.  
     
      
    68 Little turns on the details of these transactions. It was not in dispute that a personal and business relationship of the closest kind existed and that Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas helped each other out on numerous occasions. On Mr Kakavas’ evidence, the first time that he loaned Mr McCracken money was in 2003, when he loaned him $1 million under an oral agreement. The money was later repaid, Mr McCracken not being asked to pay any interest on the loan. Subsequently they made substantial short term loans to each other, always by undocumented oral agreements. Such loans were always repaid. 
     
      
    69 By 2005, Mr McCracken had become aware that Mr Kakavas gambled a lot and that his gambling had become more frequent and involved larger amounts of money. Mr Kakavas had told him that he had won $11 million on one occasion and he was aware that on others, Mr Kakavas had lost over $1 million on a night. Mr McCracken accompanied Mr Kakavas when he gambled in certain high roller rooms, where Mr Kakavas made numerous bets, for very large sums. In August 2006, while they were together in Las Vegas, Mr McCracken counseled Mr Kakavas that he had to stop gambling, because it would get him into trouble. While the details of the conversation were not agreed, Mr Kakavas agreed that there was such a conversation.  
     
      
    70 For his part, Mr Kakavas described himself as a pathological gambler, who had lost over $30 million gambling and whose addiction had ruined his life. In 1994, he had been convicted of an offence of obtaining property by deception, and had been sentenced to four months in prison, with a one year, eight month sentence suspended. When he gave his evidence, he was being sued in respect of credit of $1 million extended to him by a casino in the Bahamas, during his honeymoon in November 2006. There were other proceedings on foot, brought against him by another casino, in relation to another line of credit of $1 million. He owed very significant sums of money to various people from whom he had borrowed money for gambling. Mr Kakavas was himself then pursuing a claim in excess of $20 million against Crown Casino in the Victorian Supreme Court. 
     
      
    71 Mr McCracken made the first agreement with Elite in June 2006, without any documentation as to what had been agreed. He understood from Mr Kakavas that the $4 million deposit was to be used to refurbish the property. He agreed to a settlement in January 2007, when the mortgage on the property fell due for repayment.  
     
      
    72 On Mr Kakavas’ evidence, he agreed to sell Elite’s property for $14 million, even though it was worth $15 million, because of his friendship with Mr McCracken. He required a substantial deposit to be paid before settlement. There is no question that the $4 million was paid in instalments, as had been agreed. It was common ground that Mr McCracken was anxious to have a written contract put in place and that steps were later taken by Mr Kakavas to have one drawn up. There were issues as to when that occurred, what the document provided and what happened to the document, which Mr Kakavas claims he signed and provided to Mr McCracken, who also signed it. This Mr McCracken denies. 
     
      
    73 The second agreement, involving a loan of $500,000 was then made later in 2006 and the third, involving the $2 million paid to Mr Kerwick, was on Mr McCracken's case, made in early October. 
     
      
    74 Mr McCracken’s evidence was that Mr Pilarinos was another friend, who he had met through Mr Kakavas in 2002. The proposal which led to the third agreement came from Mr Kakavas. Mr Kakavas raised it with him in a conversation at which Mr Pilarinos was present. Mr Kakavas and Mr Pilarinos deny this. At the time, because of Mr McCracken’s concern about Mr Kakavas’ gambling, he also had a private conversation with him, seeking an assurance from Mr Kakavas that the $2 million he was to advance to Mr Kerwick would not be used to fund Mr Kakavas’ gambling. Mr Kakavas assured Mr McCracken that it would not and that he would make sure that it came straight back, if the deal fell through. Mr Kakavas also denied this. 
     
      
    75 On Mr McCracken’s case it was he who then spoke to Mr Kerwick, to tell him what had been proposed and that Mr Kerwick agreed. Mr Kerwick denies this. Mr Kerwick was also a friend of Mr McCracken’s, but not as close a one as Mr Kakavas. They were also neighbours.  
     
      
    76 There was also a disagreement as to whether the first agreement was brought to an end by Mr McCracken on 10 November, or by Mr Kakavas, when he put the property on the market on 11 November, which Mr McCracken learned of later. It was Mr McCracken’s evidence that this was Mr Kakavas’ decision, made after the assault and that it was a decision which he accepted. Mr Kakavas denies this. He claims that it was Mr McCracken who told him on 10 November that he did not want to proceed with the deal. 
     
      
    77 On Mr Kakavas’ evidence the reason for Mr McCracken’s decision was that he had come to the belief that he had agreed to pay too much for the Elite property. On 22 September, he had attended an auction of a National Australia Bank building with Mr McCracken. This was a property comparable to that which Elite had agreed to sell to Mr McCracken, although the Elite property was more substantial and generated greater rental income than the NAB property. The NAB property was passed in for $11.2 million. On 29 September, there was a newspaper report that the property had been sold for $12 million. Mr McCracken spoke to Mr Kakavas about the $14 million he had agreed to pay for the Elite property. Mr Kakavas told him the price was right, because his property was a 20% better one. On 10 November, Mr McCracken spoke to Mr Kakavas by phone and told him that he did not want to proceed with the purchase and wanted the deposit he had paid back, although he was happy to wait until Mr Kakavas had sold the property. Mr McCracken denies these events. 
     
      
    78 Mr Kakavas’ evidence was that on 10 November they had also discussed another purchase. In April 2006, Mr McCracken had told Mr Kakavas that he needed to sell his family home, but Mr Kakavas counseled him to move in and freshen the place up first. Mrs McCracken had the house under a put and call option, which was not due to settle until later in the year. In October 2006, he introduced Mr McCracken to a property at Mermaid Beach which Mr Kerwick had bought. That property required renovating and he believed Mr McCracken could get it for between $5 - $6 million. Mr Kakavas then told Mr Kerwick of Mr McCracken’s interest and Mr Kerwick fixed a price of $5.5 million. 
     
      
    79 It was Mr Kakavas and Mr Kerwick’s evidence that they then met with Mr McCracken at the house and a price of $6 million was agreed, with a delayed settlement and a $2 million deposit, to be released to Mr Kerwick. Mr Kakavas filled out a blank contract for sale of land provided to him by Mr Kerwick, who executed the contract and Mr Kakavas witnessed his signature. Mr Kerwick’s evidence was that he then dropped the contract in Mr McCracken's letterbox. They kept no copy. Mr McCracken denied any such discussions or agreement, or that he had ever received such a contract. 
     
      
    80 Mr Kakavas’ evidence was that on 10 November, he also discussed this transaction with Mr McCracken on the telephone, as well as the Elite sale, which Mr McCracken did not want to proceed with. Mr McCracken, who had earlier paid Mr Kerwick a $2 million deposit, said that he did not want to proceed with this purchase either and wanted his money back and that Mr Kakavas, who had got him into the deal, had to get him out. Mr Kakavas concluded the conversation by saying that he did not want to discuss ‘that stuff’ that day. Mr McCracken denied such a discussion.  
     
      
    81 On Mr McCracken's evidence, it was in early November that Mr Kakavas informed him that the third agreement, under which Mr Pilarinos was to purchase his house had fallen through. Mr McCracken asked for the return of the $2 million he had paid Mr Kerwick. While Mr Kakavas promised to see to its return, it was not repaid and so Mr McCracken followed the money up with him. Mr Kakavas promised that it would be in Mr McCracken’s account by 10 November, Mr Kakavas’ wedding day. 
     
      
    82 When the money had not arrived in his bank account that day, Mr McCracken spoke to Mr Kakavas, who promised to follow the matter up with Mr Pilarinos. Mr McCracken did not hear back from Mr Kakavas. Instead, at about 9.30 am, he had a phone call from his wife, who told him that she had seen Mr Kakavas in the street. He had stopped her and told her that he had taken the $2 million and sent it to a casino in Las Vegas, to pay off gambling debts which he owed. Mr Kakavas had told her that he could not tell Mr McCracken this himself. Mrs McCracken's evidence corroborated Mr McCracken’s account of their conversation. Mr Kakavas denied having such a conversation with Mrs McCracken.  
     
      
    83 On Mr Kakavas’ evidence, what he told Mrs McCracken on the morning of 10 November, when they met in the street shortly after he spoke to Mr McCracken, was that Mr McCracken had told him that morning that he did not want to proceed with the Elite purchase; that he had told Mr McCracken that he did not want to discuss it that day and that in any event, he could not give the money back, because he didn’t have it.  
     
      
    84 Mrs McCracken rang to tell Mr McCracken what Mr Kakavas had told her and that she would come home to talk to him. When Mrs McCracken returned home at about midday, she explained to Mr McCracken how she came to be stopped in the street by Mr Kakavas and what he had said to her. On his evidence, Mr McCracken formed the view that Mr Kakavas had stolen the $2 million, having promised him that it wouldn’t go to the casino. He was enraged and felt betrayed. This was what caused him to go to see Mr Kakavas at his home, to confront him. This was what led to the assault.  
     
      
    85 On Mr Kakavas’ evidence, Mr McCracken telephoned him at about midday, told him that he had a gun and threatened to come and kill him. Mr McCracken denies this, but does not deny that he assaulted Mr Kakavas after he arrived at the house. It was common ground that Mr McCracken had no gun and did not threaten Mr Kakavas with a gun at his home. 
     
      
    86 Unraveling what in truth happened between Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas, particularly on 10 November is difficult. Much is disputed. What there is no doubt about at all, is that the dealings between Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas on 10 November were out of the ordinary. That was the direct result of what Mr Kakavas told Mrs McCracken that morning. It was what Mrs McCracken understood from Mr Kakavas and what she then conveyed to Mr McCracken, which led to Mr McCracken’s assault of Mr Kakavas and the shattering of their relationship.  
     
      
       
      What did Mr Kakavas tell Mrs McCracken on 10 November 2006? 
       
      
    87 Resolving this issue assists in resolving the dispute as to what Mr Kakavas and Mr McCracken discussed by telephone earlier that morning. It is that discussion on which depends the question of who it was that brought the first agreement to an end. 
     
      
    88 The two accounts of the conversation between the two men were: 
     
      
       
      Mr McCracken’s version 
       
        
        Mr McCracken:  
        ""Look, the money hasn't hit my account yet. That money is supposed to be there. You said it will be in there by Friday at the latest."" 
        
       
       
        
        Kakavas:  
        ""I'll contact Jerry and see what's happened."" 
        
       
       
       
      Mr Kakavas’ version 
       
        
        McCracken:  
        ""Harry, I paid too much for 16 Queensland Avenue. It's not worth $14 million, it's only worth $12 million. I don't want it. I'm under too much pressure. I want the money I've already paid you back. But, because I'm pulling out of the contract, I'm happy to wait until you sell the property to get it. I don't want to proceed with The Esplanade property either. I want the $2 million I paid to Kerwick back straight away. You got me into the deal you get me out of the deal. 
        
       
       
        
        Kakavas:  
        ""Mate, I don't want to be talking about this stuff today. I'll see you later."" 
         
        
       
      
    89 Mr Kakavas’ evidence was, essentially, that when he spoke to Mrs McCracken, when he then encountered her by chance in the street, as she drove by him, he said no more to her than he had earlier told Mr McCracken. That evidence was not credible. It is difficult to believe that it was only because Mr Kakavas repeated what Mr McCracken had earlier told him to Mrs McCracken, that Mr McCracken became so enraged, as to assault Mr Kakavas hours before he was due to be a groomsman at his wedding, after Mrs McCracken recounted that conversation to him. It is much more likely that Mr Kakavas told Mrs McCracken something rather different, given Mr McCracken’s enraged reaction to what she told him. 
     
      
    90 For a number of reasons, I have concluded that Mrs McCracken’s evidence as to what Mr Kakavas told her must be preferred over his evidence. Mrs McCracken's account of the conversation in her affidavit was: 
     
      
       
        
         Kakavas:  
        ""I'm not sure if you know, but Jarrod had loaned two million dollars to Bill, that was then loaned to Jerry. It was to be used for Jerry to buy a property from Jarrod. Anyway, Jerry's finance fell through and the deal couldn't go ahead. Jerry was supposed to transfer the money back to Bill who would then transfer it to Jarrod."" 
         
         
        Michelle:  
        ""Yes, I know. Jarrod told me that the money was supposed to be coming back today."" 
         
         
        Kakavas:  
        ""Well, a problem came up. I owe a lot of money to some casinos in Law(sic) Vegas and they are chasing me for payment. I don't have any money for payment and I'm afraid it may get serious. I told Jerry to transfer the two million dollars to my account and I would give it to Jarrod. When Jerry transferred the money to me I paid it to the casinos."" 
         
         
        Michelle:  
        ""What? Jarrod's going to hit the roof."" 
         
         
        Kakavas:  
        ""I need you to tell him for me. Tell him I wanted to tell him myself but I just couldn't."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    91 Mr Kakavas’ affidavit evidence as to their conversation was:  
     
      
       
        
         
        Kakavas:  
        ""Jarrod called me this morning and said he did not want to proceed with Queensland Avenue and wants his money back. I told him today wasn't the day to discuss it."" 
         
         
        Michelle:  
        ""I don't know the precise arrangement you two had, but I'm sure you'll sort it out."" 
         
         
        Kakavas: ""I can't give him the money back anyway, because I don't have it."" 
         
        
       
       
        
       
      
    92 Mrs McCracken’s account was expanded in her oral evidence, when she was asked to comment on Mr Kakavas’ version of their conversation. She said that after an emotional discussion in her car about whether he could proceed with his wedding later that day, Mr Kakavas said to her: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Mich, I've got something else I need to tell you."" And he said, ""You know the money that Jerry's meant to pay back to Jarrod?"" He said, ""I've asked Jerry to give it to me."" And he said Alex Paranti came over from Vegas--  
         
        
       
      
    93 The evidence went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""And Harry said that Alex Paranti had come over from Las Vegas and he had had a talk to Harry. And he said if some money wasn't paid to the Las Vegas casinos things would get a bit nasty. So he got the money from Jerry and instead of it coming back to Jarrod he talked Jerry into giving him the money. And then he give it to Alex Paranti to give to the Las Vegas casino. And then he said sorry, I'm just a little bit nervous, yeah.  
         
         
        He then got the sorry, I've just like lost everything. I'm just really nervous because Harry's looking at me and you looked at me in the eye, Harry, and you made me look at you and you said that you would never hurt me and my family and you promised to get that $2m back. And now you sit here in a court and deny it. And I don't know how you could do that to us and look me in the eye that day and say that.  
         
         
        And then Billy, (indicated), you, you knew that conversation happened. You came around the corner and picked Harry up in the car, in your car, in the black BMW. You pulled him up in the cross street of Patrel Avenue and picked him up that day.  
         
         
        When you had that conversation with me, there was another guy in the car and, Harry, you pointed to him and said ""See that guy in the car there with Billy?"" I didn't know who it was, it was a man with dark hair. And you said that you were going to talk to that guy to get Jarrod's money back, the $2m. So and then before you got out of the car you made me look you in the eye and said, ""Michelle, I'd never hurt you or your family."" So now we sit here and you make us have to go through this. And I just don't know how you can do it when Jarrod's been such a good friend to you."" 
        
       
       
      
    94 It was clarified that ‘Billy’ was Mr Kerwick. In cross examination, Mrs McCracken agreed that this account was more extensive than the account given in her affidavit evidence, but she insisted that it was true and denied that she had made it up, in order to assist her husband’s case. She also denied that the money she and Mr Kakavas had referred to in their discussion, was the $4 million deposit paid in relation to the Elite sale. 
     
      
    95 When Mr Kakavas gave his oral evidence, he denied being in Mrs McCracken’s car; said that she was the last person in the world that he would have discussed his impending marriage with; that if he had confided in anyone, it would have been Mr McCracken and otherwise denied this account of their conversation. There was no evidence from Mr Kerwick denying Mrs McCracken’s account of his presence that morning, when he was later called to give evidence.  
     
      
    96 I am unable to accept Mr Kakavas’ version of this conversation over that of Mrs McCracken. Mr Kakavas’ evidence about his relationship with Mrs McCracken sat uncomfortably with the terms of a note which he had handwritten while holidaying together in Las Vegas with both Mr and Mrs McCracken, earlier in the year. There he wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Dearest Jarrod, 
         
         
        I am deeply humbled by your genuine care, support, understanding and friendship. I am so proud to call you my great friend because that is the least you deserve. Both you and Michelle are beautiful people with big hearts and I know that your friendship is  
        unconditional 
        . I deeply respect the enormous trust you have always shown me and assure you that I will never do anything to lose that. Thank you for coming on this trip as you have provided me great moral support and the strength to believe that there are better days ahead. I will never forget the kind words spoken by you and Michelle - thank you so much."" 
         
         
        
       
      
    97 Mr Kakavas stopping Mrs McCracken in the street to discuss repayment of money which Mr McCracken was pursuing with him, money which he could not repay because he had lost it gambling, seems quite consistent with his own description of Mrs McCracken, his relationship with her, his gratitude to her and with his own account of his gambling habits. As Mr Kakavas said in his own evidence, Mrs McCracken’s account of their conversation sounded like him. By way of contrast, Mr Kakavas’ evidence about what occurred this day was contradictory and implausible in a number of respects. Mrs McCracken’s evidence was not.  
     
      
    98 Mr Kakavas’ version of his conversation with Mrs McCracken was inconsistent with his own account of his conversation with Mr McCracken earlier that morning. If that version were accepted, when Mr Kakavas stopped Mrs McCracken in the street, he understood that Mr McCracken was content to wait for the return of the $4 million deposit until the Elite property was later sold elsewhere. While Mr McCracken wanted the return of the $2 million he had given to Mr Kerwick, on Mr Kakavas’ account, Mr McCracken did not demur, when Mr Kakavas told him that he did not want to talk about ‘that stuff’, that day. Why then would Mr Kakavas discuss with Mrs McCracken the repayment of the $4 million Mr McCracken was prepared to wait for and make no mention of the $2 million paid to Mr Kerwick, which he had also raised?  
     
      
    99 Mr Kakavas was due to leave for his honeymoon to the Bahamas early the following week. On Mr Kakavas’ account, Mr McCracken had no difficulty waiting for his money, as Mr Kakavas had asked. That accorded with the evidence of the nature of the relationship between the two men to that point. If this was the case, there was no reason for Mr Kakavas to have stopped Mrs McCracken in the street, to speak to her about his earlier discussion with Mr McCracken, or to speak to her about the matter at all. What motivated him to do so? Having the conversation which he claimed he had with Mrs McCracken, on his evidence, would have been both unnecessary and contrary to his relationship with her. 
     
      
    100 On Mr McCracken’s account, he had earlier asked Mr Kakavas for the return of the $2 million, he understanding from early November, that the third agreement was not to proceed and that accordingly, the $2 million was to be returned to him. They had not discussed the $4 million paid in respect of the Elite property at all. As far as Mr McCracken was concerned, the Elite purchase was proceeding. It was when the promised $2 million had still had not arrived by 10 November, that he rang Mr Kakavas, who promised to follow it up with Mr Pilarinos.  
     
      
    101 That account provides a plausible reason for Mr Kakavas stopping Mrs McCracken to speak to her in the street. He was close friends with both Mr and Mrs McCracken and could not bring himself to tell Mr McCracken that he was unable to return the $2 million which had been given to Mr Kerwick, because he had spent it. That scenario also sat quite comfortably with the oral evidence which Mr Kakavas gave, as to his intentions in relation to the money here at issue between he and Mr McCracken, even if he succeeded in resisting the claims brought against him in these proceedings and with the evidence as to what occurred to the $2 million paid to Mr Kerwick, which I will deal with later.  
     
      
    102 Mrs McCracken’s description of Mr Kakavas’ behaviour was not only consistent with Mr Kakavas’ emotional language and demeanor in the witness box, it also explains Mr McCracken’s reaction to what his wife told him, a reaction seemingly entirely out of character, given the two men’s relationship to that point. From Mrs McCracken, Mr McCracken learned that instead of pursuing the return of the $2 million with Mr Pilarinos as he had promised, Mr Kakavas had himself in fact gambled that money away and was not in a position to repay it to Mr McCracken. 
     
      
    103 Mr Chrysaffis’ evidence also shed some light on what was occurring at the time. That Mr McCracken had some concern, and that there was some problem between the two men shortly before the wedding, was confirmed by Mr Chrysaffis. His evidence was that he was a close friend of both men; he was the other groomsman at the wedding; he had spent time with the two families in the week before the wedding and he was not aware of any problems between Mr Kakavas and Mr McCracken. Still, he had noticed that Mr McCracken was preoccupied and reserved. That demeanor is entirely consistent with a growing concern on Mr McCracken’s part, that Mr Kakavas had promised to ensure the return of the $2 million and that the money had not been forthcoming, despite his promises. Mr McCracken had himself borrowed the money and needed to repay it. 
     
      
    104 There was a question as to why it was that Mr McCracken did not go to Mr Kakavas’ house until around midday, when his wife had spoken to him at about 9.30 am, after she spoke to Mr Kakavas. Mr Kakavas’ case was that Mr McCracken had delayed in order to put ‘maximum pressure’ on him, to repay money which he did not owe Mr McCracken. On Mr Kakavas’ own evidence, that would have been entirely out of character for Mr McCracken, given their relationship and inconsistent with their discussion that morning. The only explanation Mr Kakavas gave for Mr McCracken seeking the return of $4 million from him was that Mr McCracken had changed his mind about the Elite purchase, because he came to believe that the price was too high, given the price for which the NAB building sold. The case advanced for Mr Pilarinos was that Mr McCracken had overextended himself, a matter to which I will return, but that Mr Kakavas then had such an understanding, was not apparent from his evidence. He claimed that Mr McCracken had just changed his mind about the purchase. He often changed his mind.  
     
      
    105 Mrs McCracken’s explanation for her delay in returning home to speak to her husband, as she told him she would when they spoke on the phone, was that she had a hairdressing appointment for the wedding and was on her way to collect Mr Chrysaffis’ partner, Sophie, when stopped in the street by Mr Kakavas. After she spoke to her husband, she said she would go home to speak to him, but first continued with her hairdressing appointment. She did not return home until shortly before Mr McCracken left to go to Mr Kakavas’ house. I am unable to reject Mrs McCracken’s explanation. I did not find her to be an untruthful witness and the explanation seems a plausible one, in the circumstances. 
     
      
    106 On 10 November, Mr McCracken was concerned about the return of the $2 million he had been pursuing with Mr Kakavas for some time. Waiting for several hours for his wife to return, ruminating over what she had earlier told him, namely, that the money could not be repaid because Mr Kakavas had lost it gambling, explains why Mr McCracken went to confront Mr Kakavas in a fit of anger, after Mrs McCracken returned at around midday. Then he learned the details of her conversation with Mr Kakavas. Mr and Mrs McCracken’s evidence as to what occurred that morning was credible, particularly when considered in the light of Mr Kakavas’ own description of the nature of his relationship with Mr McCracken to that point and Mr Chrysaffis’ evidence that Mr McCracken’s behavior was out of character, in the week before the wedding. Mr McCracken’s explanation as to how he then felt was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""You know, I am meant to be the best man. He wanted me to be best man at his wedding but because of my non Greek background I couldn't be, so I was a groomsman for his wedding and I was looking forward to it. To me it was the ultimate betrayal and friendship and it was totally out of character, something that I am not very proud of but it was at the time where that's just what happened."" 
        
       
       
      
    107 That evidence was emotionally given. So was much of Mr Kakavas’ evidence. It will be necessary to deal with that evidence later, but convenient to observe at this point, that the close relationship which existed between Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas was undoubtedly what drove their actions that day and in the days which have followed. They were not men of business simply dealing with each other at arms length in relation to ordinary commercial dealings. 
     
      
    108 It should be observed that a reading of this judgment, or the transcript, is likely to give but a small insight into the extraordinary emotion displayed at times by Mr Kakavas and to a lesser extent by Mr McCracken and Mrs McCracken, during their oral evidence. At some points, Mr Kakavas was moved to tears, at one point he apologised to Mr McCracken, at another he claimed to have protected him, at another he threatened him. It will be necessary to say something further about Mr Kakavas’ outburst. At this point, however, it is sufficient to observe that by his unrestrained oral evidence, Mr Kakavas revealed that he regretted that he had been unable to repay the money Mr McCracken was claiming, even though he was relying on defences available to him to resist those claims. He, nevertheless, felt a moral obligation to repay what Mr McCracken sought. That it seems to me reflected a consciousness on Mr Kakavas’ part that the evidence which he had given was not entirely truthful. 
     
      
    109 For these reasons, I have concluded that Mrs McCracken's evidence as to what Mr Kakavas told her on 10 November and what she subsequently told her husband must be accepted.  
     
      
       
      What did Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas discuss on the morning of 10 November? 
       
      
    110 It follows that Mr McCracken’s account of his conversation with Mr Kakavas at about 9 am on 10 November must also be preferred over Mr Kakavas’ account. I am satisfied that what Mr McCracken was asking of Mr Kakavas when they spoke that morning, is what Mrs McCracken described Mr Kakavas having told her about half an hour later, namely that Mr McCracken wanted the $2 million paid to Mr Kerwick repaid. They did not discuss the termination of the Elite sale. It was after Mr McCracken learned from his wife that Mr Kakavas had gambled and lost that $2 million and that Mr Kakavas was too embarrassed himself to tell his best friend what he had done and that he was not in a position to repay the money, that Mr McCracken went to confront his friend in a fit of anger, seeking repayment.  
     
      
    111 Support for that conclusion is also provided by the evidence as to what transpired when Mr McCracken went to Mr Kakavas’ home.  
     
      
    112 Mr Kakavas’ affidavit account was that when Mr McCracken confronted him at his home on 10 November, he was screaming ‘[y]ou fucking dog, Kakavas! Where is my money? I want my fucking money back!’. Mr McCracken and Mr Chrysaffis gave a similar account. On Mr Kakavas’ own evidence, from their earlier conversation that morning, Mr McCracken had asked for the return of the $2 million paid to Mr Kerwick, but was prepared to wait for the $4 million deposit, until the property was sold, but accepted that they would not discuss the matter further that day. On Mr Kakavas’ evidence nothing that had occurred in the meantime, could have given him to understand that Mr McCracken had changed his mind about waiting for the $4 million. Mr McCracken did not mention any particular money amount during the confrontation at the house. It follows that nothing which Mr McCracken had done, could have given Mr Kakavas to understand that he wanted both the $2 million and the $4 million repaid. No amount was mentioned, as Mr Chrysaffis’ evidence confirmed. 
     
      
    113 Also to be considered is Mr Kerwick’s evidence that it was on 12 November that Mr McCracken spoke to him about the return of the $2 million. He has also not spoken to Mr McCracken since that day. Mr Kerwick’s evidence as to their conversation was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""McCracken:  
        It's Jarrod here. I want that 2 million dollars back. 
         
         
        Kerwick:  
        We have a deal, now stick to it. 
         
         
        McCracken:  
        I want that money back or we're going to have a fucking problem. You won't be safe walking down the street and I can't guarantee Kakavas' father's safety if I see him walking down the street. 
         
         
        Kerwick:  
        You must be joking. That's out of order. 
         
         
        McCracken:  
        That's the way it is. 
         
         
        Kerwick:  
        If you don't fulfil your obligations to the contract, it will be void and you will lose the 2 million. 
         
         
        McCracken:  
        I don't give a fuck. I'm getting it back one way or another. I'm not proceeding and you can tell your fucking wog mate Kakavas he got me into this deal and he's going to pay one way or another. 
         
         
        Kerwick:  
        O.K. That's it. As far as I'm concerned the contract is cancelled. 
        "" 
        
       
       
      
    114 Mr McCracken denies such a conversation Mr Kerwick claims that he then spoke to Mr Kakavas and their conversation was: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Kerwick:  
        Harry, McCracken just rang me and he wants his $2 million back. He made some threats against us including your father. He was pretty wild. 
          
         
         
        Kakavas:  
        Thanks for letting me know. 
        "" 
        
       
       
      
    115 Mr Kakavas’ account of this conversation was to quite different effect: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Kerwick:  
        ""Harry, I have just had a call from McCracken. He wants the $2 million deposit back on Palm Beach. He also told me to tell you that he cannot guarantee your father's safety walking down the street and that you are going to pay for this. He said he borrowed the $2 million for my deposit from some people in Sydney who are very heavy."" 
         
         
        Kakavas: "" 
        He is completely mad. What have I got to do with the $2 million?"" 
         
         
        Kerwick:  
        ""I told him he was out of line."" 
        
       
       
      
    116 There are some obvious inconsistencies between these accounts. I am unable to accept Mr Kerwick’s evidence over that of Mr McCracken. Even Mr Kerwick and Mr Kakavas’ accounts do not coincide and contain some curious omissions. 
     
      
    117 While Mr Kerwick claims that he told Mr Kakavas that both they and Mr Kakavas' father had been threatened, by Mr McCracken, Mr Kakavas makes no mention of any threat to Mr Kerwick. That is consistent with there having been no such conversation or threat made. Mr McCracken’s understanding was that it was Mr Kakavas who had spent this money, after it was given to him by Mr Pilarinos. On Mr Kerwick’s account, Mr Kakavas did not claim to have had nothing to do with the $2 million, as was his account. Even that is consistent with Mr Kakavas having spent the money. 
     
      
    118 Tellingly, in neither Mr Kerwick nor Mr Kakavas’ account was anything said about Mr McCracken also demanding to be repaid $4 million in respect of the Elite sale. Given the nature of their relationship and the fact that by 12 November, Mr Kakavas had already put the Elite property on the market and had acknowledged owing Mr McCracken $6,250,000, that he did not mention to Mr Kerwick, that Mr McCracken was also pursuing him for the repayment of the $4 million deposit in respect of the Elite sale, also suggests that as Mr McCracken claims, he was not doing so at that time.  
     
      
    119 Nor was anything said about the $2 million Mr Kerwick and Mr Kakavas were discussing having been paid by Mr McCracken as a non-refundable deposit on the sale of Mr Kerwick’s house. Given Mr Kerwick and Mr Kakavas’ evidence as to the terms on which Mr Kakavas came to organise this sale between his two friends, that neither said anything to the other about the $2 million not being repayable to Mr McCracken, seems a most unlikely omission from their discussion, if those terms had in fact been agreed. Given Mr Kakavas’ command of the details of the various transactions in which he has been involved with Mr McCracken and what he claims was his emotional state at the time, that he would have had such a short and dispassionate discussion with Mr Kerwick about the threats which he claims Mr Kerwick recounted to him, also seems rather unlikely. I am entirely sceptical that there ever was such a conversation. 
     
      
    120 To my mind, if such a conversation did occur between Mr Kerwick and Mr Kakavas on 12 November over Mr McCracken seeking repayment of $2 million, that tends to support Mr McCracken’s evidence as to what led him to go and confront Mr Kakavas on 10 November and what he was then pursuing with Mr Kakavas, namely repayment of the $2 million he had given to Mr Kerwick under the third agreement, not the $4 million paid in respect of the Elite sale. That they made no mention of the basis on which they now claim that Mr Kerwick had no obligation to repay that amount, also tends to support Mr McCracken’s evidence that there was no such agreement and that the conversation simply did not take place. 
     
      
    121 For those reasons, I have concluded that on 10 November, Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas did not discuss the Elite sale, or its termination.  
     
      
       
      The first agreement 
       
       
      Who decided that the Elite sale would not proceed? 
       
      
    122 The consequence of these conclusions is that it must be accepted that it was Elite which brought this agreement to an end, after Mr Kakavas decided that the sale would not proceed. That decision was made by Mr Kakavas after the assault. He and Mr McCracken have never discussed that matter.  
     
      
    123 I accept Mr McCracken’s evidence that the Elite transaction was not discussed between he and Mr Kakavas on 10 November. It was common ground that they have not spoken since the assault. Mr Kakavas put the property on the market on 11 November without discussion with Mr McCracken. While it was common ground that Mr McCracken asked Mr Kakavas, through Mr Chrysaffis and Mr Pilarinos, to give him an acknowledgement of what he owed, I accept that Mr McCracken only learned of Mr Kakavas’ decision to put the property on the market when he received that acknowledgment. On Mr McCracken's evidence, his attitude when he heard of Mr Kakavas' decision was that Mr Kakavas was entitled to proceed with that sale. That was not only consistent with the basis of their dealings with each other, but as he explained, Mr McCracken did not understand that he had a binding contract with Elite, because the written agreement had not been executed. 
     
      
    124 On Mr McCracken’s evidence, to that point he had no reason to believe that the Elite sale would not proceed, despite the falling out. He was in a position to proceed and was not unhappy with the price. He did not learn that the two properties had been put onto the market, until he received the acknowledgment of debt on 12 November. He had nothing to do with the second property. He explained that he had asked for the acknowledgment on 11 November, because there was no document evidencing any of the transaction and he wanted something to protect his position, before Mr Kakavas left the country on his honeymoon. That was why he approached Mr Pilarinos and Mr Chrysaffis for help and why he later sought his solicitor's help, after he received the acknowledgement and learned that the Elite sale was not proceeding. 
     
      
    125 This conclusion is also consistent with Mr Kakavas’ evidence, that after the assault he resolved to have nothing more to do with Mr McCracken. Such a resolution was entirely consistent with a decision on his part, that Elite would not proceed with the sale and with his view that he was selling the property to Mr McCracken at a very substantial discount of $1 million, given their friendship. On 11 November, Mr Kakavas put both the Elite property and another property which Elite also owned, onto the market, as he said in the acknowledgment which he handwrote that day. Those steps were also consistent with his financial situation, the need to find another purchaser for the Elite property, before the mortgage fell due in January and his impending departure on his honeymoon.  
     
      
    126 The only cogent evidence which might have supported Mr Kakavas’ version of events was that given by Mrs Carter. Mr Kakavas’ explanation for Mr McCracken’s decision not to proceed with the purchase was that he was always changing his mind and that he came to the conclusion that he had agreed to pay too much for the Elite property, because a comparable, although lower valued property, the NAB building, had sold in November for some $12 million, after being passed in at auction. In Mr Kakavas’ opinion, the price was not too high, but a concern on Mr McCracken's part over what he agreed to pay, grew after he learned of the price obtained for the NAB building, he and Mr McCracken having attended the auction at which that property had been passed in.  
     
      
    127 Mr McCracken denied attending this auction, or having such a concern, but Mrs Carter’s evidence that she saw him and Mr Kakavas at the auction, may not be rejected. The auction was conducted on the footpath, outside the building, near her office. She went out to watch the auction, where she saw Mr Kakavas and Mr McCracken, who she knew because she had acted for him in the past. She spoke briefly to them. Mrs Carter was not certain whether they stayed for the whole of the auction, but that she saw Mr McCracken there, may not be doubted. 
     
      
    128 Mr McCracken agreed that he and Mr Kakavas were together that day, on their way to lunch at a nearby café, the Sonata. He agreed that he was interested in the price obtained for the NAB building and believed that it was Mr Kakavas who later told him of the price. His evidence that they drove past the auction, but did not stop may not be accepted in the face of Mrs Carter’s evidence. His recollection was plainly mistaken.  
     
      
    129 Nevertheless, I am unable to accept that this fairly leads to the conclusion that it was Mr McCracken who decided not to proceed with the Elite purchase, because he had become dissatisfied with the price agreed, or that this was what he told Mr Kakavas on 10 November, given the other evidence, which I have dealt with. 
     
      
    130 It was Mr McCracken's case that it was some days after 14 November, when Mrs McCracken received a payment of $500,000 from Mr Kerwick, that he learned from Mr Pilarinos that Mr Kakavas could not proceed with the Elite sale because he needed to sell the property for $15,325,000, in order to pay out the mortgage falling due for repayment in January. Mr Pilarinos denied this, but that account seems entirely consistent with it being Mr Kakavas who decided that the Elite sale would not proceed, having in mind his evidence as to the problems which his gambling caused and Mr Pilarinos’ evidence, that since November 2006, he has assisted Mr Kakavas financially, including in relation even to meeting his legal and living expenses and that even before this discussion Mr Pilarinos and entities associated with him had loaned Mr Kakavas very substantial sums, which he believed were used for gambling – well over $4 million. It was undoubtedly in Mr Kakavas’ interests at this point to sell the Elite property for the value which he believed it had at the time, rather than at a substantial discount to Mr McCracken. 
     
      
    131 Mr Pilarinos certainly tried to help broker a resolution between Mr Kakavas and Mr McCracken after the assault. By the time he gave his oral evidence, Mr Pilarinos’ recollection of what had occurred appeared to have deteriorated significantly, since swearing his affidavit. While Mr Pilarinos apparently had a clear memory of his discussions with Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas at the time he swore his affidavit, when he was cross examined, he no longer had such a recollection. I found a great deal of his evidence unconvincing and implausible, with the result that I have concluded that Mr McCracken’s evidence has to be preferred over that of Mr Pilarinos, in the event of conflict.  
     
      
    132 On Mr Pilarinos' evidence on 11 November Mr McCracken told him that he did not want to proceed with the Elite purchase, because he had agreed to pay too much for the property and he wanted his deposit money back. He told Mr McCracken that it was a matter he had to sort out with Mr Kakavas, but that he didn’t think Mr Kakavas had any money at present. It was common ground that Mr McCracken asked Mr Pilarinos to pass on his request that Mr Kakavas sign an acknowledgement of what he owed, but he denied asking that the Elite property be put on the market, a denial which I accept. An understanding on Mr Pilarinos' part that Mr Kakavas had no funds was certainly consistent with Mr Pilarinos having recently provided over $4 million for Mr Kakavas to gamble with, at a time when on Mr Kakavas’ evidence, he was in serious difficulties, following his gambling losses in Las Vegas in August.  
     
      
    133 In cross examination, Mr Pilarinos said at one stage that the property he was discussing with Mr McCracken on 11 November was the two properties referred to in Mr Kakavas’ acknowledgement. Later, when pressed, he agreed that was not what he had meant, they had discussed only the Elite property. The distinct impression which Mr Pilarinos gave was that aspects of his evidenced had been tailored to assist Mr Kakavas' case. The Elite property was certainly put on the market by Mr Kakavas on 11 November, as he wrote in the acknowledgement, together with a second property. That was not a property in which Mr McCracken had any interest. On the evidence, it being put on the market was not a matter which could have been known to Mr McCracken before he received the acknowledgment Mr Kakavas wrote on 12 November. That it was Mr Kakavas who decided to put both properties on the market for reasons of his own, may not be doubted, despite Mr Pilarinos' evidence.  
     
      
    134 Mr McCracken took the acknowledgment document to his solicitors on 13 November, to seek advice in relation to protecting his position. They recommended that a mortgage be documented. One was prepared, but Mr Kakavas refused to sign it. 
     
      
    135 The Elite property did not sell and it was taken off the market in March 2007. Mr Chrysaffis then told Mr McCracken that the only way he was going to get his money was if Mr Kakavas’ case against the Crown Casino succeeded. In cross examination, Mr Kakavas repeatedly confirmed his intention to pay Mr McCracken at least something, in respect of the first agreement, even if these proceedings went his way. That was undoubtedly what Mr Kakavas also intended to do with the proceeds of the sale of the Elite property when he put it on the market. 
     
      
    136 That Mr Kakavas felt so strongly that he ought to repay Mr McCracken, notwithstanding his defence of these proceedings, also tended to confirm that Mr McCracken was being truthful in his evidence, that it was Mr Kakavas, not he, who decided not to proceed with the Elite sale.  
     
      
       
      Did the written sale agreement contain the special conditions Mr Kakavas claimed to have drafted? 
       
      
    137 There were many other factual issues lying between the parties. It is convenient next to consider whether or not terms were agreed that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1) Both the buyer and seller agree that the sum of $2,000,000 has already been paid and released to the seller and is non-refundable. 
         
         
        2) Both the buyer and seller agree that a further deposit of $2,000,000 will be made by no later than Sept 30 
        th 
         2006 and will be immediately released to the seller and will be non-refundable.  
         
        
       
      
    138 I have concluded that there was no such agreement. Mr Kakavas claimed that in preparing the Elite contract, the solicitors were instructed to keep the name of the purchaser and other details such as the price blank, because of Mr McCracken's desire for confidentiality. Why that would be so, was not apparent from the evidence, but Mr McCracken's evidence was that the contract which he collected was in that form. 
     
      
    139 It was Mr Kakavas’ case that it was he who collected the contract which the solicitors had prepared and left out for Mr McCracken to collect; that he then handwrote the above terms as special conditions in that contract, together with other details including the price; that he then signed that contract, returned it to his solicitors and left it in the envelope for Mr McCracken to collect. Mr McCracken denies that such terms were agreed, or that the contract he collected had such handwritten provisions, or that the contract had been signed. I have concluded that Mr McCracken's evidence may not be rejected.  
     
      
    140 I am satisfied that while it was agreed that Mr McCracken would pay the $4 million deposit direct to Mr Kakavas, understanding that the money was to be used for refurbishment work underway, rather than to Elite or a stakeholder, the idea that Mr Kakavas, or Elite, were entitled to retain this deposit if the sale did not proceed, was never discussed or agreed as Mr Kakavas claimed.  
     
      
    141 Not even Mr Kakavas suggested in his evidence that there had been any discussion between he and Mr McCracken about such a term, when the oral agreement was made. That was understandable. Such an agreement would have been quite inconsistent with the basis on which Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas had dealt with each other up to that point. The idea that Mr Kakavas would ask Mr McCracken to release to him a deposit of $4 million, on the basis that Elite would not need to repay it, if the sale did not proceed, as the result of a decision made by Mr Kakavas, is simply not credible, given Mr Kakavas’ own account of his relationship with Mr McCracken. Such an arrangement would have put Mr Kakavas in a position where he could have exploited his friend in a way entirely contrary to their dealings with each other and quite different to how he described he had always treated and dealt with Mr McCracken and how he proposed to deal with him in future. I am unable to conclude that Mr Kakavas sought such an opportunity, or that it was agreed. That conclusion was supported by the way in which this aspect of Mr Kakavas’ defence emerged so belatedly in the pleadings, another matter which casts doubt on Mr Kakavas' version of events.  
     
      
    142 At the time the oral agreement was made, there had never been any difficulty in their dealings with each other. They had been in the habit of helping each other out, by loaning very substantial sums, undocumented, on occasion even without interest being required to be paid. Otherwise, they had been involved in a number of other undocumented transactions. That was not possible in the case of a sale of property, which required documentation in order that the transaction could be completed. So it was agreed that the contract for sale would be documented and it was. Even though Mr Kakavas claimed that he had signed the contract and given it to Mr McCracken, who also signed it, it was common ground that contracts were never exchanged. 
     
      
    143 No such contracts were in evidence. Mr Kakavas kept no copy of what he claimed he provided and Mr McCracken did not retain a copy of the contract which he collected. 
     
      
    144 It was not until Mr Kakavas swore his affidavit in 2009, that this version of his dealing with Mr McCracken emerged. There he annexed a copy of a reconstituted written contract, which contained the claimed term as a special condition. He claimed that Mr McCracken himself later signed the contract, but had concealed the document, in order to advance the plaintiffs’ case. Mr Kakavas’ evidence was that Mr McCracken told him on 21 September 2006, the day before they attended the auction of the NAB building, that he had also signed the contract and would keep it, ‘in case something happens to you’. Mr McCracken denied this. That would certainly have been an unlikely thing for him to do, or to say, had Mr McCracken had the concerns Mr Kakavas’ described him having in relation to obtaining a written contract, in order to protect his position. Again, Mr Kakavas’ evidence was most implausible and I am not able to accept it.  
     
      
    145 Mr Kakavas’ case was also that the special condition, which he drafted, referred to $2 million already having been paid as a deposit. The difficulty with that evidence was that it was common ground that by early September, when the contract was prepared and provided to Mr McCracken, $2.325 million had been paid to him. That the special condition Mr Kakavas claims he wrote, would have reflected an amount different to that already paid, is entirely unlikely. On his own account, Mr Kakavas had an excellent command of his dealings with Mr McCracken and paid close attention to details. It was Mr McCracken who did not.  
     
      
    146 It was Mr Kakavas who wanted a delayed settlement and the release of the $4 million deposit in the meantime. In those circumstances, no reason for requiring a term that the deposit would be non-refundable was apparent, other than Mr Kakavas’ claim that he was agreeing to give Mr McCracken a discounted price on the property, because of their friendship. When the sale to Mr McCracken did not proceed, Mr Kakavas had difficulty selling the property to other buyers. Another contract was later issued for $14.2 million, but the sale did not proceed. On Mr Kakavas’ evidence, it was eventually sold for $9 million, after a downturn in the market.  
     
      
    147 Mr Kakavas had an obvious motive for concocting this scenario, following Mr McCracken’s assault; the difficulties which flowed from his pathological gambling; the consequences which he perceived had followed from the acknowledgement of debt he had signed and the $1 million he had later paid to Mrs McCracken, which he now seeks to recover, apart from $250,000. It was very much in Mr Kakavas’ interests to recover what he had paid, given his very substantial indebtedness to others, including Mr McKenzie–McHarg, Mr Kerwick, Mr Pilarinos and entities associated with him. 
     
      
    148 By way of contrast, the evidence as to the approach which Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas customarily adopted to their dealings with each other makes the agreement to payment of a $4 million deposit, before the contract was formalised, entirely understandable. That was how Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas commonly dealt with each other. The settlement was not due until the end of January 2007. There was nothing unusual in Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas proceeding in the interim in accordance with an oral agreement, in the absence of the written contract being executed, even when one was necessary. That was certainly the case here, given the requirements of the Property Law Act 1987 (Qld), Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas were aware of the need to reduce the oral agreement to writing; agreed that would occur; took steps to ensure that it happened and in the meantime, acted in accordance with the oral agreement. 
     
      
    149 For Mr Kakavas, it was claimed that three things supported his version of what had occurred. The first, that in his first affidavit Mr McCracken said that while he had not retained a copy of the contract, it had a price of $14 million. The contract Ms Dixon had prepared did not contain a price. It was submitted that the price was an amount which only Mr Kakavas could have written in the document Ms Dixon had produced. In cross examination, Mr McCracken said the price was blank and that by his affidavit, he was not intending to convey that the price was written in the contract, but that $14 million was what had been agreed.  
     
      
    150 Mr McCracken’s affidavit evidence that the contract he collected specified a price of $14 million, certainly supported Mr Kakavas’ evidence that he had filled in the price. In his oral evidence, Mr McCracken claimed that the price had not been written in. That Mr McCracken might have made a mistake in his recollection of what the contract provided, as he explained, when he did not have a copy at the time of swearing his affidavit, is certainly possible. It is also possible that he was lying, but that is a conclusion which I have not been able to reach. 
     
      
    151 The second matter was that when Mr McCracken went to see his solicitors on 13 November 2006, to seek their advice about the $4 million deposit he had paid, he did not show them the contract, even though he then had the original contract provided to him, in his possession. It was argued that Mr McCracken concealed that contract, because the special condition would not have assisted his case. In cross examination, Mr McCracken explained what had become of the contract: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Q. So what did you do with it? 
         
        A. It sat - I know exactly where it was. It sat in my office in my home and subsequently because of what had transpired with money being stolen from me, from Mr Kakavas, I had to sell my house quickly in order to get money back and I had commitments with my son through the sporting achievements that I had to - I was not at home at the time when we sold our house, when the packer - my house was getting packed by my wife and my mother-in-law at the time, so we put a lot of our stuff in storage and I dare say that when they packed up the house it was thrown away."" 
        
       
       
      
    152 This was submitted not to have been credible evidence, but there is no question that the family home was sold in December and that the family moved overseas. When that occurred is not clear. Mr McCracken also explained that he did not take the contract, which he then had, to his solicitor when seeking assistance in November, because it was a blank document, without a name, price or any other conditions, and he believed that it was not of assistance to him, in the circumstance in which he was then seeking advice. He accepted that Mr Kakavas was entitled to put the Elite property on the market. What he took with him was Mr Kakavas’ acknowledgement of debt. He denied that the contract contained the special conditions Mr Kakavas claimed; that both he and Mr Kakavas had signed it, or that he was concealing that document from his solicitors. He explained that at the time he was not contemplating taking legal action, but was seeking advice as to how he could protect his position, given that there was no written contract exchanged. The advice received was to have a mortgage documented, with Mr Kakavas as the borrower and Elite as guarantor. Such a document was prepared, but Mr Kakavas refused to sign it. 
     
      
    153 The third matter relied on was that in other property transactions, Mr McCracken and his wife had agreed to conditions such as those which Mr Kakavas here claimed were agreed. Given his relationship with Mr Kakavas, there was no reason to think that Mr McCracken would not have agreed to such terms, in this case. The natural thing would have been for Mr McCracken to sign the contract supplied by Mr Kakavas, once the lease information had been supplied, as Mr Kakavas claimed Mr McCracken told him that he had done. 
     
      
    154 The evidence showed that Mr McCracken and his wife had agreed, in some transactions in which they had been involved, to terms of the kind claimed by Mr Kakavas to have been agreed on this occasion, in relation to the deposit. Why they were agreed in those transactions was not explored. Presumably it was because they were conditions which other vendors required. In other transactions in which Mr McCracken and his wife had been involved, such terms had not been agreed. Here, there was no evidence of any discussion of such a term, before or after Mr Kakavas claims he drafted the term and provided it to Mr McCracken, when he collected the executed contract.  
     
      
    155 I am unable to accept the case advanced for Mr Kakavas. I accept that Mr McCracken showing his solicitors the contract, which he then had, when he sought advice in November 2006, would have been the obvious step for him to take.  
     
      
    156 Mr McCracken’s evidence as to his understanding of the blank contract he had been provided with and what had occurred to it, it seemed to me was credible, according with Mr Kakavas’ own account of Mr McCracken’s approach to and understanding of the details of transactions in which he was involved. By way of contrast, that Mr Kakavas would not have kept a copy of a contract for the sale of a $14 million property prepared by his solicitors and which he had signed, was not. 
     
      
    157 I am simply unable to accept Mr Kakavas’ evidence that the claimed special condition was ever agreed, documented or provided to Mr McCracken, whose denials of these matters I accept. 
     
      
       
      Was the written contract signed? 
       
      
    158 Mr Kakavas claims that he was never provided with a copy of the written agreement when signed by Mr McCracken. If, as Mr Kakavas claims, Mr McCracken signed the written agreement because he had been anxious since August 2006 that it be made, on Mr Kakavas’ case, because of Mr McCracken’s concerns about Mr Kakavas’ gambling losses, why did Mr McCracken not provide the agreement to his lawyers, when he received the signed contract from Mr Kakavas in early September so that the transaction could be finalised? Mr McCracken could then have proceeded to have the contracts exchanged, thereby obtaining the security Mr Kakavas claimed he was so anxious to achieve. On Mr Kakavas’ case, Mr McCracken was an experienced property developer; not across the details of transactions in which he was involved, but anxious to secure the very substantial deposit he had by then already advanced to Mr Kakavas.  
     
      
    159 It was common ground that Mr McCracken believed that the contract needed to include a tenancy schedule and information in relation to leases. On Mr Kakavas’ case that information was supplied, but still Mr McCracken did nothing to ensure that his legal position was protected.  
     
      
    160 Mr McCracken never provided the contract to his solicitors. He did ask Mr Kakavas for information about the leases over the property; he paid more of the agreed deposit, as well as loaning Mr Kakavas $500,000 under the second agreement, for a bet on the football. Mr Kakavas claimed that the information sought about the leases was provided. Had that been the case, there would have been no reason for Mr McCracken not to give the contract to his solicitors to arrange an exchange. To the contrary, had Mr McCracken had the concerns Mr Kakavas claimed he had, it would have been unlikely for him to delay, or to have loaned Mr Kakavas a substantial sum of money, to gamble with.  
     
      
    161 Providing the contract to his solicitors would have been the natural step, once Mr McCracken received the information about the leases, which he was seeking. While Mr McCracken claimed that he did not receive the contract prepared by Mr Kakavas’ solicitors until early October, after the $4 million had all been paid, it is apparent from Ms Dixon’s evidence and a file note in evidence, that she produced a contract in early September and left it out to be collected. It was entirely possible that Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas discussed the contract in early October, as was Mr McCracken's evidence, there was still been no exchange by that, but that he only collected the contract in October seems unlikely.  
     
      
    162 Mr Kakavas, however, claimed that he had himself collected the contract, added the handwritten special condition and a tenancy schedule, signed it, and returned it to the solicitor for Mr McCracken to collect, with instructions that information about the leases be provided to Mr McCracken. This scenario is difficult to believe and is not supported by other relevant evidence. If that is what occurred, why would Mr Kakavas not himself have given the contract to Mr McCracken? After all, they were very close friends, in very frequent contact with each other.  
     
      
    163 It was common ground that whenever Mr McCracken obtained the contract, he was not happy with it, because it did not contain information in relation to leases, which he thought was needed. Mr Kakavas’ evidence was that he promised to have the leases put together for Mr McCracken to collect. He then spoke to Ms Dixon, asked her to copy the leases and leave them out for Mr McCracken to collect, which he did. Mr McCracken also denied this. 
     
      
    164 Ms Dixon had no recollection of doing anything in relation to the leases, which under the relevant Queensland laws did not have to be annexed to the contract. In evidence was a letter of 2 October 2007 from Mr John Ramsden, a principal of the firm by which Ms Dixon was employed, to Mr Kakavas, confirming that the contract Ms Dixon had prepared in early September had been collected, as Mr Kakavas had instructed it would be and that subsequently, leases had been copied and also left out for collection. Mr Ramsden advised that copies of the leases had not been retained, only originals. A copy of the contract Ms Dixon had prepared was said to be annexed to the letter, but it was not in evidence. There was no suggestion that it contained the claimed special condition, or the tenancy schedule.  
     
      
    165 In her oral evidence Ms Dixon said that when she left the contract out to be collected, she was not aware that it was collected by Mr Kakavas as he claimed, returned and collected again by Mr McCracken, which would have been ‘a little unusual’. There was also no note on the file as to anything being done in relation to the leases. Ms Dixon had no recollection of the leases later being copied and collected. She did not provide the information contained in Mr Ramsay’s 2 October 2007 letter. There was no suggestion that Mr Ramsey himself had any personal knowledge as to these matters. He was not called. Later in December 2006, Ms Dixon produced another contract for the sale of the property to a different purchaser, at a price of $14.2 million. 
     
      
    166 Mr McCracken’s evidence that the contract he collected was not signed and did not include a tenancy schedule or the claimed special condition accorded with Ms Dixon’s account of what she had prepared, but not when it was collected, which was earlier in September. It was agreed that when he spoke to Mr Kakavas about the leases, Mr Kakavas told Mr McCracken to go direct to speak to his lawyers, about the changes which McCracken wanted. Mr McCracken claims that he did so in mid-October, when he spoke to a male solicitor whose name he could not remember, not Ms Dixon. He was promised an amended contract, but he never received one.  
     
      
    167 It seems unlikely, given Ms Dixon’s evidence, that Mr McCracken only received the contract in mid-October. Still, I am unable to accept Mr Kakavas’ evidence that he signed the contract in the terms which he claims and returned it to his solicitor, from whom Mr McCracken collected it, without his solicitor’s knowledge and without he or they keeping a copy. Nor is it credible that Mr McCracken then signed that contract, even though he had concerns with it, but did not engage his solicitors to pursue an exchange and did not provide Mr Kakavas with the copy he had signed. That Mr Kakavas and Mr McCracken had a very relaxed approach to their dealings with each other is not open to doubt. That there would have been such a departure from the usual course, once solicitors were engaged to document the sale, Mr Kakavas having signed the contract and provided all that Mr McCracken required, who also signed the contract, is not plausible and not supported by the other evidence to which I have referred.  
     
      
    168 In this respect I have also concluded that Mr Kakavas’ evidence may not be preferred over that of Mr McCracken. 
     
      
       
      Can any relief be granted on the breach of contract claim? 
       
      
    169 The plaintiffs’ case was if a contract had come into existence between Elite and Mr McCracken it was unenforceable, given the provisions of s 59 of the Property Law Act, which requires that contracts for the sale of land be in writing. Further, that s 11 of the Land Sales Act 1984 (Qld) had the effect that a provision for the payment of money by way of deposit, without the purchaser becoming entitled to receive a registrable instrument of transfer in exchange therefore, other than to a solicitor or real estate agent to be held in a trust account, is void. (See Emilien v Cabbala [1989] 1 Qd R 620). In later submissions it was accepted that this legislation did not in fact apply to the property, but that other provisions of the Property Law Act had similar effect. 
     
      
    170 It was further argued that Elite had no right to terminate the agreement, without notice of default. It followed that Mr Kakavas had no basis for claiming that the $4 million deposit was not refundable. There was no exchange and Elite never received any of the deposit money, which never went into a solicitor or agent’s trust account, Ramsden Fae being identified as the stakeholder in the written contract which they had prepared.  
     
      
    171 For his part, Mr Kakavas did not dispute that while the oral agreement on which the plaintiffs sued had been made in 2006 between Elite and Mr McCracken and that there had never been any exchange of written contracts. It was argued, however, that the oral agreement was of the first or second classes of contracts discussed in Masters v Cameron (1954) 91 CLR 353 at 360, the parties contemplating that the making of a written contract was merely a step in the performance of the legally binding agreement already made between them.  
     
      
    172 In Abadeen Group Pty Ltd v Bluestone Property Services Pty Ltd; Brown v Hodgkinson [2009] NSWCA 386, consideration has recently been given to the principles to be applied in determining whether parties intended to contract with each other. This depends on the facts of the case, considered objectively in the commercial context in question. At [116] it was observed: 
     
      
       
        
         
        116 The fact that the parties to an agreement expressly contemplate that “the matter of their negotiation shall be dealt with by a formal contract” does not necessarily mean that they have not entered into a binding contract:  
        Masters v Cameron 
        , at 360, per curiam. Indeed, two of the three classes of case identified in  
        Masters v Cameron 
         result in a binding agreement notwithstanding that the parties contemplate that a formal contract will be executed later. Whether or not there is a fourth class of case (cf  
        Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd v G R Securities Pty Ltd 
         at 628, per McLelland J;  
        G R Securities Pty Ltd v Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Pty Ltd 
        , at 634-635, per McHugh JA;  
        Tasman Capital Pty Ltd v Sinclair 
        , at [25]-[26], per Giles JA), the parties may intend to be bound immediately by the terms they have agreed, while expecting to make a further contract in substitution for the first, containing additional terms:  
        Sinclair, Scott & Co v Naughton 
         [1929] HCA 34; 43 CLR 310, at 317, per Knox CJ, Rich and Dixon JJ. As was said by Giles JA in  
        Tasman Capital Pty Ltd v Sinclair 
        , at [29]:  
         
         
          
           
           “Uncertainty and incompleteness in what has been agreed and the prospect of refinement and future agreement are material to whether the parties intended to make a concluded bargain, but once the intention be found the court will seek to uphold the bargain by resolving the uncertainty and fulfilling the incompleteness; although if that can not be done by accepted principles of construction and implication, the intention as found may fail”. 
           
          
         
        
       
      
    173 On the evidence of both Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas, until the property was put onto the market on 11 November, they each conducted themselves on the basis of an understanding that Elite and Mr McCracken had reached a binding agreement in respect of the sale of the property. Unlike the circumstances which arose for consideration in Abadeen Group Pty Ltd, they had made no note of the oral agreement, which Elite’s solicitors were instructed to document, but it was not suggested that there were any gaps in the agreement which had been reached, which required further negotiation. 
     
      
    174 It is apparent that when the property was put on the market, Elite repudiated the first agreement, a repudiation which Mr McCracken then accepted, as he was entitled to do. While the necessary steps were being pursued to have the written contract finalised, as I have earlier explained, they were not yet complete, when Elite acted to ensure that the sale would not proceed. That does not leave open the conclusion that the parties were not already bound by their agreement. On the evidence they intended to be bound by their oral agreement, formal documentation of the agreement being but a step in the performance of what had already been agreed and acted on. 
     
      
    175 While the written agreement was never exchanged, as the oral agreement contemplated, the $4 million deposit had already been paid by instalments direct to Mr Kakavas. Mr McCracken understood that the money was to be used for refurbishment work. Consistently with that understanding, the payments were reflected in Elite’s accounts and bank records. In accordance with the agreement they were payments received by Mr Kakavas, on Elite’s behalf, as the accounts reflected. That Mr Kakavas used the money to gamble with, cannot alter the contractual arrangement.  
     
      
    176 Mr McCracken’s argument that it followed that Elite could never have performed the contract, because it never received the deposit money may not be accepted. Nor can it be accepted that the contingent special condition in the written contract, of money being released to the seller, even if agreed, was also never satisfied.  
     
      
    177 For reasons which I have already explained, I have concluded that there was no agreement in the terms claimed by Mr Kakavas, that the $4 million deposit was not refundable. Mr McCracken did not fail to make any payment due under the contract, or to adhere to any other of the terms agreed. Mr Kakavas was Elite’s guiding mind. The decision that the sale would not proceed was Elite’s, not Mr McCracken’s. It follows that under the parties’ agreement the vendor, Elite, had no right to retain the deposit, when it terminated the agreement. 
     
      
    178 Section 59 of the Property Law Act precluded any action being brought on the contract for sale, unless it was reduced to writing. Given the terms of the oral agreement, once Elite had repudiated the oral agreement, Mr McCracken could have rejected the repudiation, sued upon that agreement, requiring Elite to execute a written agreement in the terms which had been agreed. (See Freedom v AHR Constructions (1987) 1 Qd R 59). As I have found, those terms did not include the special condition Mr Kakavas claimed. While the oral agreement was brought to an end by Elite before the written agreement was executed, in the circumstances there can be no question that Mr McCracken was entitled to recover the $4 million already paid in accordance with the oral agreement from Elite, he having accepted the repudiation of the agreement. In those circumstances it had no right to retain that deposit. 
     
      
    179 Those conclusions cannot, however, lead to any orders being made against Mr Kakavas. There was no claim that he was ever a party to the oral agreement and no evidence that it was contemplated that he would become a party to the written agreement. (See Wilson v Darling Island Stevedoring & Lighterage Company Limited [1956] HCA 8;(1956) 95 CLR 43.)  
     
      
       
      The acknowledgment of debt 
       
      
    180 Can the acknowledgement of debt which Mr Kakavas provided Mrs McCracken, nevertheless form the basis of the relief sought against Mr Kakavas? The answer must be no. I will deal separately with the question of the circumstances in which it was given, when dealing with the cross claim, where the circumstances in which it was produced, must be considered.  
     
      
    181 What must be considered at this point is that the plaintiffs did not sue upon the acknowledgement itself and did not suggest that they could. The plaintiffs' case was that the document was an admission, in accordance with s 84 of the Evidence Act 1995. If the document was an admission, what did it admit? There is no suggestion that Mr Kakavas was ever a party to the first agreement. The acknowledgement cannot alter the nature of, or the parties to, that agreement. That Mr Kakavas acknowledged a debt, which did not in fact exist, cannot create a contractual basis upon which Mr McCracken can now sue, nowthstanding the acknowledgement. 
     
      
    182 That Elite and Mr McCracken made an agreement that a substantial part of the purchase price would be paid before completion of the sale cannot give rise to any contractual entitlement to recover what was paid to Mr Kakavas, a third party, in accordance with the agreement, notwithstanding his acknowledgement.  
     
      
    183 The fact that there was no written contract entered into, as the oral agreement contemplated, can take the matter no further. Mr McCracken undoubtedly has an action against Elite in respect of the agreement, but not against Mr Kakavas. He certainly received the deposit it was agreed would be released to Elite, but not on his own account. That Mr Kakavas later acknowledged a debt which did not exist, cannot alter that position. 
     
      
    184 While it was accepted for Mr Kakavas that it might have been possible to advance a claim that there was an agreement reached between Mr Kakavas and Mr McCracken, that they would each take the steps necessary to have the corporate entities through whom they conducted their businesses, enter into a binding agreement in relation to the sale of the Elite property, that was not the case advanced by the plaintiffs.  
     
      
       
      Restitution 
       
      
    185 As I have explained, Elite had no contractual right under the first agreement to retain the deposit paid direct to Mr Kakavas, if the sale of the property did not proceed. It was accepted for Mr Kakavas that if there was no such right, then Mr McCracken, the other party to the contract, could recover the deposit as money had and received from Elite. There is no such claim. 
     
      
    186 Again, relief is sought only against Mr Kakavas. I cannot see that the plaintiffs are entitled to such relief, given that he was not a party to the agreement. His involvement in and responsibility for the payment of the $4 million directed to him is abundantly clear, given his control of Elite, the corporate vehicle through which he acted and which owned the property. His evidence was that he spent the money gambling. His acknowledgment of debt and his evidence shows that he accepts his moral obligations in relation to the repayment of this money to Mr McCracken. That he has a legal obligation to do so, is not apparent.  
     
      
    187 In Lumbers v W Cook Builders Pty Ltd [2008] HCA 27; (2008) 232 CLR 635 at [46] - [47] and [79] it was observed: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [46] So far as appears from the evidence, Builders had, and may still have, a viable claim against Sons. The claim was not defeated on the merits or otherwise in any relevant respect rendered worthless. Builders and Sons have their own separate creditors and members. The contractual arrangements that were made effected a certain allocation of risk; and there is no occasion to disturb or interfere with that allocation. On the contrary, there is every reason to respect it. There was no mistake or misunderstanding on the part of Builders. It was accepted on both sides in argument that in the ordinary case a building sub-contractor does not have a restitutio nary claim against a property owner, but must look for payment to the head contractor [53] . That was said to be subject to exceptions [54] , but the difficulty for Builders was to show that the case fell within any recognised exception or within general principles justifying a new exception. 
         
         
        [47] In  
        Pan Ocean Shipping Co Ltd v Creditcorp Ltd 
         [[1994] 1 WLR 161 at 166; [1994] 1 All ER 470 at 475.] , Lord Goff of Chieveley said: 
         
         
          
          I am of course well aware that writers on the law of restitution have been exploring the possibility that, in exceptional circumstances, a plaintiff may have a claim in restitution when he has conferred a benefit on the defendant in the course of performing an obligation to a third party (see, eg, Goff and Jones on the Law of Restitution, 4th ed (1993), pp 55 et seq, and (for a particular example) Burrows on the Law of Restitution (1993) pp 271-272). But, quite apart from the fact that the existence of a remedy in restitution in such circumstances must still be regarded as a matter of debate, it is always recognised that serious difficulties arise if the law seeks to expand the law of restitution to redistribute risks for which provision has been made under an applicable contract. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        [79] The doing of work, or payment of money, for and at the request of another, are archetypal cases in which it may be said that a person receives a ""benefit"" at the ""expense"" of another which the recipient ""accepts"" and which it would be unconscionable for the recipient to retain without payment. And as is well apparent from this Court's decision in  
        Steele v Tardiani 
         (1946) 72 CLR 386; [1946] HCA 21,  
        an essential step in considering a claim in quantum meruit (or money paid) is to ask whether and how that claim fits with any particular contract the parties have made 
        . It is essential to consider how the claim fits with contracts the parties have made because, as Lord Goff of Chieveley rightly warned in  
        Pan Ocean Shipping Co Ltd v Creditcorp Ltd 
         [1994] 1 WLR 161 at 166; [1994] 1 All ER 470 at 475, "" 
        serious difficulties arise if the law seeks to expand the law of restitution to redistribute risks for which provision has been made under an applicable contract 
        "". In a similar vein, in the Comments upon §29 of the proposed Restatement, (3d), "" 
        Restitution and Unjust Enrichment 
        "" Tentative Draft No 3, 22 March 2004. Section 29 deals with the topic of restitution in cases of ""Self-Interested Intervention"", the Reporter says: 
         
        
       
      
    188 Here there is no question that Mr McCracken was contracting with Elite for the purchase of the property. While it was as the result of Mr Kakavas’ decisions that the sale did not proceed, that does not provide a basis for any order being made against him. The deposit was paid direct to Mr Kakavas, as Elite had agreed with Mr McCracken. Mr Kakavas said that he had spent the money gambling and claimed that this was known to Mr McCracken, which he denied. Whether that was so or not, in contracting with Elite, rather than with Mr Kakavas and paying him as he and Elite had agreed, Mr McCracken must look to Elite to recover that deposit. No such claim is advanced. 
     
      
    189 Reliance was placed on Roxborough v Rothmans of Pall Mall Australia Ltd [2001] HCA 68; (2001) 185 ALR 335. It was argued that there were three bases upon which orders could be made against Mr Kakavas: firstly, failed consideration; secondly, a failed bargain; and thirdly, a void or illegal contract. These arguments rested on an analysis of what had occurred, which treated the payment of the deposit to Mr Kakavas, as putting Elite into the position where it could not perform the agreement, because it had never itself received the deposit. I cannot accept that characterisation of what occurred.  
     
      
    190 This was not a case of failed consideration, but repudiation of the agreement by the vendor. The parties acted entirely in accordance with their agreement, until it was brought to an end by Elite, who then failed to repay the $4 million deposit it had received from Mr McCracken and which it was not entitled to retain. Undoubtedly, thereby Elite was unjustly enriched. That it was Mr Kakavas to whom the money was paid does not alter that situation. It was Elite, not Mr Kakavas, who had and received the part payment of the contract price under this agreement, notwithstanding its actual payment direct to Mr Kakavas. 
     
      
       
      Conversion 
       
      
    191 This claim must fail for reasons already given. Even were that not so, given the contract under which the payment was made to Mr Kakavas, it is difficult to see how the order sought could be made against Mr Kakavas. 
     
      
       
        
       
      The second agreement 
       
      
    192 It was not in issue that the second agreement was made; that $250,000 was later repaid and that $250,000 remains outstanding. By his cross claim, Mr Kakavas claims that $250,000 of the $1 million paid by Mr Kerwick to Mrs McCracken should be treated as having satisfied this debt.  
     
      
    193 I am unable to accept that argument, for reasons which will become apparent. I am satisfied that orders must be made in favour of Mr McCracken, in respect of this debt. 
     
      
       
      The third agreement involving the $2 million advance 
       
       
      The claimed agreement for the sale of Mr Kerwick’s property to Mr McCracken 
       
      
    194 All three defendants denied the existence of the third agreement. The payment of $2 million to Mr Kerwick is explained on another basis entirely - an alleged agreement for the sale of Mr Kerwick’s house to Mr McCracken, to become his family home. I have already explained how this defence came to feature in the case. It is convenient to deal with that defence immediately, because I have concluded that no such agreement, was ever made. 
     
      
    195 Both the third agreement and the agreement for the sale of Mr Kerwick’s house to Mr McCracken, have a number of seemingly implausible elements, although both were transactions of the kind which Mr Kakavas was then brokering in his business, bringing buyers and sellers of substantial Queensland properties together. Mr Kakavas and his relationships with the other three men lay at the heart of what was alleged in respect of both of these claimed agreements. The competing evidence must be considered, against that background.  
     
      
    196 Mr McCracken and Mr Kerwick met through Mr Kakavas. Mr Kerwick described Mr Kakavas as one of his best friends, a man with whom he had many business dealings, shared an ANZ bank account and had loaned between $1 to $2 million. They had helped each other, for over 15 years, having first met when Mr Kerwick worked at Jupiter’s Casino. They became friends when Mr Kerwick looked Mr Kakavas up in Melbourne in 1994. Mr Kerwick became friends with Mr Pilarinos in 1998. This was the only occasion that Mr Kerwick had had any business dealings with Mr McCracken, another friend, who he met through Mr Kakavas in 2003 or 2004. He was not as close a friend as Mr Kakavas.  
     
      
    197 Mr Kerwick had bought this beachfront property at Mermaid Beach for $4 million. He had not yet settled on the purchase, which he claims that he was considering on-selling the following January, when Mr Kakavas approached him in October 2006 and proposed that he sell the property to Mr McCracken, as his new family home. Mr Kerwick was prepared to sell for $5.5 million and claimed that when later told by Mr McCracken that he needed an extended settlement, a price of $6 million, with a $2 million non-refundable deposit, to be released to him immediately, with an option to further extend the settlement, for another $300,000, was agreed. Mr McCracken denied this. 
     
      
    198 On its face the claimed agreement was rather extraordinary. Not only did it deliver Mr Kerwick a profit on the property of $2 million, before he had even settled on its purchase, the agreement was also claimed to have been made on the basis that the $2 million deposit was immediately released to Mr Kerwick and would not have to be repaid to Mr McCracken if the sale fell through, no matter what the reason.  
     
      
    199 Again, the written contract claimed to have reflected this agreement was not in evidence. Mr Kerwick’s claim that he obtained a blank agreement from his solicitor, was corroborated by other evidence, but that does not take the matter far. His evidence was that he was already contemplating a sale before being approached by Mr Kakavas, even though he has never in fact sold the property. It was Mr Kerwick and Mr Kakavas’ evidence that Mr Kakavas completed the contract details, including handwritten special conditions of a similar kind to those claimed in relation to the first agreement. Mr Kerwick then signed the agreement, Mr Kakavas witnessed it and it was left in Mr McCracken’s letterbox, with neither Mr Kerwick nor Mr Kakavas keeping a copy. Curiously, Mr Kerwick explained in cross examination that when he signed the contract and gave it to Mr McCracken, he could see no reason for needing to keep a copy. Mr McCracken then paid $2 million to Mr Kerwick, without any exchange of contracts, or solicitors being involved. 
     
      
    200 This scenario seemed to me so unlikely, that great caution had to be exercised before Mr Kerwick and Mr Kakavas’ evidence as to this agreement was accepted, in the face of Mr McCracken’s denial.  
     
      
    201 When asked to explain how it was that such an extraordinary profit was achieved in such a short timeframe, Mr Kerwick’s evidence was that there was a ‘hot’ property market at the time. That evidence seemed fanciful. Commonsense dictates that before such an explanation could be accepted, some corroborating evidence as to the state of the property market would have to be produced. There was no such evidence. 
     
      
    202 Mr Kerwick’s evidence was that when Mr McCracken informed him on 12 November that he did not wish to proceed, Mr Kerwick told him that he regarded the agreement to have been terminated, and that he was entitled to retain the $2 million. Mr Kerwick still resides in this property and has never put it on the market again.  
     
      
    203 I have earlier set out Mr Kerwick’s account of this conversation, which Mr McCracken denies. Mr Kerwick described Mr McCracken’s tone that day as very violent and very, very angry and claimed that Mr McCracken threatened him, but he did not know why. He claimed that his only response to Mr McCracken was that he should ‘stick to the contract’. I have great difficulty believing this evidence, for reasons earlier explained, given what Mr Kerwick and Mr Kakavas claim they subsequently discussed. When asked whether he thought it fair, that he had retained the deposit, Mr Kerwick had some difficulty answering, finally agreeing that he put the money over his friendship with Mr McCracken, who he claimed knew that it was a non-refundable deposit. Mr Kerwick explained that he regarded this as business and that Mr McCracken had to honour their contract. 
     
      
    204 That evidence had to be contrasted with the terms of the conversation which Mr Kerwick and Mr Kakavas claim they had with each other that day, when they discussed Mr McCracken’s conversation with Mr Kerwick, about the matter of the $2 million, which I have earlier reproduced. In that conversation neither of them refer to any agreement that the deposit Mr McCracken had paid was non-refundable, as one would expect, if that term had been drafted by Mr Kakavas; agreed between Mr Kerwick and Mr McCracken and relied on by Mr Kerwick to retain the $2 million deposit. 
     
      
    205 In the face of Mr McCracken’s denials, I am unable to accept Mr Kerwick’s evidence, resting as it does on the claimed existence of yet another missing contract, in terms again drafted by Mr Kakavas, whereby Mr McCracken agreed to release a $2 million deposit, which was not to be repaid to him, no matter the reason why the sale could not be completed, in circumstances where Mr Kerwick himself had not even yet settled on the purchase of the property. Again, it is claimed by Mr Kerwick and Mr Kakavas, that they retained no copy of that contract, it was held by Mr McCracken, to whom the only executed copy was provided. That evidence was also quite implausible. 
     
      
    206 The existence of such an unlikely contract, not raised in Mr Kakavas’ pleadings, after Mr Kerwick’s defence was filed, seems but an invention designed to provide an explanation for why Mr McCracken would have advanced Mr Kerwick $2 million. Mr McCracken understood that when Mr Kerwick later made payments to Mrs McCracken of $1 million, they were made in repayment of this amount. Mr Kerwick said nothing to either Mr or Mrs McCracken to dispel that impression, an impression which accords with his conversation with Mr Kakavas, when asked to make the first payment. It was only at the hearing that it was claimed by Mr Kerwick and Mr Kakavas, that they were not intending to repay what Mr McCracken had advanced to Mr Kerwick. 
     
      
    207 It followed, as Mr Kerwick uncomfortably accepted, that if his defence of Mr McCracken’s claim was not established and Mr Kakavas’ explanation as to why the payment of $1 million was made by Mr Kerwick, after Mr Kakavas’ November acknowledgement of debt was accepted, Mr Kerwick was at risk of being found to owe Mr McCracken $2 million, not $1 million. I do not accept the submission that in this respect, Mr Kerwick must be accepted as a witness of truth and candour, his evidence being against self interest. The realisation of the consequence of his evidence, was to my observation, a bit slow to come to Mr Kerwick. 
     
      
    208 Another obvious explanation for what had occurred was that Mr Kakavas repaid Mr Kerwick some of the over $1 million which Mr Kerwick reluctantly revealed in his cross examination that Mr Kakavas owed him, in order that Mr Kerwick could repay part of the $2 million which Mr McCracken had advanced to him. Mr Kerwick maintained, however, that Mr Kakavas still owed him that money and that he neither owed, nor had intended to repay Mr McCracken anything. 
     
      
    209 It was Mr Kerwick’s case that Mr McCracken’s evidence that he did not know the property the subject of this claimed agreement, or the area was not believable. Given Mr McCracken’s acknowledgement that he had looked at the property on the internet, that evidence did not assist much in resolving what here lay between the parties. 
     
      
    210 Other evidence supported the conclusion that there was never an agreement of the kind Mr Kerwick claimed. At that time Mr and Mrs McCracken were living with their four children in a home in Albatross Avenue, pursuant to a put and call option, due to be settled in December 2006.  
     
      
    211 On Mr Kakavas’ evidence, he had introduced Mr and Mrs McCracken to the Albatross Avenue property, in October 2005. Mrs McCracken had acquired the property under the put and call option. The price was $13.2 million. In April 2006, Mr McCracken told him that that he had too much money tied up in the property and Mr Kakavas counselled him to move in and ‘touch the place up a bit’. 
     
      
    212 It was Mr McCracken's evidence that in April 2006 he had no intention of selling, the property was gutted and not in a fit state for sale. It was due to settle in November. This was their dream home; it had a lot of potential and they were keen to complete extensive renovations before the settlement. Architects and interior designers were retained and more than $1 million spent, with Mrs McCracken working on the interior design. The house was expensively furnished. Finance for over $9 million was arranged for the settlement.213 It was Mr Kakavas’ evidence that he introduced Mr McCracken to Mr Kerwick's property in early October 2006, when he took Mr McCracken to see the property, after Mr Kerwick told him that he would sell for $5.5 million. The sale was agreed and he prepared a contract that day, which Mr Kerwick signed and it was left in Mr McCracken's mailbox. 
     
      
    214 It was Mr McCracken's evidence that he never made an agreement to purchase Mr Kenwick's home as his family home; that it was never introduced to him by Mr Kakavas; that he never discussed its acquisition with Mr Kerwick, that he had never inspected it, was not interested in property in that area and would never have acquired it, without consulting his wife. That evidence certainly accords with Mr Kakavas’ description of Mr McCracken's decision-making process in relation to the Queensland Ave acquisition, where Mr McCracken told him that he had consulted his wife, before deciding to make the acquisition. On the evidence, Mrs McCracken was intimately involved in Mr McCracken’s property development business. Properties were acquired in her name and she was involved in interior design decisions when refurbishments were undertaken. Mr McCracken said that he would never decide to acquire a family home, without his wife even seeing it. I am satisfied that evidence must be believed.  
     
      
    215 I am unable to accept that in early October 2006, Mr McCracken made and acted on a decision to acquire a new family home without involving his wife. There was no suggestion that it was even shown to her, before Mr McCracken agreed to buy the property on the basis of payment of a non refundable $2 million deposit. That he would then have agreed to purchase another family home for $6 million, at a time when he was committed to settling the acquisition of his existing family home in December, as well as the Elite acquisition in January, for over $22 million in total, is difficult to accept. That Mrs McCracken signed a contract for the purchase of the existing family home on 7 November, before the difficulty which arose on 10 November, further reinforces this conclusion. It was not until early December that this contract was assigned, pursuant to an agreement whereby $2 million was immediately released to Mrs McCracken. It was not until April 2007, that another property, land, was bought at Airlie Beach, where the family later settled on their return from living overseas for two years. 
     
      
    216 That Mr McCracken encountered financial difficulties when Mr Kakavas failed to repay the $250,000 due under the second agreement and gambled away $2 million which Mr McCracken had borrowed on a short term loan, may be accepted. That he would have agreed to purchase another $6 million property from Mr Kerwick on the terms and in the circumstances claimed, seems entirely improbable. 
     
      
    217 Mrs McCracken gave no evidence about the claimed acquisition from Mr Kerwick. It was not put to her in cross examination, that she was aware of this acquisition, or that she was involved in any decision to make this property the family home. On her evidence, she and her husband had, however, discussed the Elite acquisition under the first agreement and she was aware of the agreement for the sale of her existing family home under the third agreement, when Mr Kakavas raised it with her on 10 November. Going ahead with finalising the purchase of that property, which she had signed on 7 November, was obviously a prerequisite to selling it on under the third agreement. That evidence also provided a basis for rejecting Mr Kerwick’s claim that he had agreed to sell his property to Mr McCracken. 
     
      
    218 For these reasons, I have concluded that this defence was simply not established. 
     
      
       
      Was the existence of the claimed third agreement established? 
       
      
    219 On Mr McCracken's evidence in early October 2006, his priority was the put and call option in relation to the Albatross Ave property, due to settle in December and the Elite purchase under the first agreement, due to settle in January. He had arranged finance of over $9 million for the acquisition of the Albatross Avenue property. His combined commitments on settlement amounted to some $22 million. He owned other property but what it was, is not clear.  
     
      
    220 It was then that the third agreement was made, involving the sale of the family home to Mr Pilarinos. This arose as the result of Mr Kakavas introducing Mr Pilarinos to the property. When the third agreement fell apart and the $2 million was not repaid, cash flow difficulties resulted, because he had borrowed that money on a short term loan. Mr McCracken denied that he had financial difficulties beforehand. He sold his family home in December, in order to deal with his difficulties. 
     
      
    221 It was common ground that Mr Kakavas and Mr Pilarinos visited and inspected the property, before the time it was claimed the third agreement was made, but any interest in its acquisition on Mr Pilarinos’ part was denied. Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos also denied any agreement for the sale of a property from Mr Pilarinos to Mr Kerwick and that $2 million was advanced to Mr Kerwick in relation to that transaction. 
     
      
    222 In his first affidavit, Mr McCracken's account of the conversations in which this agreement was made, was brief. There he said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Kakavas:  
        ""Bill (Kerwick) wants to purchase a property from Jerry at 89A Albatross Avenue and he needs to put down a $2,000,000 deposit. Jerry (Pilarinos) will then use that deposit to obtain finance to purchase your property."" 
         
         
        Pilarinos:  
        ""I'm going to make an application to the ANZ bank for the purchase of your property, but my sale to Bill is subject to me obtaining finance to purchase your property."" 
         
         
        Kakavas:  
        ""We need you to lend Bill the $2,000,000 for the deposit. I'll be the agent for both sales and I'll guarantee the repayment of the funds."" 
         
         
        Pilarinos:  
        ""I'll need two to three weeks for the finance application. If I can't get finance, I will return Bill's deposit to him and he will return the $2,000,000 to you. If I get finance, the sales will go through shortly after that."" 
         
         
        McCracken:  
        ""Ok, I'll loan Bill the money. I'll speak to Bill about it and let him know what's happening. I have to juggle some things around so I'll let you know when I have the $2,000,000."" 
         
         
        53. After the meeting I had a private conversation with Kakavas. Around this time he still hadn't paid me back the $500,000 for the money I loaned him to bet on the AFL and NRL grand finals. I therefore suspected that he had a gambling problem and that things were tight with his finances. The following conversation took place:  
         
         
        McCracken:  
        ""If this deal falls through, this money definitely has to come back to me. I'm concerned about it and I don't want these funds to be going to any casinos or to be used for gambling."" 
         
         
        Kakavas:  
        ""Are you paranoid or something? Of course I wouldn't do that."" 
         
         
        McCracken:  
        ""I'm just making it clear and letting you know from the outset because we're friends and I don't want there to be any misunderstanding."" 
         
         
        Kakavas:  
        ""You don't' have anything to worry about. I will control the money and make sure it comes straight back to you if the deal falls through."" 
        
       
       
        
        54. Later on that day, I contacted Kerwick and the following conversation took place: 
        
       
       
        
        McCracken:  
        ""I've discussed your purchase of Jerry's place with Harry and Jerry. I'll be lending you the money for the deposit to purchase his place. It will go into your account within the next week or so and you will be using that for the deposit on Jerry's house."" 
         
         
        Kerwick:  
        ""Ok."" 
         
         
        McCracken:  
        ""If Jerry isn't able to get finance to buy my property, the deal is off and he will transfer the $2,000,000 deposit back to you and you will transfer the money back to my account immediately. You understand? 
         
         
        Kerwick:  
        ""Yes."" 
         
        
       
      
    223 As was argued for the defendants, an arrangement of the kind claimed by Mr McCracken does not seem especially plausible, in the scheme of things. I do not accept, however, that it was the least plausible of all of the transactions here claimed. In this case, after all, Mr McCracken was making a loan to his friend Mr Kerwick under an arrangement brokered by his friend Mr Kakavas, he was not claiming an agreement that his other friend Mr Pilarinos, was to release a large deposit to him on a non-refundable basis.  
     
      
    224 It has to be remembered that not only Mr Kakavas and Mr McCracken were in the habit of helping each other out and loaning each other large sums of money, without any documentation or legally binding agreements being reached. Mr Pilarinos and Mr Kerwick also conducted themselves in this fashion with each other and with Mr Kakavas. Mr Kakavas was at the heart of this agreement between his three close friends. He was to benefit by earning commission in relation to the two transactions, income which it would appear he desperately needed. Given what else these three men agreed to do with and for Mr Kakavas from time to time, and the fact that both Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos purchased other property around this time, that they agreed to an arrangement of this kind, does not seem very surprising. 
     
      
    225 As I have earlier explained, this contest has to be resolved on the basis of credit. The agreement is denied by Mr Kakavas, Mr Pilarinos and Mr Kerwick, but I have been unable to accept their denials in the face of Mr McCracken’s evidence.  
     
      
    226 Even so, I am also satisfied that it may not be concluded that there was a legally binding agreement reached between Mr McCracken, Mr Kakavas, Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos on the basis of these discussions. I am unable to see how these two limited conversations could provide a basis upon which it might be concluded that any of these parties had agreed to enter a binding agreement with each other, particularly in the terms claimed by the plaintiffs. Basic terms such as the sale price for the two properties, the terms of the loan, or the timing of the purchases were not even discussed, let alone agreed. Nor was there any discussion about any written agreements being entered in respect of those properties. Mr McCracken’s evidence in cross examination confirmed that there was no intention at that stage, to create any legally binding agreement. His evidence was that he was operating on trust. 
     
      
    227 That there was an arrangement made between these four men at this time was, nevertheless quite apparent on the evidence. While the third agreement and how it unravelled was denied by all three defendants, Mr McCracken’s claim that Mr Kakavas had brokered this arrangement, was not only consistent with the evidence as to Mr Kakavas’ business and property dealings, it explains various transactions which were not in dispute, as well as Mr Kakavas’ behaviour on 10 November and subsequently; and why it was that Mr McCracken initially pursued only Mr Kakavas, rather than Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos.  
     
      
    228 There is no question that on 10 October, Mr McCracken (through Crackers Corporation) paid Mr Kerwick $2 million. Mr Kakavas agreed that he provided Mr Kerwick’s bank details to Mr McCracken for this purpose. It is also clear that on 11 October, Mr Kerwick paid $2 million to Illari Nominees Pty Ltd ('Illari'), a company controlled by Mr Pilarinos. On Mr Pilarinos’ evidence, this was the money he received from Mr Kerwick. The same day, Illari sent some $2,748,485.04, including the $2 million received from Mr Kerwick to an account which Mr Kakavas maintained with the Bellagio Casino Hotel. On 8 November, Illari paid $2 million to Mr Kakavas, who then paid $2.2 million to SkyCity Adelaide Pty Ltd, (which Mr Kakavas explained in his evidence operated a New Zealand casino where he also gambled). 
     
      
    229 It was the case advanced for Mr Kerwick, Mr Kakavas and Mr Pilarinos that none of these payments had anything to do with Mr McCracken or the third agreement. I am unable to accept that case. The claimed agreement for the sale of Mr Kerwick’s property to Mr McCracken was not established. Mr Kerwick claimed no other basis for any entitlement to the money, which both he and Mr Pilarinos said he paid to Mr Pilarinos. The money went into the Illari account and was then paid on to the Bellagio Casino, for Mr Kakavas’ benefit and at his request. Mr Kakavas then spent it on a trip taken in the company of Mr Pilarinos. 
     
      
    230 Mr Pilarinos claims that this transaction was but another loan which he made to his friend Mr Kakavas, using money received from Mr Kerwick, which he was free to do with as he wished. That evidence may not be accepted. Mr Kerwick’s evidence was that he paid the money to Mr Pilarinos to repay an existing debt and so that Mr Kerwick might make a $1.2 million investment in a property development Mr Pilarinos had underway in Melbourne. Mr Pilarinos corroborated the existence of that debt, although again, no document evidenced its existence. What the debt related to was not explained. Nor was there any evidence as to the property development in which the investment was to be made. There seems to have been no document as to the basis on which the investment was accepted. Accepting for the moment that Mr Kerwick partially used the money to make such an investment, Mr Pilarinos dealing with the money as he wished, was not consistent with the majority of it having been given to him to be invested in a particular property development. This evidence, to my mind, was simply an implausible explanation invented for the use to which the money was put by Mr Pilarinos, for the benefit of Mr Kakavas. 
     
      
    231 Something more must be said, at this stage, about Mr Pilarinos’ evidence. He was a most reluctant witness. It was claimed that Mr McCracken had named him as a party, only to put pressure on Mr Kakavas to agree to a settlement, which Mr McCracken denied. On his evidence, Mr Kakavas was certainly very sorry that Mr Pilarinos had been joined, claiming that he should not be there, understandably perhaps, given the ongoing support he was receiving from Mr Pilarinos. Still, he was prepared to issue a subpoena requiring him to give evidence, when Mr Pilarinos decided that he would not do so, with the result that Mr Pilarinos finally did give evidence.  
     
      
    232 Mr Pilarinos was evidently not a well man, but he appeared to have no difficulty being present in court, giving instructions, throughout the hearing, until it came time to give his evidence. Then an unusual situation developed. I was apprised of Mr Pilarinos’ ill health, albeit no details were provided and a short adjournment was sought, so that he could prepare himself. 
     
      
    233 On resumption, I was informed that Mr Pilarinos had left the building, with his solicitor chasing after him. After lunch, it was revealed that he had gone to Sydney Hospital, where he had been advised not to proceed with giving his evidence. The next day, Mr Pilarinos met with his solicitor before the hearing resumed, but did not attend court. An application was then made that his affidavit evidence be read, even though he was not available for cross-examination. Two medical certificates were relied on, which did not provide a basis upon which that application could be granted. When the application was refused, there was a further adjournment so that instructions could be sought from Mr Pilarinos. His counsel and solicitors then left the building without notice and had to be found and informed that the hearing would proceed in their absence, if they did not return. Mr Pilarinos did not give any instructions to his legal representatives, with the result that the hearing then proceeded on the basis that Mr Pilarinos would not give evidence. Later that afternoon, Mr Pilarinos’ position altered after the other defendants announced they intended to subpoena him. He then gave his evidence, seemingly with little difficulty, but his recollection of what had occurred had diminished very significantly since he had sworn his affidavit. 
     
      
    234 The evidence then given was rather implausible and unconvincing in a number of respects. I have mentioned Mr Pilarinos’ changing evidence as to the property he discussed with Mr McCracken on 11 November. Mr Pilarinos also explained that on his understanding, Mr McCracken’s purchase of the Elite property did not proceed, because he understood from Mr Kakavas that certain terms and conditions of the contract were not abided by Mr McCracken. That was not Mr Kakavas’ case. Mr Pilarinos did not enquire further, not being interested in the details. Nevertheless, Mr Pilarinos understood from Mr McCracken, that he believed that Mr Kakavas owed him money.235 Mr Pilarinos explained that Mr Kakavas also owed him many millions and that he also owed Illari and other entities with which Mr Pilarinos was associated, more millions of dollars, mostly in respect of gambling losses. Mr Pilarinos had contributed to the cost of funding Mr Kakavas’ litigation and generally to his needs, but not for these proceedings.236 Mr Pilarinos also explained that when he told Mr McCracken in November 2006, that Mr Kakavas had no money to repay him, that reflected what Mr Kakavas had then told him. While he could recall discussing what Mr McCracken claimed with him, he could not recall whether he formed any opinion that Mr Kakavas owed Mr McCracken money, although Mr McCracken was acting in a way that gave the impression that he was owed money. His opinion was simply that there was a problem involving money between them, which he tried to help resolve.237 Mr Pilarinos also explained that he gave Mr Kakavas another $2 million on 8 November, because Mr Kakavas asked for it, as he had done many times before. He believed that the money had come from his Eqititrust facility. He denied that he had ever given Mr Kakavas $2 million to give to Mr McCracken, as Mr McCracken understood. Mr Pilarinos wasn’t sure of dates, but he was aware that Mr McCracken had asked for payment of $2 million from Mr Kakavas. Still, he explained that he gave Mr Kakavas money to gamble with, although later he explained that Mr Kakavas did not always tell him what he did with money which he lent him. On this occasion he believed it was to gamble in New Zealand, although he did not accompany him on that trip. Earlier he had sent $2.7million to the Bellagio casino as a loan for Mr Kakavas to gamble with in Las Vegas, where they had gone together in October. He agreed that he had then used money which he received from Mr Kerwick, but claimed that the money was his to do with as he wished.238 Mr Pilarinos claimed that he had tried to erase this stressful period from his mind. He had tried to act as a peacemaker between two people who were completely hostile to each other. He should not have been involved in the proceedings at all. He denied ever having made the alleged third agreement. While he went to the McCracken family home in October 2006, it was when he was out walking with Mr Kakavas and they were invited in by Mr McCracken, when they walked by. The McCracken’s were proud of their home and showed them around, but there was no discussion of a purchase.239 Mr Pilarinos agreed that he had had sold a house on the Gold Coast for $20 million in April 2006, but claimed that he had bought another property, in which he was not living, in October 2006, because the vendor remained as a tenant for about 8 to 9 months. He was then living in Melbourne. 
     
      
    240 There is no question that Mr Pilarinos was involved in the discussions which led to payments of $1 million being made to Mrs McCracken, beginning with $500,000 paid in November 2006. Mr Pilarinos denied telling Mr McCracken on 11 November that he transferred the $2 million received from Mr Kerwick to Mr Kakavas’ account, who told him that he would transfer it to Mr McCracken. That was certainly not what happened. Mr Pilarinos also denied telling Mr McCracken some days after 14 November that Mr Kakavas had transferred the money to a casino. That is also not what occurred. The money went into Illari’s account and was then transferred to a Las Vegas casino. It was then spent by Mr Kakavas on a trip on which he was accompanied by Mr Pilarinos.  
     
      
    241 On Mr McCracken’s evidence it was on 14 November that a payment of $500,000 was promised, with Mr Pilarinos explaining that he had looked into Mr Kakavas affairs and that he needed to sell the Elite property for over $15 million, in order to pay out the mortgage. Mr McCracken would be repaid what he was owed when the property was sold. This, too, Mr Pilarinos denies, although he was aware that the property had been put on the market. 
     
      
    242 I have concluded that Mr McCracken’s evidence about these matters must be accepted. There was an agreement of the kind Mr McCracken claimed made between these four men. The payment of $500,000 was made as promised by Mr Pilarinos. Finally a total of $1 million was paid by Mr Kakavas, in repayment of what he had gambled away. No further payments were made, when the Elite property was not sold as hoped, Mr Kakavas eventually talking it off the market. A promise that Mr McCracken would be repaid when the property was sold was entirely consistent with Mr Kakavas’ evidence at the hearing as to his ongoing intentions, which he now hoped to finance out of the proceeds of the Crown Casino litigation. Mr Pilarinos conveying such promises was consistent with his evidence, that he had tried to help resolve the differences lying between these two men. That assistance was understandable, given what had occurred to the $2 million which Mr McCracken was pursuing. 
     
      
    243 Even if it is not established that a legally binding agreement was reached, that Mr McCracken paid Mr Kerwick $2 million, which was given to Mr Pilarinos, who used it for Mr Kakavas’ benefit when paid by Illari to the Bellagio casino was established.  
     
      
       
      The claims against Mr Kakavas 
       
      
    244 The claims advanced in relation to Mr Kakavas are brought in restitution and conversion.  
     
      
    245 So far as restitution is concerned, it had to be shown that the $2 million paid to Mr Kerwick on Mr McCracken’s behalf by Crackers Corporation, came to Mr Kakavas, Mr McCracken having title to that money. The claim may only be advanced in relation to payments made after the money was received by Mr Kerwick on 10 October.  
     
      
    246 The $2 million paid to Mr Kakavas on 8 November, cannot be viewed in this way. Mr Pilarinos’ evidence was that this was money which he loaned to Mr Kakavas to gamble with. The source of that payment was funds received by Illari from a Equititrust account. The source of this money was not shown to be Mr McCracken. 
     
      
    247 By way of contrast, it was Mr Pilarinos’ evidence that the money paid by Illari to the Bellagio casino for Mr Kakavas’ benefit on 11 October, included the $2 million paid to him by Mr Kerwick. Neither Mr Kerwick nor Mr Pilarinos had title to that money. Mr Kakavas telling Mrs McCracken on 10 November, that he could not pay Mr McCracken the $2 million he was seeking, because he had paid the $2 million to the Las Vegas casino, was plainly not strictly accurate. It was Illari which had paid that sum to the casino, to Mr Kakavas’ account there, it was never paid to Mr Kakavas. That it was paid for Mr Kakavas’ benefit and spent by him, however, is not open to doubt.  
     
      
    248 There is no doubt that Mr Kakavas was given the benefit of that money and that it was not paid to Mr Kakavas in his capacity as Mr McCracken’s agent, as was submitted for Mr Pilarinos, when Mr Pilarinos caused Illari to transfer over $2 million to the Bellagio casino, including the $2 million paid to him by Mr Kerwick. I do not accept their explanation of why that payment was made to Mr Pilarinos. That conclusion accords not only with what Mr Kakavas later told Mrs McCracken on 10 November the money had been used for, his gambling, it also explains why he couldn’t repay it and why he did not go to Mr Pilarinos to ask for the money, as he had earlier told Mr McCracken he would. By then the money had been spent on the trip he had taken with Mr Pilarinos to Las Vegas. It also explains why Mr Kakavas then acknowledged that he owed Mr McCracken that money and why he later made a repayment of $1 million to Mrs McCracken, through Mr Kerwick, as Mr McCracken understood in partial repayment of that $2 million. 
     
      
    249 On this evidence, I am well satisfied that a case in restitution has been established. $1 million remains outstanding. 
     
      
    250 As to the conversion claim, it must fail for reasons already explained. 
     
      
       
      The claim against Mr Kerwick 
       
      
    251 The case brought against Mr Kerwick was brought in contract.  
     
      
    252 Under the arrangement he was to provide the $2 million he received to Mr Pilarinos, who would use it to obtain finance for the purchase of Mr McCracken’s house and to return it, if that finance was not obtained. That would have required Mr Pilarinos to refund the money to Mr Kerwick. On his evidence, Mr Kerwick did not use the money for the purpose for which it was given to him, but for other purposes. I have rejected that evidence. There is no doubt, however, that the money was never returned to him, as had been agreed, instead it was used by Mr Pilarinos for Mr Kakavas’ benefit, at his request. 
     
      
    253 These conclusions do not permit any orders to be made against Mr Kerwick. No binding agreement ever came into existence. Even if it had, under the agreement he was obliged to repay the money to Mr McCracken, when it was returned to him by Mr Pilarinos. That did not occur. Undoubtedly, the money was not Mr Kerwick’s to do with as he wished. It was not available to him to use, either to help Mr Kakavas gamble, or to give to Mr Pilarinos, on the basis which he claimed he had. I have rejected the evidence that this was what occurred, but nevertheless, the case advanced against Mr Kerwick was not made out and so no order against him can follow. 
     
      
    254 Any claim brought in conversion must also fail for the reasons earlier given. 
     
      
       
      The claim against Mr Pilarinos 
       
      
    255 As to Mr Pilarinos, I find his evidence in relation to the transaction with Mr Kerwick unconvincing, as I have explained. I am unable to accept his evidence that Mr Kerwick paid the money to him, contrary to the basis agreed under this arrangement. There is no question that Mr Pilarinos did not use the money for the purpose envisaged under the arrangement which had been made. Instead, it was used to enable Illari to fund Mr Kakavas’ gambling on a trip on which Mr Pilarinos accompanied him. 
     
      
    256 Nevertheless, the claim against Mr Pilarinos is brought in conversion and so must fail, for the reasons earlier explained.  
     
      
       
      The cross claim 
       
       
      The assault  
       
      
    257 There is no question that Mr Kakavas was assaulted on Friday, 10 November. That it was not a serious assault, was apparent from the evidence of Mr Kakavas and Mr Chrysaffis and the claim made, which was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        19. As a result of the assault and battery referred to above Kakavas has suffered injury, loss and damage and mental anguish and anxiety. 
        
       
       
       Particulars of injuries 
       
       
        
         
          
          i. Kakavas suffered two bruises, one on either side of his forehead, emotional distress, anxiety and fear for himself and his elderly father. 
          
         
        
       
      
    258 It was further pleaded: 
     
      
       
        
         
        20. McCracken performed the acts pleaded above maliciously and out of spite towards Kakavas and with the intention and effect of humiliating him and injuring his proper feelings of dignity and pride, and causing him to be held up to ridicule and contempt before his family and friends. 
         
         
        21. McCracken, by his premeditated, repetitive and excessively violent conduct pleaded above, which was designed to cause fear in Kakavas, has consciously exercised a contumelious disregard for Kakavas' rights. 
         
         
        22. Further in the premises, the sum of $750,000 is money had and received by McCracken to the use of Kakavas in circumstances where McCracken obliged to repay the said sum to Kakavas. 
         
         
        23. Kakavas gives credit of $250,000 for money owed by him under a loan from McCracken entered into on or about 29 September 2006.  
        
       
       
      
    259 Mr Chrysaffis’ description of the assault was telling and does not permit the conclusions invited by these pleadings. He explained that the assault followed Mr McCracken forcing open a locked front gate and shouting at Mr Kakavas to come downstairs, calling him a coward, a dog and demanding his money. Mr Kakavas told him to calm down and when he opened a glass sliding door, said to Mr McCracken, “what the fuck are you doing?” Mr McCracken then pulled Mr Kakavas through the door, hitting his head on the glass. Mr Kakavas fell to the ground and Mr McCracken kicked him and stomped on his back. There was no suggestion that this caused any injury to Mr Kakavas’ back. The only injuries sustained were two bruises to the forehead.  
     
      
    260 Mr Kakavas’ brother in law then intervened and Mr McCracken punched him twice. There was no suggestion that he was injured. Mr Kakavas' father then came and confronted Mr McCracken, saying ‘Get out. What are you doing? Mr McCracken replied ‘It's your son. It’s all his fault’. There was no suggestion that Mr Kakavas' father was injured. 261 Mr Chrysaffis intervened, leading Mr McCracken away, without any apparent difficulty. It was as he left that Mr McCracken grabbed the front gate, which was jammed shut and pulled it off its hinges and threw it to the ground. This evidence corroborated Mr McCracken’s account of how the gate came to be damaged. 
     
      
       
      Did Mr McCracken draft the acknowledgement of debt, which Mr Kakavas signed?  
       
      
    262 Mr Kakavas claimed that he gave the acknowledgement of debt on which Mr McCracken relied as the result of the assault and threats which Mr McCracken made against him. At issue was whether it was Mr McCracken or Mr Kakavas who was the author of this handwritten document.  
     
      
    263 It was common ground that the document was the result of Mr McCracken’s desire to have an acknowledgement of what he had paid, before Mr Kakavas left the country. He claimed that he would not have given an acknowledgement in the terms given, if all that Mr McCracken had been asking for was payment of $2 million. I have already dealt with the question of what Mr McCracken was seeking on 10 November, preferring Mr McCracken’s account over that of Mr Kakavas.  
     
      
    264 There is no question that Mr McCracken became extremely anxious about the money which he believed Mr Kakavas owed him, understanding from his wife that Mr Kakavas had lost the $2 million he had given Mr Kerwick on gambling. That he was then concerned to have a written acknowledgment, given Mr Kakavas' gambling problems, is hardly surprising. At that time contracts in relation to the Elite purchase had not yet been exchanged. There was also still $250,000 owing under the second agreement. Mr McCracken denied, however, that he was the author of the acknowledgement which Mr Kakavas gave him, or that he made threats in order to obtain it, or that he was seeking repayment of money which Mr Kakavas did not owe him. 
     
      
    265 On 11 November, Mr McCracken spoke to Mr Pilarinos. On Mr McCracken’s account, they discussed the $2 million paid under the first agreement: 
     
      
       
        
         
        McCracken:  
        ""Why did you transfer the money into Harry's account? You were supposed to transfer it back to Bill."" 
         
         
        Pilarinos:  
        ""Harry said to transfer it to his account and then he would transfer it into yours."" 
         
         
        McCracken:  
        ""What did you do that for?"" 
         
         
        Pilarinos:  
        ""I trusted him. I thought he was going to put it back into your account. We are all good friends."" 
         
         
        McCracken:  
        ""Well what are you going to do about it now?"" 
         
         
        Pilarinos:  
        ""Leave it to me. I'll have a meeting with Harry and try to get to the bottom of this and see what we can get sorted out."" 
         
         
        McCracken:  
        ""Harry's going on his honeymoon soon. I need something in writing that says that he owes me this money. Something could happen on his honeymoon; there could be a plane crash or something and no one will know that he owes me the money."" 
         
         
        Pilarinos:  
        ""I'll speak to him about it."" 
        
       
       
      
    266 Mr Pilarinos denied such a conversation. On his evidence, what was discussed was the $4 million paid under the second agreement: 
     
      
       
        
         
        McCracken:  
        ""I want to talk to you about Harry."" 
         
         
        Me:  
        ""What about Harry?"" 
         
         
        McCracken:  
        ""I bought a building in Queensland Avenue from Harry's company."" 
         
         
        Me:  
        ""Yes."" 
         
         
        McCracken:  
        ""I paid $4 million in instalments to buy Queensland Avenue but I don't want to go ahead with the purchase anymore, I want my money back."" 
         
         
        Me:  
        ""Why?"" 
         
         
        McCracken:  
        ""I paid too much for it."" 
         
         
        Me:  
        ""You will have to sort that out with Harry but I don't think Harry has got any money at present."" 
         
         
        McCracken:  
        ""Can you tell Harry to put the property on the market? He can sell the building and then give me back my money."" 
         
         
        Me:  
        ""I will tell Harry what you said."" 
         
         
        McCracken:  
        ""I want Harry to sign an acknowledgment of debt for the money that I have already paid him."" 
         
         
        Me:  
        ""All I can do is pass on to Harry what you said."" 
        
       
       
        
       
      
    267 In cross examination, Mr Pilarinos’ evidence was that when he told Mr McCracken that Mr Kakavas had no money to repay him, that reflected what Mr Kakavas had told him. While he could recall discussing what Mr McCracken claimed with him, he could not recall whether he then formed any opinion that Mr Kakavas owed Mr McCracken money, although Mr McCracken was acting in a way that gave the impression that he was owed money. Mr Pilarinos’ opinion was simply that there was a problem involving money between them. 
     
      
    268 On 11 November, Mr McCracken also spoke to Mr Chrysaffis to ask his assistance. Mr McCracken’s account of the conversation was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        McCracken:  
        ""Can you go with Jerry to see Harry and get something from Harry in writing confirming what he owes me all the money that he owes."" 
         
         
        Chrysaffis:  
        ""I'll sort it out."" 
         
        
       
      
    269 On Mr Chrysaffis' evidence, more was said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        32. I went to see Jarrod at his house. During our conversation Jarrod said words to the effect: ""Harry is a dog. He should not go on his honeymoon while he owes me money. If I see Harry's father in the street he is not safe."" He also said: ""I want Harry to sign an acknowledgement."" Jarrod told me what he wanted from Harry to write, I made detailed notes on a piece of paper. I did not retain the paper with the details I wrote on. 
         
         
        33. I remember writing on both sides of the A4 piece of paper. 
         
         
        34. I was taken by surprise by Jarrod's comments, as I was not aware of the issue between Harry and Jarrod. 
         
         
        35. I phoned Harry and he came to see me at the resort where I was staying. Harry and I had a conversation in his car, a green Holden Statesman. 
         
         
        36. I told Harry what Jarrod wanted from him based on the notes I had made. I observed Harry write out a document and then he signed it. Harry gave me the document which I put into an envelope which I sealed. I did not read it. 
        
       
       
      
    270 Mr McCracken denied telling Mr Chrysaffis the details of what he wanted acknowledged, or making any threats. I accept Mr Chrysaffis' evidence but it is important however, to note that Mr Chrysaffis' account makes no mention of Mr McCracken asking that any particular amount of money be acknowledged. Mr Chrysaffis was asked in cross examination if he found out how much Mr McCracken was claiming that Mr Kakavas owed him. His evidence was that he did 'eventually'. It does not follow from this evidence that Mr McCracken asked for an acknowledgment of any specific amount, when he spoke to Mr Chrysaffis on 11 November, or that the amount specified in the acknowledgement was an amount which Mr McCracken was demanding to have acknowledged.  
     
      
    271 Mr Chrysaffis gave no account of his conversation with Mr Kakavas. Mr Kakavas’ account of his conversation with Mr Chrysaffis was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Chrysaffis:  
        ""Harry, I spoke to McCracken this morning and he said he wanted to see me. I went down to his house and spoke to him. He says he cannot guarantee your or your father's safety walking down the street unless you sign an acknowledgement of debt for the money he says you owe him. He asked me to write downfall this stuff for you. He wants the acknowledgement to say that you owe him $6.25 million. That you have appointed a real estate agent to sell 16 and 20 Queensland Avenue; that all funds remaining from the sales of those properties will be paid to him or as he directs; that any deposits paid and released on those properties will be paid to him or as he directs; and that he can do what he wants with the properties if you die."" 
         
         
        Kakavas:  
        ""He's lost the plot but I'm going to have to do this. I don't want anything to happen to my father while I am away."" 
         
         
        Chrysaffis:  
        ""I can meet you outside Breakers on Old Burleigh Road, where I'm staying."" 
         
         
        Kakavas:  
        ""I'll be there shortly."" 
        
       
       
      
    272 Mr Kakavas claims that he then wrote the acknowledgement in accordance with Mr Chrysaffis' 'instructions'. I am unable to accept this evidence. When cross examined about various of the matters dealt with in the document Mr Kakavas produced, Mr Chrysaffis could not remember them. Mr Chrysaffis later delivered the document to Mr McCracken, but he clearly did not know whether what Mr Kakavas wrote in his hand, accorded with what he told him that Mr McCracken wanted acknowledged. Mr Chrysaffis never read the document. Nor had he kept the notes he had made of his conversation with Mr McCracken.  
     
      
    273 The handwritten document provided:  
     
      
       
        
         
        ""I Harry Kakavas of 213 Hedges Avenue Mermaid Beach hereby agree and confirm that I owe Jarrod McCracken or related companies the sum of $6,250,000.  
         
         
        I confirm that yesterday 11/11/06 I appointed Ray White Commercial to Auction and tender lot 1 20 Qld Ave Broadbeach and 16 Qld Ave Broadbeach. 
         
         
        I further agree and confirm that all funds remaining from the above 2 sales will be paid to Jarrod McCracken or as directed by Jarrod McCracken less mortgage payouts, commissions or any other costs connected to the sale of the properties and to the release of titles.  
         
         
        I confirm that should a sale take place prior to the auction of lot 1 20 Qld Avenue or should a buyer be prepared to sign a contract prior to the close of tenders for 16 Qld Avenue Broadbeach any deposit paid and released will be immediately made available to Jarrod McCracken or as directed by Jarrod McCracken.  
         
         
        In the event of my death I authorise Jarrod McCracken to have the sole power and discretion to treat the above 2 properties as he wishes as I appoint him as my trustee. 
         
         
        Harry Kakavas 
         
        12/11/06  
         
        TOTAL OF 2 PAGES"" 
         
        
       
      
    274 For a number of reasons, I am satisfied that Mr Kakavas’ account of what Mr Chrysaffis told him, is simply a reconstruction, reflective of the document which he himself drafted. Mr McCracken’s evidence that he was not the author of this document, must be accepted. Mr McCracken undoubtedly told Mr Chrysaffis what he wanted the acknowledgement to deal with, namely the money which Mr Kakavas had received. At that time their dispute was over $2 million. It was Mr Kakavas who wrote the document in terms which he chose. This conclusion follows from various matters, including the fact that there is no question that Mr McCracken had no interest in the second property mentioned in the acknowledgement, and no evidence that he knew that either that property, or the Elite property had been put on the market on 11 November. When he spoke to Mr Chrysaffis on 11 November, there is simply no evidence that Mr McCracken had any means of knowing that either property had been put on the market.  
     
      
    275 Mr McCracken claimed that on 11 November he still intended to proceed with the Elite sale, which was not due to settle until the end of January 2007 and understood that Mr Kakavas did too. He was waiting for a revised contract. That is not inconsistent with a desire to have a written acknowledgement of debt, given the casual way in which Mr McCracken had paid money to Mr Kerwick, without any documentation; that Mr Kakavas was in serious financial trouble as the result of his gambling; that he had spent the $2 million which Mr McCracken had given to Mr Kerwick gambling; and that Mr Kakavas was about to leave the country to go to the Bahamas on his honeymoon, where he intended to continue gambling.  
     
      
    276 That Mr Kakavas acknowledged all the money which Mr McCracken now pursues, is simply reflective of the fact that he never disputed owing him $250,000 under the second agreement; accepted that he had gambled away the $2 million Mr McCracken wanted repaid and had decided not to proceed with the Elite sale to Mr McCracken. As his evidence showed, he believed that he should repay all of this money, no matter what the legal position between he and Mr McCracken was.  
     
      
    277 The acknowledgement was couched in terms consistent with Mr Kakavas’ evidence of his regard for Mr McCracken, even containing a provision dealing with the event of his death. Appointing Mr McCracken as his trustee, was consistent with the regard which Mr Kakavas explained he held for Mr McCracken and consistent with the handwritten note which he had given Mr McCracken, while they were in Las Vegas together, which I earlier set out. Mr Kakavas described having written that note in gratitude for Mr and Mrs McCracken’s support of him, at a difficult time, when he was crying after having lost millions of dollars gambling. Appointing Mr McCracken as his trustee was entirely consistent with the regard revealed by this document and Mr Kakavas’ evidence, tearfully given at times in the witness box, of his great love for Mr McCracken.  
     
      
    278 Also to be considered is Mr Kakavas’ evidence that Mr McCracken was no draftsman. On Mr Kerwick’s evidence, it was Mr Kakavas who drafted contractual documents for Mr McCracken, that being the explanation for why it was Mr Kakavas who drafted the terms of the special conditions which he claimed had been agreed in respect of the sale of his house to Mr McCracken.  
     
      
    279 On 14 November, Mr Pilarinos told Mr McCracken that around $500,000 would be paid to him straight away. Mr Kakavas had borrowed that amount from Mr McKenzie-McHarg and gave it to Mr Kerwick, who then paid that sum to Mrs McCracken. Mr McCracken’s evidence was that when he learned of the payment, he believed that it was a partial repayment of the $2 million he had been seeking from Mr Kakavas in relation to the third agreement. Both Mr Kerwick and Mr Kakavas deny that this was so, because they claim that they had no obligation to repay that sum and on Mr Kakavas’ evidence, because he did not intend to repay it, no matter what he had said in the acknowledgement. I am unable to accept this evidence, in the face of other evidence which Mr Kakavas gave. 
     
      
    280 It is for these reasons that I have concluded that while the acknowledgement was one sought by Mr McCracken, it was in terms Mr Kakavas himself drafted. 
     
      
       
      Why did Mr Kakavas make payments in accordance with the acknowledgment? 
       
      
    281 Mr Kakavas made three payments totalling $1 million through Mr Kerwick to Mrs McCracken in 2006 and 2007 and Mr Pilarinos and Mr Chrysaffis continued their discussions with Mr McCracken, about when Mr Kakavas would be in a position to make further repayments to him. I am simply unable to believe Mr Kakavas' claim that he gave the acknowledgement and paid Mrs McCracken this money, because of the assault and threats which Mr McCracken later made against him and his father. Mr Kakavas' own evidence does not permit that conclusion. 
     
      
    282 In order to obtain the funds which enabled him to make the first payment of $500,000 to Mrs McCracken, on 11 November Mr Kakavas gave Mr McKenzie-McHarg a harrowing account of the assault, an account quite at odds with Mr Kakavas’ evidence at the hearing and the evidence of Mr Chrysaffis, who witnessed the assault. Mr Kakavas’ account so alarmed Mr McKenzie-McHarg that he loaned Mr Kakavas the $500,000 he asked for, without security or documentation, something he had never done before, but which was commonplace for Mr Kakavas.  
     
      
    283 Mr McKenzie-McHarg urged Mr Kakavas to go to the police, being fearful of what would happen to him. Mr Kakavas did not do so, because, he told Mr McKenzie–McHarg, that would only make things worse. There was nothing in the evidence of any witness which revealed a basis on which such a belief could have rested. To the contrary, in his oral evidence Mr Kakavas gave quite a different explanation as to why he did not go to the police, to have them deal with Mr McCracken.  
     
      
    284 Mr Kakavas’ explanation was that he waited for two years after the assault and only approached the police after the commencement of these proceedings, because that was the first time Mr McCracken had made an admission about the assault in an affidavit. That entirely underscored that while Mr Kakavas was angry with Mr McCracken over what had occurred on his wedding day, that he was never in fear of him. There were a number of witnesses to the assault, which Mr McCracken has never denied. It required no acknowledgement on his part, to take the matter to the police, as Mr Kakavas eventually did. Even then, on his own evidence Mr Kakavas did not act because of any fear of Mr McCracken, who still believed that he owed him over $5 million, which he wanted repaid. 
     
      
    285 There is no suggestion that Mr Kakavas made any complaint to the police about the threats by which he claims in these proceedings that Mr McCracken extracted the acknowledgement and the payment of $1 million from him. His explanation of his approach to the police in 2008 was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""I didn't want the man to do something silly. I only went to the police to stop from him from doing something silly, not to get him in trouble. He faced three charges in the Southport court. Prior to the trial, the Prosecutor came to me and said: ""Look, if we drop one of the more serious charges Mr McCracken will plead guilty to the other 2"". I said: ""What is the significance?"" He said: ""If he is found guilty on the third charge he won't be able to travel overseas"". You know, with the conviction, and his kids are in Canada. I didn't want to do that to him or his wife or his kids so I dropped the charges. I didn't proceed. I let him go."" 
         
        
       
      
    286 This was not the only cryptic evidence given in these proceedings, where an unexplained subtext appeared to be running through parts of the evidence. At one point Mr Kakavas complained vehemently that Mr McCracken had not responded to an approach from his solicitor, in relation to a settlement of the matter. Mr McCracken had earlier been cross examined about another attempt at settlement, when he travelled to Melbourne, in the company of an unidentified person, to seek the assistance of a Mr Mick Gatto. Mr McCracken explained:  
     
      
       
        
         
        ""Q. The reason that you asked Mr Gatto to help you is that you believed he had some influence in these matters, did you not?  
         
        A. No.  
         
         
        Q. Well if he didn't have any influence in these matters how was he going to assist you?  
         
        A. Because he was Mr Kakavas had told me he was very friendly with him and was a friend of his and another person that was at that meeting. So I thought they might have been able to help in getting my money back.""  
         
        
       
      
    287 Seemingly this matter was not of concern to Mr Kakavas, who made no mention of it in his own wide ranging and unconfined oral evidence, even though he gave evidence about his concern that Mr McCracken had not responded to another approach about the settlement of the matter. 
     
      
    288 As to the assault, it was Mr Kakavas’ evidence that when they spoke on the phone, shortly before Mr McCracken arrived at his home on 10 November, Mr McCracken said that he had a gun and was coming to kill him. Mr McCracken’s denial of this must be accepted. In cross examination, Mr Kakavas explained when he saw from a second story window that there was no gun, he went down to speak to his best friend, because he loved him. He said that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""No, it wasn't the large man I was worried about, I was worried that I had guests at home and he was coming over with a gun, that's what I was worried about.""  
        
       
       
      
    289 Given Mr Kakavas’ evidence as to his father’s frail health, his concern for his welfare and that of his other family members present with him at his home on 10 November, that he would not have warned them, or Mr Chrysaffis, who was also already at the house, that Mr McCracken was on his way with a gun to shoot him, if that threat was made, was simply not believable. That Mr Kakavas just waited upstairs and watched to see if Mr McCracken had a gun, is not plausible, given his other evidence about his concern for his family. 
     
      
    290 Consideration also has to be given to what actually happened in the assault. Mr Chrysaffis gave a detailed account of the assault, which he witnessed from start to finish. This evidence corroborated Mr McCracken's account of what had occurred that day. 
     
      
    291 When he arrived at the house, Mr McCracken was demanding to see Mr Kakavas. He pushed his way through a locked gate and grabbed Mr Kakavas, when he came to a glass sliding door. It was then that Mr McCracken hit Mr Kakavas, while others present pulled him away and he hit Mr Kakavas' brother in law. This was an assault which resulted in no injury to Mr Kakavas other than two bruises to the forehead and required no medical attention. It was then that Mr Kakavas’ father confronted Mr McCracken. He did not threaten Mr Kakavas’ father, it was the father who confronted Mr McCracken. Mr Chrysaffis had no problem guiding Mr McCracken away.  
     
      
    292 Consistent with this description of the incident, on any view this was a relatively minor assault. There is no question that Mr McCracken was angry with his best friend, angry enough to assault him. That Mr Kakavas was not afraid of Mr McCracken, before, or even after the assault, was also apparent.  
     
      
    293 For his part Mr McCracken denied making threats against Mr Kakavas or his father that day, or in the days after the assault. There was evidence from Mr Pilarinos, Mr Kerwick and Mr Chrysaffis about what Mr McCracken said to them and what they told Mr Kakavas on 11 and 12 November.  
     
      
    294 Mr Kakavas agreed that while Mr McCracken assaulted him that day, he had not threatened him to his face since that day, nor had anyone on his behalf. Nevertheless, he claimed that Mr Chrysaffis, Mr Kerwick and Mr Pilarinos told him that Mr McCracken had made threats in their hearing after 10 November. He was in shock and in fear and that was why he gave the acknowledgment and made the payments he seeks to recover. I am unable to accept this evidence. I have been led to that conclusion, not because I have been convinced that Mr McCracken never made any statements at all which might be perceived as threatening, given what he said to Mr Chrysaffis, but because it was apparent on Mr Kakavas’ own evidence, that he was motivated to give the acknowledgment for other reasons entirely. 
     
      
    295 I earlier set out Mr Chrysaffis’ evidence as to what Mr McCracken said on 11 November. While it was submitted for Mr McCracken that Mr Chrysaffis’ evidence should not be accepted in various respects, I have come to the conclusion that his evidence as to what Mr McCracken said to him on 11 November, must be accepted. The only ‘threat’ which Mr Chrysaffis recollected was ""Harry is a dog. He should not go on his honeymoon while he owes me money. If I see Harry's father in the street he is not safe."" Mr Chrysaffis did not give evidence as to what he told Mr Kakavas, but I do not accept Mr Kakavas’ account that Mr Chrysaffis told him that Mr McCracken had made threats against both he and his father. That was not Mr Chrysaffis’ evidence as to what Mr McCracken had said. I find it extremely unlikely that Mr Chrysaffis would have been untruthful in what he told Mr Kakavas. What was said also has to be considered in the context of Mr Chrysaffis' evidence as to what had occurred on 10 November between Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas’ father.  
     
      
    296 Even if Mr Chrysaffis mentioned this threat to Mr Kakavas, as Mr Kakavas claims, it must be considered that Mr Chrysaffis was not concerned. Unlike Mr McKenzie-McHarg he did not suggest that Mr Kakavas should go to the police to report what had occurred. Nor did Mr Kerwick or Mr Pilarinos. The only person who appears to have truly been frightened by what happened was Mr McKenzie-McHarg, who neither saw the assault nor had any discussions with Mr McCracken.  
     
      
    297 While I accept Mr Chrysaffis' evidence, I have reservations about what Mr Pilarinos and Mr Kerwick heard and said. Mr Pilarinos’ evidence was that threats were made by Mr McCracken against Mr Kakavas in his presence on 11 November, which caused him to believe that Mr Kakavas’ safety was at risk, given Mr McCracken’s anger and demeanour that day. What was said was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        McCracken: ""You tell Harry that he and his father are not safe walking down the street. 
         
         
        McCracken: ""I'm going to smash Harry's head in."" 
         
         
        McCracken: ""You tell that fucking dog (Kakavas) that I'm not going to let him get away with this."" 
         
         
        McCracken: ""I'm going to stick this fork through Harry's throat."" 
         
        
       
      
    298 Mr Kakavas’ account as to what Mr Pilarinos told him was: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1.  
        ""I'd better not see him (Kakavas) or his father in the street""; 
         
         
        2.  
        ""I owe money to some pretty heavy people in Sydney""; 
         
         
        3.  
        ""I'm gong to squash him (Kakavas). I'm going to cave his head in""; 
         
         
        4.  
        ""I want my money back."" 
        
       
       
      
    299 I have reservations about this evidence, indeed, I am inclined to the view that it was more invention, designed to bolster Mr Kakavas’ case. It was not Mr Pilarinos’ evidence that he told Mr Kakavas about these threats. To the contrary, he said that he had worked to help the two men get over their difficulties. How he did this is unclear from his evidence. His affidavit was remarkably silent as to the terms of any of his conversations with Mr Kakavas.  
     
      
    300 Mr Kerwick’s evidence as to his conversation on 12 November with Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas is also earlier set out. I have rejected his evidence as to his discussion with Mr McCracken. It follows that his claimed conversation with Mr Kakavas is also unlikely to have occurred.  
     
      
    301 Even if it had occurred, that the conversation occurred after the acknowledgement had been provided by Mr Kakavas, must be considered. What Mr Kerwick told him plainly cannot have motivated Mr Kakavas to give the acknowledgement. On Mr Kerwick’s evidence it might have motivated the payments which Mr Kakavas later made, except that it was Mr Kakavas' evidence, he did not intend to make the payments dealt with in the acknowledgment. On Mr Kerwick’s evidence, when Mr Kakavas transferred $500,000 to his account, Mr Kakavas asked him to transfer it to Mr McCracken ‘to keep him from getting out of control’ and when asked if he was sure, Mr Kakavas said he wanted to avoid further violence.  
     
      
    302 This was the high point of the evidence, but it was contradicted by other relevant evidence.  
     
      
    303 On Mr Chrysaffis’ evidence, it was apparent that at the time Mr McCracken believed that Mr Kakavas owed him the money which he asked him to acknowledge. Even Mr Pilarinos’ evidence was to that effect. The only money which Mr Kakavas and Mr Kerwick had discussed Mr McCracken wanting repaid, however, was the $2 million paid to Mr Kerwick. On Mr Kakavas’ evidence, that was not what he was repaying when he made the payments to Mr McCracken. He never intended to repay the $2 million.  
     
      
    304 Mr Kerwick paid Mrs McCracken $500,000 on November 2006, a further $250,000 in December and another $250,000 in July 2007. It was Mr Kakavas’ case that the acknowledgement and the payments did not reflect what he actually owed Mr McCracken, apart from the $250,000 owing under the second agreement. Given that the threats which he claimed motivated these payments had been made long before the final payment and he was not concerned enough to go to the police, what was it that caused Mr Kakavas to make these payments? That was revealed by his oral evidence. 
     
      
    305 Mr Kakavas used Elite as a corporate vehicle for his business undertakings. It was the legal owner of the property to be sold under the first agreement. Despite the legal position, in their dealings Mr McCracken and Mr Kakavas behaved towards each other with but little regard for such legalities. That remained Mr Kakavas’ attitude, even at the hearing. The acknowledgement which he gave was entirely consistent with that approach. 
     
      
    306 Mr Kakavas gave quite extraordinary, emotional evidence about his relationship with Mr McCracken, why it had broken down, what he owed him and what he would do, even if Mr McCracken were unable to establish any legal basis for the claims advanced in these proceedings. His own evidence moved Mr Kakavas to tears at times. At one point, he lost his temper during cross examination and threatened Mr McCracken. Mr Kakavas was certainly angry with Mr McCracken over the assault and the institution of these proceedings, which he believed ought never to have been brought and certainly should not have involved Mr Pilarinos. He did not appear to have that view about Mr Kerwick’s involvement. His emotions were not only anger, they were also sorrow over the loss of Mr McCracken’s friendship, regret over what he had done and an insistence that he had not intended to steal from Mr McCracken and his family and that he would repay him, no matter what happened in these proceedings.",2009-12-17 00:00:00,NSW Supreme Court

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: On 14 April 2009 the appellant was indicted on a charge of robbery in company. He entered a plea of guilty and a jury was empanelled. On 17 April the jury returned a verdict of guilty. On 2 June 2009 the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 4 years and 9 months, made up of a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months, commencing on 5 March 2009 and expiring on 4 December 2011, with a balance of term of 2 years, expiring on 4 December 2013. 
     
      
    3 The appellant now appeals against the conviction and seeks leave to appeal against the sentence. 
     
      
    4 The grounds of appeal against conviction were originally pleaded as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) His Honour misdirected the jury by not leaving open the possible alternative verdict of larceny in answer to the jury question on this point viz. ‘ 
        To find guilt, is it necessary for the violence to have been for the purpose of robbery, that is, if the violence occurred for some other reason and the taking of the wallet was simply opportunistic, does that constitute robbery in company? 
        ’ 
         
         
        (2) Misdirection not to speculate and failure to give a circumstantial evidence direction. Failure to put the defence case that the wallet may have been taken by one of the other two offenders acting without the accused (sic) knowledge outside the common purpose to assault. His Honours direction that the jury should not speculate ‘ 
        that (victim’s) wallet might have been in some other place for instance in the living room 
        ’ prevented the jury from considering a reasonable scenario that the victim was mistaken in his evidence that the wallet was in his bedroom effectively taking away from the jury’s consideration a major part of the appellant’s defence (R v McIntyre 111 A Crim. R 211). 
         
         
        (3) Misdirection by His Honour not including in his recent possession direction on instruction that the appellant’s recent possession of the wallet may lead to the conclusion that the accused was a guilty receiver and in that event not guilty of the robbery in company or larceny. 
         
         
        (4) The appellant was denied procedural fairness by His Honour’s refusal to grant an adjournment to procure the attendance of a witness, Gary Johan, who had provided a statement to the Crown and later gave a conflicting version to the Crown and failed to remain at court to give evidence (T. 16/4/09 p 42 and 57). 
         
         
        (5) Failure of the Crown to allow for an alternative verdict clearly available on the evidence.” 
        
       
      
    5 To these grounds were subsequently added: 
     
      
       
        
        “(4)(a) Procedural fairness was denied by His Honour’s failure to put the defence case in the summing up that the wallet was taken by one of the other two offenders acting outside the common purpose to assault and His Honour’s failure to leave larceny as a possible alternative verdict. (Written submissions previously filed. ( 
        R v Taleb  
        [2006] NSWCCA 119,  
        R v Meher  
        [2004] NSWCCA 355). 
         
         
        (6) The trial miscarried because the learned trial judge’s summing up omitted major aspects of the Appellant’s defence and the summing up was unbalanced. ( 
        Taleb  
        and  
        Meher 
        ).” 
        
       
      
    6 The ground of the application for leave to appeal against sentence was: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) His Honour did not take into account that there was a long gap in the offending history of the accused ( 
        Ryan v The Queen  
        (2001) 206 CLR 267;  
        R v Johnson  
        [2004] NSWCCA 76 [29]), nor that the accused was at the ‘crossroads’ ( 
        Osenkowski  
        (1982) 5 A Crim R 394).” 
        
       
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    7 The Crown case was as follows: 
     
      
    8 At about 11.40 pm on 23 June 2008, the appellant and two other (younger) males entered a home unit at Springfield Avenue, Potts Point. The unit was occupied by Messrs Grahame Bennett and Gary Johan. Mr Johan was a relative of the appellant. 
     
      
    9 Mr Bennett was in bed asleep. Upon being woken by Mr Johan, Mr Bennett dressed and joined the group in the living room. He did not welcome the visitors. He told them that they would have to leave soon because he and Mr Johan had to go to work. He thought that the appellant was intoxicated.  
     
      
    10 The appellant became agitated. He pushed Mr Bennett in the chest a couple of times, grabbed him by the testicles, and directed one of the other men to smack Mr Bennett in the head. He referred to the two other men as his “soldiers”. Mr Bennett and Mr Johan told the appellant that Mr Bennett had a heart condition and had had a couple of heart attacks already that year. 
     
      
    11 One of the co-offenders punched Mr Bennett in the head, causing him to fall from the chair in which he was sitting. He got up and went into his bedroom. The three men followed him into the bedroom, pushed him, and kicked and punched him. The appellant was holding him down on the bed. He attempted to protect his face and chest. He could not identify which of the men did what. While the appellant leaned over him, he told the others to give Mr Bennett “a good whack”. Mr Bennett fell off the bed to the floor and the men, in turns, kicked him. One (not the appellant) said “we should cut his throat”. 
     
      
    12 The men found a tin moneybox, which they opened and squashed. It seems that they took most of the money that was in it. One of the men tipped over a computer stand, smashing the computer and a printer, and smashed a fax machine and intercom phone system on the wall. $4000 worth of damage was caused. 
     
      
    13 A wallet belonging to Mr Bennett disappeared. Before the men left, Mr Bennett asked the appellant about the wallet. The appellant said he knew nothing about it and had not seen it.  
     
      
    14 One of the men (not the appellant) started to erase finger prints. All three then left.  
     
      
    15 Police (Constables Gregory Hartge and Nick Kabouiris) attended, having been called by Mr Johan. They observed the crushed tin moneybox and some loose coins on the floor. They also observed a cracked computer screen and a damaged computer chair, and a lot of furniture on the floor.  
     
      
    16 Mr Bennett at that time attributed the robbery to “his son’s three friends” and said that he did not want action taken at that time. He told the police officers that the men had taken his wallet. 
     
      
    17 The police officers left the unit, and drove around the area. In William Street they noticed three men matching the description given by Mr Bennett. The police pulled up. One of the men ran off. The police officers questioned the other two men, who included the appellant. The police spoke to the two men separately. The appellant told Constable Hartge that he had been at Kings Cross having drinks at a friend’s house. Constable Hartge searched the appellant and found a black wallet in his pocket. It contained cards bearing Mr Bennett’s name. Constable Hartge arrested the appellant and took him to the police station. The appellant was found to have $62 in notes and some change on him. This was not the same amount or in the same denominations as Mr Bennett had told police was stolen from him. (Detective Senior Constable Brad Semken, the officer who assumed charge of the investigation, thought that Mr Bennett had said that he had had in his wallet three $50 notes.) 
     
      
    18 The appellant was interviewed, and the interview electronically recorded. The appellant said that he was on his way to Kings Cross when he met the two younger men. He invited them to join him for a drink, bought them a few beers, and then went to his cousin’s (Mr Johan’s) home where they had a drink. He said he thought that Mr Bennett did not approve of them, and the next minute there was an altercation and “they were having a drama”. The appellant jumped up, went to get past the computer, and knocked it to the ground. All three then left. They were later pulled over by police. One of the other men handed him the wallet, saying “here, just hold this, hold this”. He said he was drunk and did not think. He said “yeah, give it to me, like, I’ll hide it”. He put it in his pocket. The man who had handed it to him ran off.  
     
      
    19 He denied stealing anything. He denied assaulting Mr Bennett. He said that the other two men were in the bedroom and he did not know what was going on. He went to investigate. Mr Bennett had already been hit, and was on the ground.  
     
      
    20 Later in the interview he said that he pushed the computer, and it fell down and he thought he smashed it when he left. He said he did this because he was “angry to bring this drama here in the house”. He gave varying accounts of how the damage to the computer occurred, but each version accepted his own responsibility in some form or other.  
     
      
    21 The appellant had a cut on his finger on his right hand, with what appeared to be dried blood on it. He said that this may have happened when he punched the computer. He denied it resulted from his assaulting Mr Bennett.  
     
      
    22 The appellant was shown closed circuit television footage from the unit. He agreed that when he left he was covering up with his jacket. Initially, he said that he had no idea why he was doing that, but then said that he might have been frightened and scared that police would come to see what had happened. He said “I’m disgusted in myself for the way I’ve come across, and I know I never assaulted that man”. He denied having been involved in the physical attack upon Mr Bennett. 
     
      
    23 On 14 July 2008 Mr Bennett and Mr Johan attended the Kings Cross Police Station and were shown an array of photographs. Mr Bennett selected a photograph of a man who was not the appellant. Mr Johan identified a photograph of the appellant.  
     
      
       
      The trial 
       
      
    24 The trial commenced on Tuesday, 14 April 2009. Mr Bennett gave evidence, as did Constable Hartge, Detective Semken, and Constable Kabouiris. It was also intended that evidence would be given by Mr Johan, who had attended in response to a subpoena. 
     
      
    25 Of particular note is evidence given by Mr Bennett about the location of his wallet. He said that it was either in the pocket of his jacket (that he was wearing) or on the bedside table. In cross-examination he adhered to that, under pressure (which he resisted) to concede that it may have been elsewhere in the unit. 
     
      
    26 After the lunch adjournment on Thursday, 16 April the trial advocate who represented the Crown advised the trial judge that Mr Johan had departed from the Court in an agitated state. He had previously had a conference with Mr Johan in which Mr Johan gave him information inconsistent with a statement he had previously made. He also told the judge that Mr Johan had apparently consumed a considerable amount of alcohol on that day and, even if he were to attend, he would not be in a fit state to give evidence. 
     
      
    27 Counsel for the appellant said that Mr Johan was required for cross-examination and requested that a bench warrant issue. The judge acceded and directed the issue of such a warrant. 
     
      
    28 However, police were unable to execute the bench warrant and, the following morning, Friday, the judge was advised that he could not be located. Counsel for the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Somewhat reluctantly, your Honour, it’s a situation perhaps where the matter could be adjourned to Monday to leave the police more opportunity to apprehend him. That’s all I can suggest.” 
        
       
       
      The judge responded: 
       
       
        
        “No, well, if they can’t find him, and I’ll hear evidence about it, but I’m assuming that I’m going to be told that efforts have been made to find him and he’s simply not about. It would sound to me from what was told to me yesterday that he’s simply evading service and if that’s situation I can’t see that there’s any more likelihood of him being found between now and Monday. Anyway, I’ll hear what efforts have been made first.” 
        
       
      
    29 Detective Semken then gave evidence in the absence of the jury. He said that he understood that Mr Johan suffered from some form of schizophrenia, and that it appeared that he had, the previous day, suffered a schizophrenic episode during which he had assaulted Mr Bennett. Detective Semken went on to describe the (unsuccessful) efforts that had been made to locate Mr Johan. 
     
      
    30 The trial advocate then closed the Crown case and the judge asked counsel for the appellant what course he proposed to take. Counsel said that he did not intend to call evidence, but did propose to submit that there was no case to answer. He made no submission that the trial ought to be adjourned until the following Monday in order to attempt to secure Mr Johan’s attendance. However, the judge gave reasons for declining to delay the trial by adjourning to the following Monday. He thought that any evidence that could be elicited from Mr Johan would be “highly prejudicial” to the appellant. 
     
      
    31 Counsel then proceeded to make the submission he had foreshadowed. During the course of that, the judge asked the Crown if the case was being put as “a common purpose case”. The trial advocate replied in the affirmative. But he added that the Crown case was that the appellant was the leader and responsible for the principal violence, as well as the damage to property. 
     
      
    32 His Honour returned to the issue that was clearly concerning him: whether, on the evidence, the case ought to be seen as “a common purpose case”. The trial advocate again responded in the affirmative. 
     
      
    33 Counsel for the appellant submitted that it would have been open to the jury to find that the wallet might have been taken by one of the men without the knowledge of the others in which case robbery in company would not have been made out. After a short discussion with his Honour counsel disclaimed any reliance on common purpose. He also asked the court not to give a direction about recent possession. 
     
      
    34 The question of receiving as an alternative verdict was also raised and briefly debated. His Honour stated clearly that he did not intend to give a direction with respect to that alternative. No opposition to that course was raised by counsel for the appellant. 
     
      
    35 His Honour then held that there was a case to answer. Both counsel addressed. His Honour summed up. The jury retired at 1.13 pm. After the lunch adjournment the jury sent a note with a question, in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Is it necessary for the violence to have been for the purpose of robbery? That is, if the violence occurred for some other reason and the taking of a wallet was simply opportunistic does that constitute robbery in company?” 
        
       
      
    36 His Honour discussed the question with counsel. He indicated to counsel what he proposed to say in answer to the question. That began with a further reference to the question of common purpose. He then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “If they simply decided to assault him, as distinct from deciding to take his goods by force, and as an afterthought the accused took his wallet that would not be robbery in company. If they found him not guilty of robbery in company then they would then consider the alternative, the charge of larceny which would involve the Crown proving beyond reasonable doubt that the accused wrongfully took Mr Bennett’s wallet with the intention of permanently depriving him of that wallet without his consent.” 
        
       
      
    37 He then asked both counsel whether they agreed that larceny was available as an alternative verdict.  
     
      
    38 Both counsel focussed upon statutory provisions concerning such an alternative verdict. The trial advocate took a fairly strong stand that, because he could find no reference to it in the relevant legislation, larceny was not available as an alternative verdict. Counsel for the appellant agreed.  
     
      
    39 The judge re-called the jury and after a false start, ultimately directed them as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown must prove that the accused was in company with two men. That the accused and the two men shared a common purpose, that is, to rob Mr Bennett, to unlawfully take his property with the intention of permanently depriving him of that property by the application of force and without his consent, and that the accused and the two men were physically present when the force was applied and the wallet taken, as distinct from deciding to take his goods by force and as an afterthought, the accused took his wallet and that would not be robbery in company.” 
        
       
      
    40 He then asked the jury to retire again, it did so and returned with a verdict of guilty at 4.48 pm.  
     
      
       
      Post trial 
       
      
    41 On 21 May the trial advocate wrote to the solicitor for the appellant. I will set out the terms of the letter: 
     
      
       
        
        “During the trial of Mr Mifsud the Judge proposed, in answer to the jury question, mentioning that if the jury were not satisfied of the (sic) Mr Mifsud’s guilt of robbery in company they may consider an alternative verdict of larceny. From my recall both Mr Molloy for the defence and I indicated that this was not an alternative on the indictment and nor was it a statutory alternative. I did not bring to the Judge’s attention the common law on alternative verdicts. Some cases on alternative verdicts include: [there follows a list of authorities]. 
         
         
        I write to bring this to your attention and to request that you bring it to the attention of [counsel for the appellant] because I do not have a mailing address for him.” 
        
       
       
      The grounds of appeal 
       
       
      Ground 1 
       
      Ground 5 
       
      
    42 It is common ground that the judge was given inadequate guidance, and, indeed, was positively (although unintentionally) misled, as to the availability of larceny as an alternative verdict. The trial advocate (for the Crown) maintained that no such alternative was available. Counsel for the appellant, although less definite, did not adopt any different position. 
     
      
    43 It is now conceded by the Crown that the position was not as clear as was suggested. His Honour’s attention ought to have been drawn to the decision in this Court in R v King [2004] NSWCCA 20; (2004) 59 NSWLR 515.  
     
      
    44 Smart AJ undertook an extensive analysis of the principles and authorities concerned with alternative verdicts in criminal trials. It is unnecessary to re-state those principles or make further reference to any authority other than King. It is not now in dispute that, providing that the evidence so permitted, an available alternative verdict ought to have been left. The question is whether the evidence so permitted. 
     
      
    45 At [111] of King, Smart AJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In deciding whether to leave the lesser offence the state of the evidence is critical as  
        Gillard 
         [[2003] HCA 2003] HCA 64; (2003) 219 CLR 1] emphasises. The lesser offence is not left to the jury if the evidence in support of it is flimsy or the prospect of a conviction on the lesser offence rather than the major offence is fanciful.” 
        
       
      
    46 At [110] he had said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…  
         
        (c) The principle stated in  
        Gillard  
        is not limited to instances of murder and manslaughter, but applies where a serious offence is charged and there is a lesser alternative offence,  
        the conviction for which would be a viable outcome on the evidence, that is, the evidence is such that a conviction for the lesser alternative offence would represent a rational result 
         … Where this is the position it is in the interests of justice for the alternative count to be left. However, there are limits to the principle earlier stated in this sub-paragraph, including:  
         
          
          (i) where there is no dispute that the full offence charged was committed and the issue is whether the Crown has proved that the defendant committed it … 
           
          (ii)  
          where the principal offence is grave and the alternative alleged is comparatively trifling and remote from the real point of the case 
           …” (internal references omitted; italics added) 
          
         
        
       
      
    47 Grove J agreed and held that, in that case, there had been an available basis in the evidence for conviction of the lesser offence which therefore ought to have been left. 
     
      
    48 The question that arises may be framed in any of the following ways: 
     
      
       
       whether an alternative verdict of larceny would, on the evidence in this case, represent a viable outcome; 
       
       
       whether a conviction for larceny would produce a “rational result”; 
       
       
       (the principal offence being undoubtedly grave) whether the alternative of larceny is “comparatively trifling and remote”. 
       
      
    49 After consideration of the evidence I have come to the conclusion that it would have been open to the jury to conclude that the taking of the wallet (if satisfied that it was the appellant who took it) was distinct from whatever had happened earlier in the unit. The question asked by the jury demonstrates clearly that they were thinking along those lines. 
     
      
    50 The prospect of a verdict of larceny, if that alternative had been left, was not “fanciful”. Such a verdict would have represented a “viable outcome”, and would have been “rational”; and, while the principal offence, of robbery in company, was undoubtedly grave, the alternative of larceny was not “comparatively trifling or remote”. 
     
      
    51 Accordingly, I see no option other than to set aside the verdict of guilty and order a re-trial. 
     
      
    52 In those circumstances, it is unnecessary to deal with the other grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    53 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      (ii) Conviction quashed; 
       
       
      (iii) A new trial be held. 
       
      
    54 HIDDEN J: I agree with Simpson J.

     Headnote 
     
     
      
    On 16 October 2005 the applicant was surprised in the act of attempting to break into a car in Seven Hills with a screwdriver. On being interrupted by the owners, being a couple with a young child, the applicant assaulted the father, Mr Hardy, stabbing him in the hand with the screwdriver. He also threatened Mrs Hardy with the screwdriver. The applicant pleaded guilty to the assault on Mrs Hardy and to damaging the motor vehicle. He was put on trial for the assault on Mr Hardy, and was convicted of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The sentencing judge, Cogswell DCJ was invited to take into account a further charge of break, enter and steal committed on 7 February 2007, included on a form 1 pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), and was also sentenced for a further offence of break, enter and steal, committed on 4 January 2007. That offence was committed whilst the applicant was on parole. Further, the applicant had a lengthy record of prior criminal conduct. His Honour imposed a sentence of four years imprisonment with a three year non-parole period in respect of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm, a sentence of five years with a non-parole period of 3.5 years in respect of the break, enter and steal committed on 4 January 2007, and sentences of six months each for the assault on Mrs Hardy and the damage to the motor vehicle. The sentence in respect of the break, enter and steal was to commence six months prior to the expiry of the non-parole period of the sentence in respect of the more serious assault, within which the two six month sentences were wholly absorbed. Accordingly, the total non-parole period was six years, with a balance of term of 1.5 years. The Applicant appealed against these sentences on the basis that appellable error afflicted the sentencing exercise, and that individually and as accumulated, they were manifestly excessive. The issues for determination on appeal were:(i) the extent to which antecedent criminal history, and the fact that an offence has been committed whilst on parole, should be taken into account in the sentencing process; (ii) whether the degree of accumulation between the sentences was erroneous;(iii) whether a finding of special circumstances was warranted so as to vary the ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term;(iv) the appropriate sentences to be imposed.The Court held, granting leave, quashing the sentences, and re-sentencing the applicant:In relation to (i)(per Basten JA, Johnson J agreeing)1. Although antecedent criminal history will not affect the objective seriousness of an offence and thus the upper boundary beyond which a sentence could not properly extend, it may be relevant to determining the appropriate sentence within that range, according to the weight placed on considerations such as personal deterrence and related criteria: [14]–[21].

    (per RS Hulme J)2 Authority in this Court dictates that neither an offender's antecedent criminal history, nor the fact that an offence was committed whilst the offender was on conditional liberty is relevant to the objective seriousness of an offence. It is nonetheless difficult to reconcile this principle with statements of the High Court in Veen v The Queen: [74], [91], [108]–[110].

    In relation to (ii)(per Basten JA, Johnson J agreeing)3. Given the fact that the principal offences were entirely separate, a large degree of accumulation was appropriate. No error has been shown in that regard: [52]. (per RS Hulme J)4. No basis arose upon which concurrency between the sentences was justified, as all the offences involved discrete criminality and none was but an incident of another: [71]. In relation to (iii)(per Basten JA, Johnson J agreeing, RS Hulme J not deciding)5. There may be situations in which the primary facts as found indicate a firm basis for a finding of special circumstances. It is possible that in such a situation, a failure to refer to the possibility of special circumstances being found may demonstrate error, however the facts in the present case provided no basis for such an inference: [57].

    In relation to (iv)(per Basten JA, Johnson J agreeing)6. In respect of the assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the fact that the offence was committed whilst on parole should not have been used in order to increase the otherwise appropriate range. Taking the additional matter into account, an appropriate sentence is a fixed term of 2 years and three months: [30]–[36], [117].7. In respect of the break, enter and steal, the applicant's criminal history was inappropriately taken into account in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. An appropriate sentence is 4.5 years, with a non-parole period of three years and four months: [41]–[46], [122].

    8. It is doubtful whether the principle against 'tinkering' should be applied to a sentence challenged by an offender, acting as it does, against the interests of liberty of the offender. In the present case, the reduction of a sentence by six months cannot in any event be characterised as 'tinkering': [48]–[49].

In respect of the break, enter and steal, upon consideration of the factors appropriately relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence, the starting point of seven years adopted by the sentencing judge was not manifestly excessive, and accordingly, neither was the sentence of five years actually imposed: [101].

     Mark Anthony HILLIER v DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NSW) 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: On 16 October 2005 the applicant was surprised in the act of attempting to break into a car in Seven Hills with a screwdriver. On being interrupted by the owners, being a couple with a young child, the applicant assaulted the father, Mr Hardy, stabbing him in the hand with the screwdriver. He also threatened Mrs Hardy with the screwdriver. The applicant pleaded guilty to the assault on Mrs Hardy and to damaging the motor vehicle. He was put on trial for the assault on Mr Hardy. The real issue in dispute was not the occurrence of the assault, but rather the seriousness of the offence. The more serious offence (of which he was acquitted) involved an intention to hinder lawful apprehension. He was convicted by a jury of a lesser offence, namely assault occasioning actual bodily harm. 
     
      
    2 When the applicant came before Cogswell DCJ for sentence on 5 September 2008, his Honour was invited to take into account a further charge of break, enter and steal committed on 7 February 2007, which was included on a form 1 pursuant to s 32 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”). He was also sentenced for a further break, enter and steal, committed at a house in Blacktown on 4 January 2007, to which he had pleaded guilty. 
     
      
    3 On the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the judge imposed a sentence of four years imprisonment, with a three year non-parole period. The maximum penalty for that offence was five years imprisonment. His Honour found that the offence fell within the “mid-range” in terms of objective seriousness.  
     
      
    4 In respect of the break, enter and steal, his Honour imposed a sentence of five years with a non-parole period of 3.5 years. These two sentences, which covered the primary offences, were largely accumulated, the sentence for the latter offence commencing six months before the completion of the non-parole period for the assault. 
     
      
    5 There were two further offences, namely the assault on Mrs Hardy and the damage to the Hardys’ motor vehicle. On each of these, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for six months, by way of a fixed term, each to be served concurrently with the other and concurrently with the sentence for the assault on Mr Hardy. 
     
      
    6 The result was an overall period of imprisonment for 7.5 years, with a non-parole period of six years, the balance of term being 1.5 years. 
     
      
    7 The application for leave to appeal against the sentences was based primarily upon the proposition that the sentences individually and as accumulated were manifestly excessive. At the hearing of the application, counsel appearing for the applicant put the matter on a somewhat different basis. He alleged errors of principle on the part of the sentencing judge in taking into account both the lengthy prior record of the applicant for similar offences, and the fact that the break, enter and steal was committed whilst on parole, in determining the objective severity of the offences. This approach was said to be inconsistent with the principles identified by this Court in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; 66 NSWLR 566 (Spigelman CJ, McClellan CJ at CL, Grove, Barr and Bell JJ). These factors did not demonstrate that the sentence was necessarily manifestly excessive, but they raised a question as to whether there was a relevant error in the sentencing exercise. In these circumstances, it is appropriate to grant leave to appeal. That leave should extend to each of the principal sentences and the various grounds relied upon, as an error in respect of one sentence may have affected the totality of the period of imprisonment imposed. 
     
      
    Taking antecedent criminal history into account8 It has long been axiomatic that a sentencing judge has a significant degree of freedom from review in determining the appropriate sentence for a particular offence. That principle gives appropriate recognition to the fact that sentencing is not an exercise in precision and that a result which falls within a reasonable range will not be open to challenge, absent a specific misapplication of principle. As noted by Gleeson CJ in Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 68: 
     
      
       
        
        “A moment’s consideration will show that the interplay of the considerations relevant to sentencing may be complex and on occasion even intricate. In a given case, facts which point in one direction in relation to one of the considerations to be taken into account may point in a different direction in relation to some other consideration.” 
        
       
      
    9 In the language of House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 499 at 505, an appellate court will intervene only if it is established that the sentencing judge acted upon a wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect the exercise, mistook the facts or failed to take into account some material consideration. Further, it is only in circumstances where the court is of the opinion that some other sentence is warranted in law and should have been passed that it is empowered to intervene: Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), s 6(3). 
     
      
    10 The process of sentencing operates at a number of different levels. The first level requires the determination of primary facts. The second requires the identification of relevant considerations; the third, a judgment as to the operation of those considerations in the process of determining the sentence. That is not to suggest that any mechanistic exercise is involved. Nor is it to suggest that it is necessarily wrong for the sentencing judge to ignore these factors in giving reasons for sentence. 
     
      
    11 It is apparent from a cursory examination of sentencing cases and texts that the process of appellate review, and indeed the imposition of sentences, has become more analytical over the years. The expectation that a sentence will be explained and justified by way of articulated reasons prevents the courts from reliance upon an unexplained exercise of “instinctive synthesis”. Synthesis envisages a number of elements, which it is expected can be articulated, whether by the sentencing judge or by the appellate court. As explained in House, if it does not appear “how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, … if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance”: at 505. 
     
      
    12 A higher level of analytical assessment of sentencing may have arisen from increasing expectations as to the nature of the reasons expected of sentencing courts, but also from increasing statutory regulation of the sentencing process. (The two reasons are not, of course, unrelated.) For present purposes, the primary facts in relation to the alleged extraneous considerations were not in doubt: these were the applicant’s lengthy criminal record and the fact that he was on parole at the date of the break, enter and steal in January 2007. Nor was it in dispute that these facts were relevant matters to be taken into account: the issue was how they should be taken into account. Purpose is important in sentencing.  
     
      
    13 The last proposition is illustrated by the decision of the High Court in Veen v The Queen [No 2] [1988] HCA 14; 164 CLR 465. The question was whether in taking into account the fact that this was the second violent killing in which Mr Veen had been involved, the sentence of life imprisonment had been imposed in order to protect the community from future crimes or whether it was part of the punishment for the crime which had been committed. The joint judgment of Mason CJ, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ acknowledged “that the practical observance of a distinction between extending a sentence merely to protect society and properly looking to society’s protection in determining the sentence calls for a judgment of experience and discernment”: at 474. 
     
      
    14 The Court also noted two subsidiary principles, one of which was expressed in the following terms at 477: 
     
      
       
        
        “The first is that the antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences ….” 
        
       
      
    15 The distinction identified in this last passage acquired new significance in the light of the statutory requirement (in relation to particular offences) for the imposition of a standard non-parole period, said to represent “the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for” the relevant offence: Sentencing Procedure Act, s 54A(2). The meaning of that provision and particularly the words “objective seriousness” were addressed by this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 (Spigelman CJ, Woods CJ at CL and Simpson J). The Court drew a distinction between factors relevant to the objective seriousness of the offence and factors which might be described as “personal to the offender”: at [84]-[88]. The Court continued at [92]: 
     
      
       
        
        “For instance, while the antecedent criminal history, or the fact that the offender has re-offended while on conditional liberty can be relevant for a determination of an appropriate level of punishment where either: ‘… illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences,’ … per the majority in  
        Veen [No. 2],  
        considerations of this kind are more relevant to the measure of  
        punishment 
         for the individual offender, than they are to a consideration of where the offence before the court falls within the spectrum of conduct which may constitute the offence in the abstract.” 
        
       
      
    16 It appeared from that passage that the distinction involved a matter of emphasis or weight, rather than a categorical separation. A degree of ambivalence in earlier decisions led to the constitution of a five judge Court in McNaughton, to determine the proper role of such matters as a criminal history, in the sentencing process. Spigelman CJ at [24] stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “Notwithstanding the views expressed by some judges, I interpret the joint judgments in both  
        Veen v The Queen (No 2)  
        and in  
        Baumer  
        [ 
        v The Queen  
        [1988] HCA 67; 166 CLR 51] 
          
        as establishing that the principle of proportionality requires the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence to be set by the objective circumstances of the offence, which circumstances do not encompass prior convictions.” 
        
       
      
    17 The context in which the matter arose in McNaughton was the identification in s 21A(2)(d) of the Sentencing Procedure Act of a “record of previous convictions” as an aggravating factor, and its significance in the light of the direction that the Court is not to have regard to any such aggravating factor “if it will be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so”: s 21A(4). McNaughton held that it would be contrary to such a rule to take account of an antecedent criminal history in determining the objective seriousness of the offence and thus the upper boundary beyond which a sentence could not properly extend. 
     
      
    18 McClellan CJ at CL agreed with the Chief Justice but added the following remarks at [63]: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the question is asked ‘is it a worse crime to commit an offence having been previously convicted for the same or similar offence’ the general community would probably answer ‘yes’. Although the Crown argued that this was because prior offending informs the  
        mens rea 
         of the instant offence there are difficulties with this argument, including matters of proof. There is force in the argument that it may inform the moral culpability of the offender for the instant offence. However, as Howie J indicated in  
        R v Wickham  
        [2004] NSWCCA 193 and the Chief Justice confirms, that argument was rejected by the High Court in  
        Veen v The Queen (No 2). 
        ” 
        
       
      
    19 Grove J also agreed with the Chief Justice, adding some further remarks. Barr and Bell JJ, in a joint judgment stated at [81]: 
     
      
       
        
        “We agree with the Chief Justice’s reasons for rejecting the Crown’s contention that an offender’s record of previous convictions may be taken into account as part of the objective circumstances of the offence for the purposes of determining the upper boundary of a proportionate sentence.” 
        
       
      
    20 This principle requires, in an entirely hypothetical sense, that an offender who commits 10 virtually identical offences of break, enter and steal each of which would allow a sentence within the range from two to three and a half years, would not receive a greater sentence than three and a half years for any offence, but might see the sentences increasing from the bottom end of the range to the higher end of the range as an increasing record is reflected in greater weight being placed on personal deterrence and related criteria. The same analysis would apply in relation to offences committed on parole or other forms of conditional liberty and those not so committed. 
     
      
    21 This result does not follow as a matter of logic from any underlying principle. To treat a second or subsequent offence as “more serious” than a first or earlier offence does not necessarily involve imposing an additional penalty in respect of the earlier offence. It merely accepts the fact of an earlier offence as relevant to the moral culpability in respect of a later offence and, of itself, warrants a higher sentence. However, to adopt that approach would be inconsistent with the line of authority referred to above. It would be an error within House, on the part of a sentencing judge. The question is whether the sentencing judge in the present case did adopt such an erroneous approach.  
     
      
    Sentence for assault22 To answer the question just posed, it is necessary to provide some further background to the offences for which the applicant was sentenced, and then to refer to his Honour’s remarks on sentence.  
     
      
    23 The first offence in time and that for which he was first sentenced was the assault on Mr Hardy occasioning actual bodily harm.  
     
      
    24 It is convenient to put to one side the fixed terms of six months imposed for the assault on Mrs Hardy and the malicious damage to the motor vehicle. Each of these sentences commenced on 12 May 2008, as did the sentence occasioning actual bodily harm to Mr Hardy. In practical terms they were entirely absorbed within the non-parole period for the more serious offence and no challenge was raised in respect of those sentences. 
     
      
    25 The events of 16 May 2005, when the applicant was confronted by Mr Hardy as he was attempting to break into the Hardys’ car, fell within a short compass. The facts do not appear in any detail from the original material provided to the Court. It is sufficient to take the summary of the prosecution case, as set out in the applicant’s submissions, bearing in mind the offence for which the applicant was convicted.  
     
      
    26 On Sunday 16 October 2005, Mr Hardy and his wife returned to their home after lunching with friends and saw a silver laser hatchback parked in the driveway, facing the street. They got out of their car. Mrs Hardy saw the applicant getting out of the Hardy family’s second vehicle, a Toyota Land Cruiser. Mrs Hardy said, “I don’t know you, you bastard.” The applicant pushed her and swung a screwdriver at her. That constituted the charge of common assault to which the applicant pleaded guilty. At the time, Mrs Hardy was holding her six week old baby and her five year old son was in the vicinity. 
     
      
    27 Mrs Hardy tried to grab to the applicant, but he said, “Keep back. I’ll stab you.” The applicant tried to get into the Laser, and Mr Hardy grabbed him to prevent him from doing so. The applicant swung the screwdriver at Mr Hardy who received a cut to the palm of his right hand. That constituted the offence for which he was convicted by the jury. 
     
      
    28 In his sentencing judgment, the trial judge noted at [14]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Before turning to matters personal to Mr Hillier, I need to make some observations about the assault occasioning actual bodily harm on 16 October 2005. It was aggravated by three features referred to in s 21A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
        . One is that it involved the use of a weapon. A second is that it was committed in the presence of a child under eighteen. The third is that it was committed whilst Mr Hillier was on conditional liberty. He was on parole. I find that offence to be in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for these kinds of offences, particularly given the use of the weapon and the presence of a child. It could be a shocking experience for an infant to witness his father being attacked in this way.” 
        
       
      
    29 It may be seen that his Honour did not expressly identify the applicant’s criminal record as an aggravating feature in what appeared to be a description of the objective circumstances of the offence. He had earlier referred to the fact that the applicant had “a long criminal record”, with numerous offences of breaking, entering and stealing and that he had received sentences of imprisonment for a number of those offences: at [12]. Although the role played by the criminal record may be unclear, it was not listed as one of the three specific features taken into account by way of aggravation and it was not shown that it was dealt with in contravention of the principles established in McNaughton. 
     
      
    30 A different conclusion must be reached with respect to the fact that the offence was committed whilst the applicant was on conditional liberty. In Way, at [92] this factor was identified as one to be taken into account in determining the appropriate punishment of the offender, rather than the objective seriousness of the offence. At least by implication, it should not be used to increase the otherwise appropriate range, based on the objective seriousness of the offence. Compared with a criminal record, there is a greater risk of double punishment in respect of breach of parole. That breach may itself be dealt with by an order revoking conditional liberty, with the result that the offender will continue to serve in custody the sentence imposed for the earlier offence. 
     
      
    31 Accepting that an error has been identified in the sentencing with respect to the assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the next question is whether any other sentence ought to have been imposed.  
     
      
    32 Once the fact of conditional liberty is removed from this part of the equation, there may be some doubt as to whether the offence was in the middle of range of objective seriousness. Although there was a weapon involved, it was an opportunistic use of a screwdriver which the applicant was carrying for a different (albeit unlawful) purpose. The injury inflicted must be assumed to have been quite minor, there being no medical record or photographs which allowed an assessment of the wound inflicted. In sentencing, the trial judge made no finding as to its seriousness. It must be assumed, in the applicant’s favour, that it was not serious. The presence of the child was undoubtedly a circumstance of aggravation, but no reference was made to where precisely the child was, or what he might have witnessed which could have constituted a shocking experience.  
     
      
    33 Further, to describe an offence as “in the middle of the range of objective seriousness” does not indicate with precision the range of penalty which might be thought appropriate. In relation to this assault, the maximum penalty was five years imprisonment. Based on a permissible approach to that offence taken in isolation, a sentence in excess of 2 years imprisonment was not warranted. 
     
      
    34 There was, however, a further factor relevant to the sentence imposed, namely the requirement under s 32 of the Sentencing Procedure Act to take into account another offence of break, enter and steal. That offence was committed on 7 February 2007. It involved entry into a house at Kingswood, by smashing a window. The applicant stole a jewellery box, perfume and other items, including a television: sentencing judgment at [10]. The facts also described a kicking in of the front door and the breaking of a screen mesh door. 
     
      
    35 His Honour did not quantify the effect of taking that matter into account, nor was he required to do so: see Attorney General’s Application Under s 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; 56 NSWLR 146 at [44] (Spigelman CJ). Although taking an offence into account pursuant to s 33 of the Sentencing Procedure Act does not involve sentencing “for” that additional offence, it nevertheless justifies an increase in the sentence otherwise appropriate. Generally speaking, it is inappropriate to take into account an offence of a completely different kind: see Attorney General’s Application, at [51]-[57]. The similarity in the present case was presumably thought to be based on the fact that the assault occurred in the course of an attempted break, enter and steal, although from a motor vehicle. One difficulty in approaching the matter on the basis of a further offence of this kind is that a break, enter and steal carries a maximum penalty of 14 years, compared with the penalty of five years for the assault. Such a disparity increases the difficulty in knowing how the further offence should affect the sentence for the lesser offence. 
     
      
    36 In the present case, and disregarding the additional matter, it would not have been appropriate to impose a sentence in excess of 2 years imprisonment. Taking the additional matter into account, a sentence of 3 years would have been appropriate. Given the error identified above, and the fact that the sentence, properly considered, appears to be manifestly excessive, this Court should intervene. The sentence warranted in the circumstances was one of 3 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years three months. Given that there is to be a further accumulated sentence, it is appropriate to impose a fixed term of 2 years three months. 
     
      
    Sentence for break, enter and steal37 The applicant was separately sentenced with respect to breaking and entering, and stealing from, a dwelling house. The offence occurred at Blacktown on 4 January 2007. The back door of the premises had been kicked in, the house ransacked and property to the value of $12,500 stolen. The property included jewellery, a laptop computer, an Austrian passport and three airline tickets. 
     
      
    38 In respect of that offence, the applicant was identified as a result of a DNA comparison. He pleaded guilty. His Honour noted that the offence involved not merely the ransacking of the house, but the taking of items which would have caused the owner “a great deal of inconvenience and stress”: at [11]. He regarded the ransacking of the premises as an aggravating feature. He noted that that offence also was committed whilst the applicant was on parole. 
     
      
    39 It is necessary to set out his Honour’s comments in respect of this offence as they appeared in the judgment on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        “15 As for the break and enter and steal which occurred on 4 January 2007, that too was committed whilst Mr Hillier was on parole. I do not regard it as being a professional exercise in a way that would aggravate the offence. But I do regard the ransacking of the premises – the contents of the house – as an aggravating feature. 
        
       
       
        
        16 I do not regard the motivation of financial gain as a factor because that is part of the offence of breaking and entering and stealing. However as I have said, his criminal record is such that there is a very important need to emphasise deterrence.” 
        
       
      
    40 His Honour further stated at [24]: 
     
      
       
        
        “For the break enter and steal, given his criminal record and the presence of the aggravating factors, I would regard a sentence of seven years as being appropriate. However because he has pleaded guilty to break enter and steal, I propose to reduce that to five years. I regard a non-parole period of three and a half years as appropriate for the break enter and steal offence.” 
        
       
      
    41 While it is possible that the reference to the applicant’s criminal record, where it appears in the opening sentence of [24] may be considered as looseness of expression, the context suggests that the criminal record was, inappropriately, taken into account in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    42 There remains a question as to how that error affected the sentence imposed. The applicant submitted that commencing with a sentence of seven years, being half the statutory maximum, demonstrated a manifestly excessive outcome. Attention was drawn to three previous decisions of this Court, R v Skornia [2000] NSWCCA 422, R v Garvey [2003] NSWCCA 226; 142 A Crim R 194 and R v Baleisuva [2004] NSWCCA 344. The latter cases involve industrial premises, whereas the first involved a dwelling house. In that matter the applicant was sentenced to four years imprisonment with a non-parole period of two years and was refused leave to appeal. Hulme J (with whom Barr J agreed) described the sentences as “well within the normal range of sentences for offences such as his”: at [12]. On the basis of somewhat different facts, and given the conclusion reached, it is of limited assistance in indicating the upper end of the appropriate range. 
     
      
    43 The applicant also relied upon statistics prepared by the Judicial Commission which, out of a sample of more than 1,000 offenders (of which 879 received custodial sentences), indicated that only 27 (or 3%) had received a higher head sentence and only eight a higher non-parole period than the applicant. 
     
      
    44 The Director took issue with the way in which the statistics were presented. It was, he contended, more helpful to have regard to the sentences which were the same or greater than the applicant’s, rather than merely those which were greater. On that basis the relevant figure was 6% of the sentences imposed, rather than 3%, because the applicant’s sentence fell within a category which itself contained 3% of all the sentences. The Director also noted that, on a slightly more sophisticated approach, some 7% received the same or a greater sentence than the applicant. However, on any view, the sentence appears to have been above the 90th percentile as demonstrated by the available statistics. 
     
      
    45 The difficulty in applying these statistics is that they record punishment imposed, rather than the potential range of punishment considered to be available. In many, if not most, cases there will be factors which result in the sentence imposed not being at the top of a range. Yet, in the present case the sentencing judge was undoubtedly entitled to impose a sentence at the high end of the range, given the applicant’s recidivism and the need for a significant element of deterrence. Nevertheless, because the sentence is at the top end of the range of sentences actually imposed, it is open to infer that his Honour increased the sentence attracted by the objective seriousness of the offence by relying on the applicant’s criminal record. That inference should be drawn. 
     
      
    46 In re-sentencing the applicant, it is necessary to make an appropriate allowance for the guilty plea (which was no doubt in part a consequence of the applicant being linked to the crime through DNA testing). It is also appropriate to recognise that personal deterrence requires that the sentence be at the high end of the appropriate range. A sentence of four and a half years is appropriate. Absent special circumstances, a non-parole period of three years, four months should be specified. (If the proportion adopted by the sentencing judge were maintained, the figure would be three years two months. However, departure from the statutory maximum for the balance of the sentence requires justification: Sentencing Procedure Act, s 44(2).) 
     
      
    47 It is arguable that these adjustments constitute relatively minor changes to the sentencing undertaken below. However that is not a reason for the Court not to intervene once error has been identified in accordance with House v The King at 504-505. 
     
      
    48 Part of the discourse in this area of jurisprudence involves “strong resistance … against appellate ‘tinkering’ with sentences”: see Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; 202 CLR 321 at [62] (Kirby J). However, that language has usually been adopted in cases which, like Dinsdale itself, involved appeals by the Director of Public Prosecutions against the inadequacy of a sentence: see, eg, R v Burke [2000] NSWCCA 450 at [27]; Regina v Smith [2001] NSWCCA 152 at [41]; R v Ceissman [2004] NSWCCA 466 at [8]; R v Matthews [2007] NSWCCA 294 at [49]; R v Tortell [2007] NSWCCA 313 at [52]; R v Vera [2008] NSWCCA 33 at [26]; R v AD [2008] NSWCCA 289 at [78]. On occasion, that language has also been adopted in relation to a challenge by an offender seeking to reduce his or her sentence: see, eg, Jones v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 385 at [25]. Whether it is appropriate in such cases may be doubted and should at least be justified, acting as it does, against the interests of liberty of the offender. Jones itself involved a rejection of the alleged specific errors and a final consideration of whether the period of mandatory custody was manifestly excessive because it was an unduly high proportion of the sentence: at [11]. Where a variation (in that case one month) could be described as “tinkering”, it might equally be said that it was not clearly outside a permissible range, in circumstances where no other error had been demonstrated. Alternatively, the result might be achieved by the application of s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    49 In any event, the reduction of a sentence by six months cannot appropriately be characterised as “mere tinkering”, were that test otherwise appropriate. Once that intervention is deemed appropriate, it is necessary to specify a non-parole period in accordance with s 44. 
     
      
    Totality50 The sentencing judge directed that the sentence for the assault should commence on 12 May 2008, being the date on which the non-parole period for a number of prior unrelated offences ended. The non-parole period as specified by his Honour ended on 11 May 2011. The sentence for the break, enter and steal at Blacktown was directed to commence on 12 November 2010, being six months before the completion of the non-parole period for the assault. On the sentences fixed by his Honour, the applicant would serve 2.5 years of custody attributable solely to the assault and 3.5 years custody attributable solely to the break, enter and steal sentence, before becoming eligible for parole. 
     
      
    51 In expressing the matter in these terms, account is taken not only of the overlap between the two non-parole periods, but the fact that the first six months of the non-parole period for the assault was to be served concurrently with the fixed six month terms for the assault on Mrs Hardy and the damage to the car. 
     
      
    52 Given the fact that the principal offences were entirely separate, a large degree of accumulation was appropriate. The result was to impose a significant minimum custodial sentence upon the applicant by way of personal deterrence. Given the apparent failure of earlier sentences to have that effect on his behaviour, no error was shown in that regard.  
     
      
    53 If there ever were a legitimate complaint about totality, it will be removed by the re-sentencing exercise. Not only are the non-parole periods in each case reduced, but the period of overlap between the sentences will be maintained. The degree of overlap is thereby marginally increased, and the proportion accumulated marginally reduced. 
     
      
    Special circumstances54 Finally, the applicant complains that the primary judge failed to find “special circumstances” so as to warrant a variation in the statutory formula with respect to the non-parole period and the balance of sentence. 
     
      
    55 Because the balance of the sentence for the assault is wholly encompassed within the non-parole period for the second sentence, the proposed adjustment need only be considered with respect to the second sentence. His Honour imposed a sentence of five years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3.5 years. The balance of the term was therefore 1.5 years, or 43% of the non-parole period. That constituted a contravention of s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act, absent a finding of special circumstances. However, the degree of departure is small and is not the subject of a challenge. 
     
      
    56 Had his Honour found special circumstances, he should have recorded his reasons for that conclusion. It should not be inferred that he intended to make such a finding. Rather, he stated at [21]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I regard his prospects of rehabilitation as poor. They are not hopeless, but they are poor. I do not accept that there is evidence of remorse, apart from that which is demonstrated by the pleas of guilty. I do accept that he has poor health.” 
        
       
      
    57 There may be circumstances in which the primary facts as found, or the inferences drawn by the sentencing judge from them, indicate a firm basis for making a finding of special circumstances. It is possible that, in such a case, a failure to refer to the possibility of special circumstances may demonstrate error in the sense that the sentencing judge failed to turn his or her mind to the question. Even then, it may be necessary to demonstrate that the applicant sought such a finding. The facts in this case did not give rise to the relevant inference: cf R v Astill (No 2) (1992) 64 A Crim R 289 at 295-296 (Kirby P, dissenting), 300-302 (Sully J), 304 (Lee AJ). 
     
      
    58 Counsel for the applicant, having accepted that the individual sentences roughly complied with the statutory ratio, then noted that the effective parole eligibility period, as a proportion of the whole sentence period, either including the two primary sentences or those sentences together with unrelated sentences, gave rise to a non-parole period which was either 80% or 83% of the total sentence. That result was challenged as inappropriate. 
     
      
    59 These submissions were misconceived. First, it is well understood that where sentences are accumulated the balance of the term, as a proportion of the mandatory period of imprisonment, although comprising the statutory ratio of 25% of the final sentence, will constitute a much diminished proportion of the overall period of imprisonment. However, because the ratio imposed by s 44 is calculated by reference to an individual sentence and not to an accumulated term of imprisonment comprising several sentences, that result does not entail legal error: see Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v RHB [2008] NSWCCA 236 at [18]. Secondly, a finding of special circumstances is only relevant where the balance of the term of the sentence exceeds one-third of the non-parole period. A smaller proportion does not engage the statutory precondition. 
     
      
    60 That does not necessarily address all aspects of the exercise. The fact that s 44 operates with respect to a specific sentence, usually the sentence last commencing, where there is a number of sentences, does not mean that the considerations which may give rise to a finding of “special circumstances” are limited to the considerations relevant to that sentence: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704. The relevant considerations sufficient to justify a finding of “special circumstances” may flow from the structure of the several sentences. Nor is it necessary to rely upon statements in Griffiths v The Queen [1989] HCA 39; 167 CLR 372, dealing with quite a different statutory regime, to support that proposition. It is sufficient to note that the “totality principle” may affect the cumulative period of mandatory custody, so as to reduce the non-parole period of the last sentence. The effect of that consideration may be to warrant a lengthier period of eligibility for release on parole. 
     
      
    61 It is also important to note that the desirability of a longer period on parole does not justify an increase in the otherwise appropriate sentence with respect to the last commencing sentence. As a result, the period of eligibility for parole may constitute a smaller proportion of an aggregate of consecutive sentences than might have been thought appropriate if there had been a single lengthy sentence. The flexibility to achieve longer parole eligibility period than the statutory proportion existed under the Probation and Parole Act 1983 (NSW), s 20A(2), discussed in Griffiths, and is not inconsistent with s 44. 
     
      
    62 Nevertheless, in the present case the possibility of a finding of special circumstances, consequent upon a consideration of the overall length of the period of mandatory custody, arose equally in relation to the sentences imposed by the trial judge as they do under the proposed re-sentencing. 
     
      
    63 No error was demonstrated in respect of his Honour’s failure to find “special circumstances” for the purposes of s 44 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. In re-sentencing the applicant, it is therefore appropriate to apply the statutory ratio in relation to the sentence having an effective balance of the term. 
     
      
    Conclusion64 The following orders should be made:

        The applicant will be eligible for release on parole on 11 June 2013. 
        
       
      
    65 RS HULME J: The facts of this matter are set out at some length in the judgment of Basten JA. In short, following his conviction of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, the Applicant stood to be sentenced for 4 offences. The first in time was malicious damage to Mr Hardy’s vehicle, occasioned during the course of what was obviously an attempt to steal it.  
     
      
    66 The second was the assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Mr Hardy. The third was the assault on Mrs Hardy. This and the two previously mentioned offences occurred on 16 October 2005. 
     
      
    67 The fourth was an offence of breaking, entering and stealing committed on 4 January 2007. In sentencing the Applicant in respect of the offence involving Mr Hardy, Cogswell DCJ was asked to take into account a fifth offence, viz the breaking and entering and stealing from another house on 4 February 2007.  
     
      
    68 The sentences imposed by his Honour were:-  
     
      
       
        
        (i) Malicious damage – imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months commencing on 12 May 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii)  
        Assault occasioning actual bodily harm – imprisonment for a period of 4 years, including a non-parole period of 3 years, both periods commencing on 12 May 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii)  
        Common assault on Mrs Hardy - imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months commencing on 12 May 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv)  
        Breaking, entering and stealing – imprisonment for a period of 5 years, including a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, both periods commencing on 12 November 2010. 
        
       
      
    69 The effective sentence thus imposed by Cogswell DCJ was imprisonment for a period of 7½ years, including a non-parole period of 6 years and a period of 1½ years when the Applicant will be eligible for parole. It will be appropriate to say something later about the commencing date of 12 May 2008 chosen by his Honour.  
     
      
    70 The maximum periods of imprisonment prescribed by Parliament for the Applicant’s offences and the sections of the Crimes Act providing for those penalties are:- 
     
      
       
        
        Malicious damage – 5 years – s195(1) 
        
       
       
        
        Assault occasioning actual bodily harm – 5 years – s59(1) 
        
       
       
        
        Assault on Mrs Hardy – 2 years – s61 
        
       
       
        
        Break, enter and steal – 14 years – s112(1) 
        
       
      
    71 As Basten JA has pointed out, no criticism was made of the length of the sentences imposed on the first 2 offences or of them being made concurrent with the sentence imposed on the third offence. I confess however that, except possibly on grounds of totality – a topic to which I shall return - I see no basis upon which that concurrency was justified. All offences involved discrete criminality and none was but an incident of another. Furthermore, particularly when regard is had to the Applicant’s record, the inference is inescapable that the first offence was premeditated. The remarks of this Court in, for example, R v Harris [2007] NSWCCA 130; (2007) A Crim R 267 make it clear that such discrete criminality should ordinarily attract additional punishment. 
     
      
    72 On the other hand, the sentence imposed for the offence of assaulting Mr Hardy was not one that could be justified by the circumstances. Cogswell DCJ observed that that offence: 
     
      
       
        
        “was aggravated by three features referred to in s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. One is that it involved the use of a weapon. A second is that it was committed in the presence of a child under eighteen. The third is that it was committed whilst Mr Hillier was on conditional liberty. He was on parole. I find that offence to be in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for these kinds of offences, particularly given the use of the weapon and the presence of the child. It could be a shocking experience for an infant to witness its father being attacked in this way.”  
        
       
      
    73 However, the offence was unpremeditated. To the extent to which a weapon was involved, it was the opportunistic use of a screwdriver and such material as there is as to the extent of the bodily harm indicates it was at the extreme of the lower end of such harm. There was no evidence before this Court that either of the children in the vicinity – one aged 6 months and the other 5 years – in fact witnessed the assault. 
     
      
    74 His Honour’s finding that the offence was in the mid-range of objective seriousness seems clearly to have been influenced by the fact that an offender was on conditional liberty at the time and it has been held by this Court that that fact is not relevant to objective seriousness – R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at 187. The relevant circumstances did not justify his Honour’s conclusion that the offence fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The offence merited a prison sentence but was otherwise close to the bottom of the scale. 
     
      
    75 Of course in fixing a sentence for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, Cogswell DCJ had also to take into account the offence of breaking, entering and stealing committed on 4 February 2007 though the decision of this Court in Attorney General’s Application under s37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 No 1 of 2002 [2002] NSWCCA 518; (2002) 56 NSWLR 146 means that there were limits as to how this could occur. In that case, at [18] and [42] the Chief Justice said:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A number of propositions with respect to the process of taking into account matters on a Form 1 are well established and are uncontroversial. First, the entire point of the process is to impose a longer sentence (or to alter the nature of the sentence) than would have been imposed if the primary offence had stood alone. Secondly, it is wrong to suggest that the additional penalty should be small. Sometimes it will be substantial. … 
        
       
       
        
        … Although a court is sentencing for a particular offence, it takes into account the matters for which guilt had been admitted with a view to increasing the penalty… by giving greater weight to two elements which are always material in the sentencing process. The first is the need for personal deterrence, which the commission of the other offences will frequently indicate, ought to be given greater weight by reason of the course of conduct in which the accused has engaged. The second is the community’s entitlement to extract retribution for serious offences when there are other offences for which no punishment has in fact been imposed. These elements are entitled to greater weight than they may otherwise be given when sentencing for the primary offence. …” 
        
       
      
    76 Particularly given the Applicant’s record and the offence committed in January 2007, it is clear that personal deterrence was a factor entitled to substantial weight in the sentencing process although, given the fact that the sentences on the other offences could be expected to also reflect factors of personal deterrence and operate as such, undue weight on this factor had to be avoided.  
     
      
    77 Retribution was also entitled to substantial weight, a view confirmed by some of the remarks quoted in R v Harris from R v Hayes (1984) 1 NSWLR 740 at 742 and R v Scott [1999] NSWCCA 434. 
     
      
    78 An appropriate sentence for the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence, taking account of the offence on 4 February 2007, was 2 years imprisonment. Because I propose that this not be the last of the Applicant’s sentences, I would not divide that period into non-parole and balance of term periods but impose a fixed term of imprisonment of 1½ years.  
     
      
    79 I turn then to the break, enter and steal offence committed on 4 January 2007. As has been said, the sentence imposed on this offence was imprisonment for a period of 5 years, including a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months. In arriving at this sentence, Cogswell DCJ commenced with a period of 7 years and reduced it by 2 years on account of the Applicant’s plea of guilty. Some of his Honour’s remarks concerning this offence and the Applicant bear repetition:- 
     
      
       
        
        “15. As for the break and enter and steal which occurred on 4 January 2007, that too was committed whilst Mr Hillier was on parole. I do not regard it as being a professional exercise in a way that would aggravate the offence. But I do regard the ransacking of the premises – the contents of the house – as an aggravating feature. 
        
       
       
        
        16. I do not regard the motivation of financial gain as a factor because that is part of the offence of breaking and entering and stealing. However, as I have said, his criminal record is such that there is a very important need to emphasise deterrence.  
        
       
       
        
        17. There is a pre-sentence report… It noted an extensive history of involvement with the Probation and Parole Service. It says despite his associate with the service he has continued to embark on a lifestyle of drug use and offending behaviour. It notes that his record reflects numerous breaches and revocations of the opportunity to participate in parole supervision.” 
        
       
       
        
        18. His education was interrupted, he did not consistently attend school. He has been employed only once for about 4 months. Drug abuse is a significant feature of his personal history. He commenced using cannabis aged 10. He stayed on amphetamines at the age of 13 and moved onto heroin at the age of 14. … he says that the attempt to break into the car which occurred on 16 October 2005 was in order to support his partner’s drug habit. 
        
       
       
        
        19. The report notes that he has struggled to cope with changes to society when he is released from custody… 
        
       
       
        
        21. I regard his prospects of rehabilitation as poor. They are not hopeless, but they are poor. I do not accept that there is evidence of remorse, apart from that which is demonstrated by the pleas of guilty. I do accept that he has poor health. 
        
       
       
        
        24. For the break, enter and steal, given his criminal record and the presence of the aggravating factors, I would regard a sentence of 7 years as being appropriate. However, because he has pleaded guilty to the break, enter and steal, I propose to reduce that to 5 years. I regard a non-parole period of 3 ½ years as appropriate for the break, enter and steal offence. 
        
       
      
    80 Counsel for the Applicant submitted that Cogswell DCJ took into account the Applicant’s criminal record in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. I do not agree. Certainly, his Honour did not divide his remarks into some dealing with objective seriousness and others dealing with subjective matters but his Honour’s remarks when dealing with the break enter and steal offence provide no grounds for thinking that he did otherwise than follow the course that sentencing judges for years followed and which was referred to by this Court in R v Way at [93] and [98] and implicitly recognised in [99] as a permissible course in the case of offences not the subject of standard non-parole periods. 
     
      
    81 Nor am I prepared to infer from the fact that the sentence for this offence is, by comparison with the statistics, a heavy one that Cogswell DCJ regarded the Applicant’s criminal record as relevant to the objective gravity of the offence. There are other equally likely explanations for the result. 
     
      
    82 Was the sentence imposed for this offence manifestly excessive? There is no doubt that the Applicant’s subjective circumstances argued for a sentence at or very close to the top of any available range. He was born in April 1971 and was thus 37 at the time he was sentenced by Cogswell DCJ. His criminal history was extensive. It included two occasions when the Applicant resisted arrest, two of assault and one of using an offensive weapon to prevent lawful apprehension. The penalties imposed on the first four of these offences were such that they can be disregarded but the penalty imposed on the fifth – imprisonment for 2 years including a non-parole period of 8 months – suggests that offence was by no means trivial and should have provided a warning to the Applicant against any offences of violence.  
     
      
    83 More significant however is the Applicant’s record for dishonesty. He had been sentenced in the Childrens’ Court on numerous occasions including 9 when he was dealt with for at least 15 offences of dishonesty and in the Local, District or Drug Courts prior to December 2004 on 11 occasions when he was sentenced for 28 offences of dishonesty. These latter included 10 of breaking and entering and stealing or with an intent to steal, 4 of receiving or having goods in custody and 10 involving the theft or illegal use of motor vehicles. The longest individual sentences imposed were of 6 years (including a non-parole period of 3½ years) imposed in March 1989 for armed robbery, and 5½ years (including a non-parole period of 3 ½ years) imposed in April 1999 for aggravated break, enter and steal. He is someone to whom the words of the High Court in Veen v The Queen (No 2) (1988) 164 CLR 465 at 477 are apposite:- 
     
      
       
        
        The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offence is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. 
        
       
      
    84 Clearly the Applicant is a recidivist, who has chosen or been unable to learn from his past experience with the courts and the punishments imposed on him. However, insofar as any inability is due to his drug addiction – and there is no evidence of any other cause – when account is taken of the number of chances that have been afforded the Applicant to free himself of addiction, I do not regard that as a mitigating factor - see also R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111 at [171] et seq; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at 381 et seq.  
     
      
    85 Furthermore, at the time of his offence the Applicant was on parole having been released to that circumstance less than 2 weeks earlier, viz on 23 December 2006. This Court has made clear on numerous occasions that the commission of offences while on conditional liberty is a seriously aggravating circumstance.  
     
      
    86 Recognition should be afforded to the other factors to which Cogswell DCJ referred although it should also be mentioned that, prior to his acknowledgement of involvement in the breaking, entering and stealing offences, the Applicant had been linked to those offences by DNA comparison and, given the discount known to be available for a plea, it is impossible to regard those pleas as any evidence of remorse – see R v Derbas [2003] NSWCCA 44 at [22]; R v Opa [2004] NSWCCA 464 at [21]; O’Sullivan v R [2006] NSWCCA 368 at [15] – [17]. This Court does not have any evidence of the circumstances that led to the Applicant’s pleas on the other charges and accordingly I am prepared to assume that they provided some evidence favourable to the Applicant on the topic.  
     
      
    87 It should also be noted that there was nothing to suggest that the Applicant’s poor health would make his time in prison harder.  
     
      
    88 I find it impossible to avoid the conclusion that very probably the Applicant will continue to prey on the rest of the community for the balance of his life and in the circumstances to which I have referred regard a sentence at or very close to the top of any available range as the sentence that should be imposed. 
     
      
    89 Of course, it is not permissible to impose a sentence exceeding that which is appropriate for a crime merely to protect society – Veen v The Queen (No 2) at 473. Furthermore, in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242 at [15]; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 at 572 this Court laid down (or reaffirmed) that “a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the gravity of the crime, having regard to its objective circumstances.” In that case and in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; (2004) 60 NSWLR 168, the Court identified factors which did or did not constitute such objective circumstances. 
     
      
    90 Those that do include “the actus reus, the consequences of the (offending) conduct, and those factors that might properly have been said to have impinged on the mens rea of the offender” – R v Way at [85]; “matters of motivation (for example provocation, robbery to feed a drug addiction), mental state (for example, intention is more serious than recklessness), and mental illness, or intellectual disability, where that is causally related to the commission of the offence, in so far as the offender’s capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise powers of control has been affected” – R v Way at [86];  
     
      
    91 Those that do not include “matters which may be said to explain or influence the conduct of the offender or otherwise impinge on her or his moral culpability, for example, youth or prior sexual abuse” – R v Way at [86]; prior convictions – R v McNaughton at [24], R v Way at [92]; and re-offending while on conditional liberty – R v Way at [92 – 99]. 
     
      
    92 In R v Johnson [2004] NSWCCA 140 at [33] Simpson J with the concurrence of the other members of the Court held that prevalence also had no bearing on the assessment of the objective gravity of an offence.  
     
      
    93 Attention is, of course, required to the terms of the statutory provision constituting the offence. Section 112 of the Crimes Act, against which the Applicant offended, so far as is presently relevant provides that, unless the offence is committed in defined circumstances of aggravation or special aggravation when an offender is liable to a higher penalty:- 
     
      
       
        
         
        (1) A person who: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) breaks and enters any dwelling-house or other building and commits any serious indictable offence therein, or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) being in any dwelling-house or other building commits any serious indictable offence therein and breaks out of the dwelling-house or other building, 
        
       
       
        
        is guilty of an offence and liable to imprisonment for 14 years. 
        
       
      
    94 The reference to “any serious indictable offence”, encompassing as it does any offence that is punishable by life or for a term of 5 years or more – Crimes Act, s4 – means that the 14 years maximum is less than usually useful as an indicator, particularly as stealing - larceny and for which the maximum penalty is 5 years imprisonment - is one of the less serious indictable offences – see R v Ponfield [1999] NSWCCA 435 at [19]; (1999) 48 NSWLR 327. Of course, there are few of the more serious indictable offences that would not amount to or involve circumstances of aggravation or special aggravation, expressions that include corporal violence, the intentional or reckless infliction of actual bodily harm, and deprivation of liberty but there is at least one – demanding property with menaces under s99 – and for which the maximum penalty is, depending on the circumstances, 10 or 14 years that does. 
     
      
    95 Even when the serious indictable is confined to stealing, there is potential for wide variation in the seriousness of that element. At one extreme, the property stolen may have little value and be easily replaced. At the other, it may be a family heirloom and practically irreplaceable or worth, for example in the case of a bank, millions of dollars. Even in the case of a dwelling house, the value of property stolen may well run into 6 figures.  
     
      
    96 Of course, there are also the elements of breaking and entering and the nature of the property subject to those actions. The elements of breaking and entering are, in themselves reasonably limited in their ambit of operation although obviously there is scope for variation between, for example, simply pushing wider a door that is ajar, jemmying a door open with some but little damage and substantially damaging it or some other part of the building. The nature of the building is calculated also to vary the seriousness of an offence. Absent some unusual features, entering a garden shed could not be regarded as of itself particularly serious while entering a dwelling house may reasonably be regarded as at or close the other extreme. Particularly combined with a forced breaking, the entering of a dwelling house involves not just an interference with physical property but a violation of a victim’s privacy and security. Remarks quoted or referred to in R v Harris and R v Ponfield make clear that the breaking and entering alone are serious ingredients of the offence. 
     
      
    97 Such remarks derive support from the terms of s111(1) and s113(1) of the Crimes Act. The first of these renders it an offence punishable by 10 years imprisonment simply to enter a dwelling house with intent to commit a serious indictable offence without in fact committing one. Section 113(1) makes it an offence punishable by 10 years imprisonment to break and enter any dwelling house or other building, again simply with an intent to commit any serious indictable offence. 
     
      
    98 Against the background of these sorts of considerations, where does the objective seriousness of the Applicant offence place it? Counsel for the Applicant correctly described it as an unremarkable break and enter, save that the value of the property stolen was higher than usual, some $12,610. During daylight hours, the Applicant had kicked in the back door, damaging the doorjamb and lock, ransacked the premises and stolen a variety of items including a laptop computer, 3 airline tickets, an Australian passport, and jewellery. 
     
      
    99 The fact that the serious offence was (merely) stealing argues against anything like the 14 years maximum. The fact that the value of the property stolen was (merely) some $12,610 leads me to the view that it was relatively low by comparison with a worst case than involved stealing although one should also recognise that there was damage to the door that no doubt cost something to fix. The ransacking of the house should fairly be regarded as further damage although again I would not regard this as high on any relevant scale. 
     
      
    100 In addition there were the serious elements of breaking and entering with their incidence of violation. 
     
      
    101 Together, all of these matters lead me to the view that the objective seriousness of the offence justified a sentence of 7 years imprisonment. I have earlier expressed the view that the subjective circumstances of the Applicant and his offending justify a sentence at or very close to the top of any available range and in combination these views lead to the conclusion that Cogswell DCJ’s starting point of 7 years for the sentence on the break, enter and steal charge was not manifestly excessive. It follows that neither was the sentence of 5 years actually imposed for this offence and, although it may be necessary to alter the starting date for this sentence, otherwise the appeal against it should be dismissed. 
     
      
    102 I should add that in arriving at the figure of 7 years, I have not been influenced by the statistics or the sentences imposed in prior cases. Summaries of some of those are set out in the judgment in R v Harris to which I was a party. Many, if not all of those earlier sentence will, or at least may, have been the product of mixing together subjective and objective factors in a way proscribed by R v McNaughton. Furthermore, particularly against the background of s111(1) and s113(1), one might be permitted to wonder whether in many of those cases enough weight has been given to the elements of breaking and entering.  
     
      
    103 In the result, the sentences I favour are:- 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Malicious damage – imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii)  
        Assault occasioning actual bodily harm – imprisonment for a fixed term of 1½ years; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii)  
        Common assault on Mrs Hardy - imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv)  
        Breaking, entering and stealing – the sentence imposed by Cogswell DCJ, viz. imprisonment for a period of 5 years. 
        
       
      
    104 The periods listed total 7½ years. However the principal of totality means that the sentences on the 4 offences should not simply be accumulated and on that ground I would reduce the effective sentence on the Applicant to 6½ years. Because Cogswell DCJ made the sentences for malicious damage, the assault on Mrs Hardy and the assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Mr Hardy concurrent and there was no challenge to this during the hearing of the appeal, I would allow that situation to remain although regarding it as effecting sufficient reduction on the grounds of totality from the simple aggregation of all of the sentences. There should be some division of the sentence on the fourth mentioned offence into a non-parole period and balance of term when the Applicant will be eligible for parole. The fact of accumulation of sentences is a special circumstance and I would not interfere Cogswell DCJ’s division of the fourth term into a non-parole period of 3½ years and a balance of term of 1½ years.  
     
      
    105 The other members of the Court have taken the view that, in determining that the sentence for the breaking, entering and stealing offence should be 5 years, Cogswell DCJ (wrongly) took into account the Applicant’s criminal record in determining the objective seriousness of the offence. Had I taken that view, in the circumstances of this case I would nevertheless not have interfered with the sentence. Having regard to the discretionary nature of sentencing and to the fact that in any particular case there is not merely one but a range of sentences that are proper, I would not take the view that, within the terms of s6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, “some other sentence, whether more or less severe is warranted in law and should have been passed”. 
     
      
    106 I said that I would return to the topic of the commencing date of 12 May 2008 selected by Cogswell DCJ. That was agreed by counsel before his Honour as the first date upon which the Applicant was in custody solely referable to the subject offences. Immediately prior to that date the Applicant had been serving sentences for, inter alia, larceny and taking and driving a conveyance without the consent of the owner, the first of which sentences commenced on 14 February 2007. On 1 March 2007 the Parole Board had revoked the Applicant’s then parole requiring him to serve a balance of parole from 13 February to 30 December 2007. Although the effect of all this is that prior to the expiration of the custodial period I propose, the Applicant will have been in custody for a continuous period of 5 years and 9 months, given the seriousness of his offending and his abuse of parole, I am not disposed to extend the balance of term further than I have indicated. 
     
      
    107 Before I conclude, I would add this. Particularly as the contrary was not argued, I have thought it appropriate to follow what this Court has said in R v Way and R v McNaughton, and not, for example in In Re Attorney-General’s Application [No 1] under s26 of the Criminal Procedure Act; R v Ponfield and Others [1999] NSWCCA 435; (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 at [48]. The first of these cases was concerned with the expression “objective seriousness” in s54A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the second with what was said to be the principle that a sentence should not exceed what is proportionate to the gravity of a crime having regard to is “objective circumstances”. Although obviously the similarity in terminology provides an incentive to meld the two concepts, I am by no means sure that that is justified. “Objective seriousness” in the context of s54A may more readily exclude the mental state of the offender than does the expression “objective circumstances” for, as was said in Edington v Fitzmaurice (1885) 29 Ch D 459 at 483, “the state of a man’s mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion”.  
     
      
    108 Furthermore, with due deference to the five judges who participated in the decision in R v McNaughton, I find a deal of what said in that case impossible to reconcile with what the majority of the High Court said in Veen v The Queen (No 2) at 477-478: viz: 
     
      
       
        
        “… The antecedent criminal history of an offender is a factor which may be taken into account in determining the sentence to be imposed, but it cannot be given such weight as to lead to the imposition of a penalty which is disproportionate to the gravity of the instant offence. To do so would be to impose a fresh penalty for past offences:  
        Director of Public Prosecutions v Ottewell 
         (1970) AC 642 at p650. The antecedent criminal history is relevant, however, to show whether the instant offences is an uncharacteristic aberration or whether the offender has manifested in his commission of the instant offence a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law. In the latter case, retribution, deterrence and protection of society may all indicate that a more severe penalty is warranted. It is legitimate to take account of the antecedent criminal history when it illuminates the moral culpability of the offender in the instant case, or shows his dangerous propensity or shows a need to impose condign punishment to deter the offender and other offenders from committing further offences of a like kind. Counsel for the applicant submitted that antecedent criminal history was relevant only to a prisoner’s claim for leniency. That is not and has never been the approach of the courts in this country and it would be at odds with the community’s understanding of what is relevant to the assessment of criminal penalties.” 
        
       
      
    109 I, and I suspect most people, would regard an offence as more grave than otherwise if committed pursuant to a continuing attitude of disobedience of the law (rather than an uncharacteristic aberration), or in breach of a grant of conditional liberty or otherwise attendant with a higher degree of moral culpability. Their Honour’s reference to “the community’s understanding of what is relevant to the assessment of criminal penalties” is an indication that those judges thought the same. Furthermore, once the contention that antecedent criminal history was relevant only to a claim for leniency, i.e. reducing or possibly reducing a sentence from what would otherwise be appropriate, was rejected, it follows that that history could be used to increase it from that level, so long as the increase did not result in a sentence disproportionate to the gravity judged by, inter alia, the matters mentioned in the passage, including moral culpability. 
     
      
    110 The effect of the decision in R v McNaughton is to remove as a factor relevant to the objective circumstances of an offence, and thus the maximum penalty that case permits, part of the moral culpability of an offender. I cannot accept that such a result is correct.  
     
      
    111 I have recorded that in R v Way, at [85–86] it was said that “those factors that might properly have been said to have impinged on the mens rea of the offender”, “matters of motivation (for example provocation, robbery to feed a drug addiction), mental state (for example, intention is more serious than recklessness), and mental illness, or intellectual disability, where that is causally related to the commission of the offence, in so far as the offender’s capacity to reason, or to appreciate fully the rightness or wrongness of a particular act, or to exercise powers of control has been affected” could be taken into account in assessing objective seriousness but that “matters which may be said to explain or influence the conduct of the offender or otherwise impinge on her or his moral culpability, for example, youth or prior sexual abuse” could not. I have wondered whether, within the former category or by analogy one could include, not convictions or conditional liberty as such, but any “continuing attitude of disobedience” to be inferred from those convictions (or conditional liberty) and the subject offence. However, I have taken the view that to do so would be too much of a refinement in the practical operation of the criminal law to be consistent with R v Way and R v McNaughton. 
     
      
    112 This appeal provides also yet another illustration of some of the complexities that now bedevil sentencing and impose what might fairly be regarded as an undue burden on scarce resources. The issue of what sentence is merited by an offender’s criminality judged against the specification of an offence and the penalty prescribed for it becomes almost subsumed in a consideration of, if not minutiae, detail. Lengthy checklists, e.g. s21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, of matters are required to be considered (though not “if it would be contrary to any Act or rule of law to do so”), and any omission to refer to a matter in the checklists that is the subject of some evidence is readily construed as a failure of the sentencing process. Some matters can be taken into account in one way but not another and what are in practice fine distinctions having little to do with criminality e.g. mental illness of intellectual disability on the one hand, youth on the other – see R v Way, at [85-86] - are drawn. Again a mistake (or looseness in expression in a busy sentencing day) commonly leads to sentencing having to be reviewed. Standard non-parole periods, some bearing no sensible relationship with the maximum penalties provided, have to be taken into account. 
     
      
    113 It is unsurprising that in R v McNaughton, at [16], the Chief Justice queried the possibility of the continuation of instinctive synthesis. 
     
      
    114 The orders I propose are:- 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Confirm the sentences of imprisonment for a fixed term of 6 months commencing on 12 May 2008 imposed by Cogswell DCJ on 5 September 2008 in respect of the offences of malicious damage and assault on Mrs Hardy; 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) Allow the appeal in respect of the other sentences imposed by Cogswell DCJ on that day; 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) Quash those other sentences and in lieu thereof sentence the Applicant as follows; 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) On the charge of assault occasioning actual bodily harm, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a fixed term of 18 months commencing on 12 May 2008; 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) On the charge of breaking entering and stealing committed on 4 January 2007, sentence the Applicant to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months commencing on 12 November 2009 and a balance of term of 1 year and 6 months commencing on 12 May 2013;  
        
       
       
        
        (vii) Record as the date upon which it appears to the Court that the Applicant shall first become eligible for parole, 12 May 2013. 
        
       
      
    115 JOHNSON J: I have had the advantage of considering the draft judgments of Basten JA and RS Hulme J in this matter. It is not necessary to repeat in this judgment the recital of facts contained in those judgments. 
     
      
    116 I agree that it is necessary for this Court to resentence the Applicant. 
     
      
    117 I have determined that the appropriate sentences to be passed upon the Applicant are those proposed by Basten JA. I will briefly express my reasons for joining in those orders.  
     
      
    118 This was a far from trivial offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The Applicant turned on Mr Hardy using a screwdriver as a weapon and inflicted injury upon him which, fortunately, was not particularly serious. The Applicant was interrupted in the commission of another criminal act, and turned on Mr Hardy when challenged in that activity. Although the degree of actual bodily harm was not great, the circumstances of the offence itself were comparatively serious.  
     
      
    119 The task of the sentencing Judge on the first count was rendered more difficult by the fact that a break, enter and steal offence was placed on a Form 1, to be taken into account on sentence for the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. Thus, a dishonesty offence with a maximum penalty of 14 years’ imprisonment was to be taken into account when the Applicant was sentenced for an offence of violence carrying a maximum penalty of imprisonment for five years. This was in circumstances where the Applicant had a lengthy history of offences of dishonesty including break, enter and steal offences. Of course, his Honour was bound to take the Form 1 offence into account within the confines of the principles in Attorney General’s Application Under Section 37 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (No. 1 of 2002) (2002) 56 NSWLR 146.  
     
      
    120 This Court has expressed concern with respect to the inappropriate selection of charges to be placed on a Form 1. See, for example, SGJ v R  [2008] NSWCCA 258 at [23]-[29], Eedens v R [2009] NSWCCA 254 at [17]-[19] and C-P v R [2009] NSWCCA 291 at [2]-[9]. Paragraph 20 of the Prosecution Guidelines of the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW), entitled “Charge Negotiation and Agreement: Agreed Statements of Facts: Form 1”, provides that the decision to place offences on a Form 1 should be based on principle and reason, not administrative convenience or expedience alone. The Guidelines state that, generally speaking, the maximum penalty of offences placed on a Form 1 should be less than the maximum penalty available for the principal offence. It is not clear how the letter and spirit of the Prosecution Guidelines were met by the insertion of a break, enter and steal offence on a Form 1 behind the assault occasioning actual bodily harm offence. It might be thought that a more appropriate location for this matter was on a Form 1 behind the break, enter and steal offence for which the Applicant was also to be sentenced.  
     
      
    121 In any event, it was necessary for the sentencing Judge to take into account the break, enter and steal offence on the Form 1 when passing sentence for the offence under s.59 Crimes Act 1900. Making all due allowance for the limited use which could be made of the Form 1 offence having regard to the decision in Attorney General’s Application (No. 1 of 2002), it was necessary for the sentence for the s.59 offence to reflect, in a real way, the serious break, enter and steal offence taken into account on the Form 1. In addition, the Applicant had little operating in his favour at the subjective level, having regard to his criminal history and the fact that the offences were committed whilst he was subject to conditional liberty. In my view, the sentence proposed by Basten JA on the s.59 offence, taking into account the matter on the Form 1, is an appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    122 I agree with Basten JA with respect to the proposed sentence on the second count, the charge of break, enter and steal. The proposed sentence pays due regard to the objective circumstances of the offence and the subjective circumstances of the Applicant. 
     
      
    123 I agree with Basten JA’s approach to accumulation and concurrency of the sentences. The total effective sentence represents a proper period of incarceration for the totality of the criminality involved: R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [70]; R v Knight (2005) 155 A Crim r 252 at 272 [112]. 
     
      
    124 I agree with the orders proposed by Basten JA.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I have had the benefit of reading the judgment of Simpson J in draft.  
     
      
    2 I share her Honour’s view that the sentence was in the present case manifestly excessive. This conclusion is informed by consideration of the guidance provided with respect to this type of offence, inter alia, by the decisions of this Court in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 and R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252. As Simpson J has indicated, in Whyte, this Court confirmed that where an offender’s moral culpability is high, in the case of death a sentence of less than 3 years imprisonment would generally not be appropriate. High moral culpability may be present where an offender is found to have abandoned responsibility for their driving. 
     
      
    3 Both in Jurisic and Whyte this Court recognised that there will be circumstances where the moral culpability of an offender may be of a lower order and may justify only the imposition of a non-custodial sentence. The circumstances where such a sentence may be appropriate will “almost invariably be confined to cases involving momentary inattention or misjudgement.” (Jurisic at 2213E). However, this Court has not said that momentary inattention will necessarily result in a non-custodial sentence. 
     
      
    4 When considering the moral culpability of an offender a finding of momentary inattention is plainly of significance. However, it may not and generally will not be an adequate description of the circumstances relevant to the offence. Momentary inattention when driving at low speed or on an isolated country road may involve culpability of a significantly lower order than momentary inattention when driving on a freeway or in an urban environment where the traffic is dense with intersections controlled by traffic signals.  
     
      
    5 Momentary inattention when travelling at the speed limit, 60 kph towards an intersection controlled by traffic signals can, as happened in the present case, result in the tragic death of others. Although in this case a custodial sentence was required I am satisfied that the term provided by the sentencing judge, having regard to the guidance available from Whyte was excessive. 
     
      
    6 Simpson J discusses the nature of the relationship between a custodial sentence and the manner in which it is to be served. The Criminal Appeal Act provides for an appeal against the sentence imposed on an offender. Sentence under that Act is defined to mean any order by the court of trial “including any sentence of imprisonment the subject of a periodic detention order or home detention order and any sentence of imprisonment whose execution is suspended.” A sentence of imprisonment which is the subject of such an order or which is suspended will be more lenient than one which is required to be served by full time custody. That leniency may be significant: R v Hallacoglu (1992) 63 A Crim R 287 (at 292). When considering whether the sentence which has been passed is appropriate the fact that it has been ordered to be served other than by full time custody is relevant and could be significant. When considering whether another sentence should have been passed (s 6(3)) requires consideration of all of the elements of the sentence including as the Criminal Appeal Act, in my view, contemplates the manner in which the sentence is to be served. 
     
      
    7 I agree with the orders proposed by Simpson J. 
     
      
    8 SIMPSON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of a sentence imposed upon him in the District Court on 3 April 2009 following his plea of guilty to a charge of dangerous driving causing death (Crimes Act 1900, s 52A(1)(c)). Such an offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. Murrell DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for 2½ years, made up of a non-parole period of 22 months and a balance of term of 8 months, and directed that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    9 The offence was committed on 25 September 2006. At about 10.00am on that day the applicant was driving a small sedan motor vehicle south on the Cumberland Highway at Smithfield at a speed of approximately 60 kph (within the prescribed speed limit).  
     
      
    10 At an intersection with Brennan Street, through inattention (conceded by the Crown to have been momentary) he failed to observe an amber traffic light followed by a red light and travelled into the intersection without lessening his speed. His vehicle collided with a vehicle driven by Mr Van Nui Nguyen, who was driving a sedan in Brennan Street, and entered the intersection with a green light in his favour. Mr Nguyen suffered fatal injuries. 
     
      
    11 The applicant himself suffered an injury to his head, and a broken ankle, resulting in hospitalisation for three days, and a degree of amnesia concerning the accident.  
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    12 The applicant was born in March 1955 in Vietnam. He was 51 at the time of the offence, 54 at sentencing. (His plea of guilty was not entered until 9 February 2009, the day fixed for trial, which presumably explains the rather lengthy delay between the offence and sentencing.) 
     
      
    13 The applicant grew up in Vietnam, during the Vietnamese/American war, where he was conscripted into the army at the age of 17. At the conclusion of the war his family sought refuge in Thailand, and then Australia. The applicant migrated to the United States, where he remained for almost 30 years, and took out US citizenship. He married in the US in 1983. Two children were born. In 2000 the marriage failed and he and his children migrated to Australia to rejoin the family of his birth. He has been granted permanent resident status in Australia. 
     
      
    14 In 2006 the applicant was in the process of attempting a reconciliation with his wife, when she died suddenly in the US. A couple of months earlier, a brother, to whom the applicant had been very close, also died. The applicant was plainly distressed by these events. 
     
      
    15 The applicant has no criminal or traffic record. He has held a driver’s licence for many years, and has driven regularly, sometimes for significant periods of time. 
     
      
    16 At the time of the offence, and thereafter, he was employed as a forklift driver and storeman.  
     
      
    17 The applicant has the sole care of his two children, a daughter in her 20s who is a TAFE student, and a 14 year old son. 
     
      
       
      The proceedings 
       
      
    18 As at September 2008, the applicant had entered a plea of not guilty to the charge. On 15 September 2008 a trial commenced before Judge Sides and a jury. Some time after the first day of the trial, and for reasons that do not, for present purposes, matter, the jury was discharged. A further trial date was fixed. On 9 February 2009 the applicant entered a plea of guilty. The matter then came before Judge Murrell. 
     
      
    19 Notwithstanding the plea of guilty, there was a significant factual issue raised on behalf of the applicant, as a result of which expert witnesses were called and gave evidence over two consecutive days. That evidence was directed to an issue raised on behalf of the applicant in an attempt to cast some of the responsibility for the collision upon Mr Nguyen. That attempt failed and Murrell DCJ rejected the proposition that any blame could be attributed to Mr Nguyen. 
     
      
    20 The applicant himself did not give evidence on the sentencing proceedings, either with respect to the circumstances of the collision, nor to his subjective circumstances. Counsel who appeared for him made extensive submissions (including written submissions) and began by telling her Honour that the Crown prosecutor had indicated: 
     
      
       
        
        “… that he does not need, does not require me to call my client and he is content for me to put these matters from the bar table.” 
        
       
      
    21 Also before her Honour was a pre-sentence report, from which some of the subjective matters outlined above were drawn. The author of the report referred to the applicant’s behaviour during the interview when Mr Nguyen was discussed. The author appears to have accepted that the remorse expressed by the applicant was genuine. 
     
      
    22 Importantly, the officer assessed the applicant as eligible for a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention, but nevertheless considered him unsuitable for such an order by reason of: 
     
      
       
        
        “… his work commitments that would prevent him from attending the Correctional Centre as required and his family commitments where he is the sole parent with two dependent children.” 
        
       
       
      The remarks on sentence 
       
      
    23 The sentencing judge recounted the facts and subjective circumstances. As indicated above, she rejected the proposition that Mr Nguyen had contributed to the accident. She accepted, as was conceded by the Crown, that the applicant’s culpable conduct was momentary inattention and that this was due to the recent tragedies of the deaths of his brother and wife. 
     
      
    24 She considered a submission that the applicant ought to be dealt with by way of a suspended sentence, and rejected that as too lenient, having regard to the fact that his conduct had resulted in the loss of a life. She also rejected the assessment of the applicant as unsuitable for a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention, determined that the sentence to be imposed would be served by way of periodic detention, and imposed the sentence I have mentioned above. 
     
      
    25 It will be observed that the sentence is structured (although mathematically imprecisely) broadly in accordance with s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”). 
     
      
    26 Her Honour made no mention of that sub-section, and gave no reasons for not varying the statutory ratio. (This is hardly surprising, as she was at no time invited to do so.) 
     
      
    27 Although she commenced her remarks on sentence with a reference to the fact that the applicant had pleaded guilty, she made no further reference to that circumstance, and did not say whether she had or had not made any allowance in accordance with the decision of this Court in R v Thomson; R v Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383, for the utilitarian value of the plea.  
     
      
    28 It is these two aspects of the remarks on sentence that give rise to two specific grounds of the application for leave to appeal as initially pleaded.  
     
      
       
      Grounds of the application  
       
      
    29 These are pleaded as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) The sentencing judge failed to properly consider, or at all, whether ‘special circumstances’ were made out in relation to the applicant. 
         
         
        (2) The learned sentencing judge failed to assess properly, or at all, whether the applicant’s plea of guilty entitled him to a sentencing discount on a utilitarian basis. 
         
         
        (3) The sentence is manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    30 At the conclusion of the argument of the application, counsel for the applicant sought and was granted leave to amend by adding an additional ground. This he formulated as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(4) The sentencing judge failed to properly consider the appropriate period of imprisonment before turning to a consideration of how that period of imprisonment ought to be served.” 
        
       
       
      Ground 1 (special circumstances) 
       
      
    31 Section 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “(2) The balance of the term of the sentence must not exceed one-third of the non-parole period for the sentence, unless the court decides that there are special circumstances for it being more (in which case the court must make a record of its reasons for that decision).” 
        
       
      
    32 It is to be observed that the sub-section prohibits the imposition of a term of imprisonment in which the period of eligibility for release on parole exceeds one-third of the non-parole period, unless the court finds that special circumstances exist that permit departure from that ratio (in which case the court must give reasons for that decision). That is, the presumption is that the sentence will be structured in accordance with that ratio, unless reasons to the contrary are demonstrated. It is departure from the stated ratio, not adherence to it, that must be justified and explained. I mention this rather obvious and well-known fact because the submissions put on behalf of the applicant tended to invert that position, and argue that, notwithstanding that the issue was not raised at the sentence hearing, and that it was never put to the sentencing judge that a basis existed to vary the s 44(2) ratio, nevertheless she was obliged, of her own accord, to have considered that question as part of the proper discharge of her sentencing function. 
     
      
    33 It was further argued that, had she done so, she could, on the material available, have reached a satisfaction that the necessary special circumstances existed. The relevant circumstances were identified as: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) it had been established that the applicant had no record of any kind and was of prior good character, 
         
         
        (b) the Crown had conceded remorse for the purposes of s 21A(3) of the [ 
        Sentencing Procedure Act 
        ],  
         
         
        (c) the sentencing judge had found the applicant was unlikely to re-offend, and  
         
         
        (d) the imprisonment (however to be served) would represent his first ever sentence.”  
        
       
      
    34 It may be doubted that (b) and (c) have any significant bearing on the question. The need for assistance or supervision in readjusting to non-prison life, and to maintaining a crime-free existence is often cited as a circumstance justifying departure from the statutory ratio. Where rehabilitation is complete (or, as here, the offence is such that rehabilitation is of dubious relevance), no basis exists for extending the parole period. Indeed, those circumstances might point towards the imposition of a fixed term of imprisonment: see s 45 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. I accept, however, that (a) and (d) are capable of having a bearing on the question; to these I would add the applicant’s obligations and responsibility for the care of his children. 
     
      
    35 But the real question is whether, having regard to the manner in which the sub-section is structured, it is obligatory upon a sentencing judge, in the absence of submissions, explicitly to consider a course of action that, if followed, would result in a sentence more favourable to an offender than would otherwise be the case. In my opinion, it was not. The various participants in litigation, including sentencing litigation, have their own roles and responsibilities. It is the responsibility of counsel to raise, on behalf of their clients, such matters as may be relevant to the ultimate determination of the proceedings. It is no less so in sentencing proceedings. It is particularly the role and responsibility of counsel for an offender to produce evidence and direct argument in support of issues that may properly be used to mitigate the sentence to be imposed. It is not the role and responsibility of a judge to take on the role of counsel and anticipate what might, had proper attention been given to the question, have been put. It is quite unfair to criticise a judge who determines sentence on the basis of the issues addressed by counsel for not going beyond those issues. Indeed, it may well be that counsel who appeared for the applicant made a considered decision not to seek variation, based on his appreciation of the relevant evidentiary material. 
     
      
    36 I am prepared to accept that, had the question of special circumstances been raised, it would have been open to her Honour to make a finding favourable to the applicant and that she may have done so. What I am not prepared to accept is that, in the absence of the issue being raised by counsel for the applicant, it was an error for her Honour not to take it upon herself to direct attention to it. I would, accordingly, reject this ground of the application. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 (the plea of guilty) 
       
      
    37 Once again, no mention was made on behalf of the applicant of the question of a reduction in sentence by reason of his plea of guilty.  
     
      
    38 It is well established that such a reduction is allowed for the utilitarian value of the plea (see Thomson and Houlton). A significant factor in the assessment of a reduction is the time at which the plea is entered. 
     
      
    39 Here, as was acknowledged on behalf of the applicant, the utilitarian value was “diluted” by reason of its very late timing, and of the contested facts which involved the court in hearing from witnesses. It is not to be overlooked that a trial had in fact commenced, and proceeded for a day before (for reasons not attributable to the applicant) being aborted. 
     
      
    40 It was, nevertheless, contended that a discount in the range of 5-10 per cent was properly available.  
     
      
    41 I rather doubt that that is so.  
     
      
    42 The Court has been provided with the transcript of the first day of the trial which commenced before Sides DCJ. At the end of that day (a Monday) his Honour told the jury that the trial was anticipated to be shorter than previously thought, and would possibly be completed in that week.  
     
      
    43 As I mentioned above, when the matter came back before Murrell DCJ, evidence was given on two consecutive days; argument took place on a third. The utilitarian value of the plea was very limited indeed.  
     
      
    44 As with the question of special circumstances, I accept that, had the matter been raised before her Honour, it is something to which she could and would have given consideration, and may have made some reduction. 
     
      
    45 However, it was not an error for her not to do so in these unusual circumstances. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 (manifestly excessive) 
       
      
    46 The submissions made on behalf of the applicant in support of this ground were that, in the light of powerful findings in favour of the applicant with respect to subjective circumstances, and the relatively low level of culpability, the sentence imposed was manifestly excessive. However, these submissions are of rather less force when it is recognised that they were put on the mistaken basis that the total sentence was of 3 years, rather than the 2 years and 6 months actually imposed.  
     
      
    47 Reference was made to a previous decision of this Court in R v Tomson [1999] NSWCCA 369 in which, in not significantly dissimilar circumstances, a recognisance in the sum of $1000 together with supervision by the Probation and Parole Service for six months was imposed. A Crown appeal failed, with this Court describing the sentence as “extremely lenient”. Indeed, the decision was a majority decision; Smart AJ considered that the sentence imposed failed to reflect the objective gravity of the offence, which his Honour regarded as “exceedingly serious”. Tomson does not assist the determination whether this sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    48 There are, however, other considerations. In considering whether a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention is manifestly excessive (or, indeed, manifestly inadequate) it is easy to be misled into placing undue focus upon the manner in which the sentence is to be served. That is because, as is well recognised, a sentence to be so served carries a significant degree of leniency (R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67). But to focus upon the mode of service of the sentence is to deflect attention from the real question, which is whether the sentence specified is manifestly excessive (or manifestly inadequate). It is the sentence against which leave to appeal is sought, and may be granted. 
     
      
    49 Section 6(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A court that has sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than 3 years may make a periodic detention order directing that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention.” 
        
       
      
    50 It is perfectly clear that a sentencing court must, before considering s 6, determine and impose the sentence. So much was confirmed by this Court in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [26]. It would be wrong for a sentencing judge to extend the terms of the sentence by reason of the fact that it is to be served by way of periodic detention. That follows purely from the proper construction of s 6 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. It is also established by decisions of this Court: see, for example R v Wegener [1999] NSWCCA 405 at [23]; Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; (2005) 159 A Crim R 154; Reed v R [2007] NSWCCA 4 at [25]. 
     
      
    51 There are other, good, reasons for that being so. For example, an offender who fails to comply with the terms of the periodic detention order may be taken into custody and serve the remainder of the sentence in full-time custody. It would be unfair for such an offender to serve longer than he or she otherwise would because the sentence was initially to be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    52 It would, in my opinion, equally be wrong for this Court to approach its task of determining the manifest excessiveness or inadequacy of the sentence on the basis that it was to be served by way of periodic detention. The task of this Court is to determine if error, explicit or implicit, patent or latent, infected the sentencing process. It must, in this case, therefore, determine whether a sentence of 2½ years was, in the circumstances, manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    53 This is not to say that an order that a sentence be served by way of periodic detention is unreviewable by this Court. There may be cases where the leniency recognised as inherent in a periodic detention order transforms an otherwise adequate sentence into one that is manifestly inadequate. But that is by review of the periodic detention order, not review of the sentence itself. 
     
      
    54 Where the appeal is against severity, the focus of this Court is upon the sentence specified before the order that it be served by way of periodic detention is made. 
     
      
    55 I accept that this Court may not always have recognised the need to differentiate between the term of the sentence and the manner in which it is to be served; see, for example R v Pangallo (1991) 56 A Crim R 441 at 444; R v Overall (1993) 71 A Crim R 170 at 175; R v Roberts, Lewis and McVean (1994) 73 A Crim R 306 at 313. But, at least since 1999 (Wegener), the sequence necessary for sentencing judges has been clear. It is only logical that this Court (as a Court the jurisdiction of which is to identify error) must take a parallel approach.  
     
      
    56 In R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; 55 NSWLR 252, this Court re-formulated the guideline judgment earlier promulgated in R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209. It held that, in cases of dangerous driving causing death, a full-time custodial sentence of less than three years would generally not be appropriate (at [229]). But following Jurisic, this was directed to cases in which the level of culpability was high, or the offender had, in effect, abandoned responsibility. Relevant factors are listed at [216], and include speed, nature of the driving, intoxication by alcohol or other drugs. 
     
      
    57 The present was not a case to which either Jurisic or Whyte applies. In Jurisic, indeed, the Court implicitly recognised the possibility of a non-custodial sentence in cases of “momentary inattention or misjudgment” (see [206]). 
     
      
    58 In Whyte, the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “230 In the case of a low level of moral culpability, a lower sentence will, of course, be appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    59 Here, the sentence of 2½ years imposed was only 6 months below that specified for cases of high moral culpability and/or abandonment of responsibility. Care must be taken not to allow the assessment of that sentence to be clouded by focus upon the mode by which it is to be served. When the element of periodic detention is removed from consideration (as, in my opinion, for reasons I have given, it must be), it becomes plain (to my mind beyond argument) that the sentence here imposed was manifestly excessive. The applicant’s criminality was far below that envisaged in Whyte and Jurisic.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4  
       
      
    60 At the conclusion of her sentencing remarks, the sentencing judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender’s counsel submitted that a suspended sentence under s 12 of the [ 
        Sentencing Procedure 
        ] 
         Act 
         was warranted. In my view, such a sentence would be too lenient. Whatever the merits of the offender’s case, it must not be forgotten that his conduct has resulted in a loss of a life. I have considered the statements, the contents of the pre-sentence report. Although the offender has been assessed as unsuitable for periodic detention, I consider that such an order should be imposed. I do not accept that his work and family commitments render him unsuitable. As far as his teenage son is concerned, the offender’s adult daughter and other relatives are able to assist. Work commitment is no reason to exclude the sentencing option of periodic detention. Subject to the offender signing an appropriate undertaking, I am satisfied of the requirements of s 66 of the [ 
        Sentencing Procedure 
        ] 
         Act 
        . My intention is to impose a periodic detention order with a non-parole period of twenty-two months and a balance of term of eight months. At total term of thirty months.” 
        
       
      
    61 The issues raised by this supplementary ground of appeal overlap significantly with those of Ground 3 and I do not propose to re-state that which I have already stated. I accept, as was put on behalf of the applicant and was conceded by the Crown, that this passage unambiguously discloses error in the approach to sentencing. Together with the relativity between the sentence imposed and the sentences promulgated in Jurisic and Whyte, it is clear that that error in approach has led to an error of substance in the selection of the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    62 Accordingly, in my opinion, the sentence must be quashed and the applicant re-sentenced. 
     
      
    63 It was accepted that the applicant has been conscientiously serving his periodic detention since April of this year. That is a period of 8 months.  
     
      
    64 By reference to the 3 years proposed in Jurisic and Whyte for offences of the kind there described, I am of the view that the appropriate term of the sentence to be imposed upon the applicant is 15 months’ imprisonment to commence on 18 April 2009 and expire on 17 July 2010. Pursuant to s 45 of the Sentencing Procedure Act I would decline to set a non-parole period. I consider that course appropriate because of the nature of the offence, the antecedent character of the applicant and the fact, that cannot be ignored, of the punishment the applicant has already undergone. Pursuant to s 6 of the Sentencing Procedure Act I would make a further order that the whole of the sentence be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    65 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal granted; 
       
       
      (ii) Appeal allowed; 
       
       
      (iii) In lieu of the sentence imposed in the District Court, the applicant be sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 15 months commencing on 18 April 2009 and expiring on 17 July 2010, to be served by way of periodic detention. 
       
      
    66 HIDDEN J: I agree with the orders proposed by Simpson J and, generally, with her Honour’s reasons. The question to what extent this Court should have regard to the fact that a sentence is to be served by way of periodic detention in determining whether that sentence is manifestly excessive is one which need not be decided in the present case, and I prefer to express no concluded view about it.

   JUDGMENT1. Eden O’Grady is a young man who comes from a troubled background who has done remarkable things to develop his life and opportunities. He has shown, as Mr Hogan who appears for him says, a remarkable degree of determination and perseverance from a young age. However, on 12 December 2008 he did a very silly thing. Not only was it silly, it was a serious criminal act and resulted in him being charged with a very serious offence.2. I am now to sentence him for that offence and I need to weigh up, on the one hand, the need to punish offenders who have committed very serious offences with appropriately severe punishment with, on the other hand, taking into account a young man’s personal circumstances in a case such as this. 3. What happened can be briefly summarised from what is agreed between the parties and recorded in exhibit A. Mr O’Grady is from Melbourne. He was visiting Sydney in December 2008 as a member of a band which was playing at a club. After the band finished playing Mr O’Grady and some friends ended up talking with some other young men. Words were exchanged between Mr O’Grady and a young man named Alexander Somers. They started pushing and punching each other and were pulled apart by Mr O’Grady’s companion. Mr Somers sat in the gutter about five metres away, this was in the street, around Oxford and Flinders Streets in Darlinghurst.4. What happened next was that Mr O’Grady approached Mr Somers from behind holding out his hand to assist him. The gesture appeared to be one of reconciliation. He said “Hey man”, as if he was about to apologise, but as he got closer to Mr Somers instead of apologising he swung a wine bottle which he was holding behind his back in an arc and hit Mr Somers on the top of his head. Mr Somers stumbled on to the road and into a bus lane. He held himself against a car. The bottle was not broken by the blow, it fell onto the road and broke. After that everything went black according to his description.5. Mr O’Grady and his companion ran away. Mr Somers and his companion chased them. A further scuffle broke out. Mr Somers phoned the police. Mr O’Grady was arrested and interviewed by the police to whom he admitted the details of the offence. Mr Somers was taken to the hospital, his wound was serious enough to have administered eight stitches to his head. He experienced pain to his head, face, his cheek and his right shoulder and his neck. A CT scan was recommended but he discharged himself from hospital.6. As a result of what I have described Mr O’Grady was charged with the very serious offence of wounding with intent to do grievous bodily harm against s 33(1)(a) of the Crimes Act 1900. He pleaded guilty to an alternative of recklessly wounding under s 35(4) of the same Act. That offence, of which I now convict him, carries a maximum of seven years imprisonment. It is an offence regarded so seriously by the New South Wales Parliament that it has fixed a standard non-parole period of three years imprisonment to that crime. 7. It is important in any case including this one to have a clear understanding of the seriousness of a crime which is why I have set out the details of what happened first. It is also important that an offender’s personal circumstances are taken into account by a sentencing judge. 8. In this case Mr O’Grady has no prior convictions. Because he lives in Victoria a report has been obtained from the Community Correctional Services Branch of the Department of Justice in Victoria. That report gave very helpful information about Mr O’Grady’s personal history. 9. Mr O’Grady has recently turned twenty-one years of age. He was brought up in Queensland but moved to Victoria where he undertook a certificate in liberal arts and then gained entry to Swinburne University where he is undertaking a Bachelor of Arts in Media and Communication. His general health is good. He had a difficult upbringing which I have referred to and which I will discuss in more detail in turning to the psychologist’s report. He was assessed as having a moderate risk of re-offending. The author of the report assessed him as an intelligent young man with a bright future ahead of him. He expressed empathy for the victim of the assault and did not try to minimise the offence or its consequences. It recommended a community based order rather than imprisonment and suggested certain conditions which could be administered by the Victorian authority. 10. In 2008 Mr O’Grady was himself assaulted in an armed robbery and attended for counselling with a psychologist in Fitzroy in Victoria. That psychologist treated him for the impact which the assault had on Mr O’Grady and then saw him again when he was charged with this offence. It noted that Mr O’Grady has been working as a musician as well as a barman and had no prior relevant psychiatric history but the psychologist noted some depression and anxiety as a teenager. This was said to result from an environment of domestic abuse when he was growing up. He was apparently regularly physically assaulted by his mother during his adolescence as well as it happens by a taxi driver more recently. 11. His parents separated soon after he was born and he spent most of his childhood with his mother who is said to suffer from a borderline personality disorder and said to be cannabis dependent. In fact his teenage years were so difficult that he left home aged fifteen and completed to the extent that he could his secondary education independently.12. The psychologist who prepared the report, Mr Greco, diagnosed him when he attended in 2008 as suffering from an exacerbation to his pre-existing generalised anxiety disorder together with features of traumatic stress resulting from the assault in 2008. Mr Greco undertook regular treatment for that condition. 13. Mr Greco thought that the offence which Mr O’Grady is charged with is connected with behaviour “imbedded in his trauma history together with a significant amount of alcohol consumed” on that particular occasion. Indeed he expressed the opinion that Mr O’Grady was not in full control of his behaviour at the time the incident occurred. Mr Greco acknowledged Mr O’Grady’s very difficult upbringing and recorded that to his credit he has “maintained focus on his career and education and has largely been able to stay out of trouble against the odds.” He has been regularly treated by Mr Greco who expressed the opinion that “support and further counselling is the best way to encourage” Mr O’Grady for the future. 14. Mr O’Grady’s personal history is confirmed in a reference from Megan Knight who had a long-term relationship with Mr O’Grady’s uncle and was part of his family. She made observations about the relationship between Mr O’Grady and his mother. I also have references from his grandfather, Mr Brian O’Grady, and from a man named Rohan Buck who clearly has a very high opinion of Mr O’Grady whom he knows very well. Indeed he made some observations about Mr O’Grady’s behaviour when working as a barman which indicate exemplary moral character. 15. Mr Hogan called his client to give evidence. Mr O’Grady confirmed what was contained in the various reports. He expressed genuine remorse, in my opinion, about what had happened. This was quite genuine because of his own experience in being assaulted. He said that, if he could, he would wish to personally acknowledge with Mr Somers his regret for what had happened. He is still undertaking his degree. Hardly a day goes past without him recollecting what he had done and regretting it. It is the most serious thing that he has done in his life. 16. Mr Hogan submitted that the offence lay within the lower end of the range of objective seriousness pointing to the injury being not substantial and the victim not requiring to stay in hospital. He argued that it was opportunistic and there may have been some provocation involved because of the previous scuffle. He also pointed to the psychologist’s observation about Mr O’Grady’s own personal trauma history contributing in some way towards the behaviour. 17. Mr Singh, who appeared as prosecutor, on the other hand emphasised the seriousness of this public violence. He reminded me of the attitude which the Court of Criminal Appeal has taken towards what are called glassing cases and of the importance of general deterrence in sentencing in serious offences such as this. 18. In response Mr Hogan argued that although the offence in this case involved the use of a glass bottle it was not broken and not used in a way as a form of weapon as happens in many of these cases where it is smashed and forced into the victim’s face. 19. To my mind the offence is a serious example of public street violence involving a weapon and involving a wound which required a young man to attend hospital. Although it was spontaneous and followed a scuffle, nevertheless it was a serious incident of street violence.20. I think the offence falls within at least the upper end of the bottom end of the range of objective seriousness. Indeed I think it more likely that, which I find, it falls within the lower end of the middle of the range of objective seriousness and I so find. As I said earlier this offence carries a standard non-parole period of three years. Strictly speaking that non-parole period does not apply because this involves a plea of guilty but nevertheless it is important to bear it in mind as a guidepost as Mr Singh reminded me. 21. Mr Hogan ..(80 seconds break in recording).. I do not regard that as an appropriate penalty in this case because of the seriousness of the offence which occurred. Mr Hogan’s secondary position was that a bond under s 9 of the same Act might be appropriate. 22. Mr Singh on the other hand argued that this is a case which can only be dealt with by way of a custodial sentence, indeed a full-time custodial sentence would be appropriate. He said that based upon the seriousness of the offending behaviour as well as on how serious Parliament regards the offence by fixing a standard non-parole period to it. 23. I think Mr Singh is right in his submissions. I think this is a sort of crime that because of its public nature and the serious personal violence that was involved can only be dealt with by way of a custodial sentence. If this matter fell within the middle of the range of objective seriousness and Mr O’Grady was convicted after a trial, I would regard an appropriate sentence as one of four years with the standard non-parole period of three years.24. However, the matter falls towards the lower end of the middle of the range of objective seriousness and I would regard an appropriate sentence as one of just over two and a half years with a non-parole period of about two years.25. However, Mr O’Grady has pleaded guilty and I propose to allow a discount of twenty per cent because he has pleaded guilty. I do not allow twenty-five per cent because the plea was relatively recent, although it did follow some negotiations between the parties. I would regard an appropriate sentence as in the region of about twenty-five months. Because of Mr O’Grady’s clear remorse, I would reduce that sentence to one of twenty-four months. 26. I turn my attention to the question of how that penalty should be served. This is such a serious offence that there is some force in Mr Singh’s submission that it should be served by way of full-time custody. A Periodic Detention Order I cannot impose because I do not have a report indicating that it is available. That is because Mr O’Grady lives in Victoria and the report understandably did not deal with that sentencing option.27. He has made very good progress with his psychologist. He is a young man, as I said, who has shown much determination and perseverance in overcoming significant factors in his personal history. He has got himself to university and is part-way through a degree and has an idea of what kind of general direction he might take. The psychologist is confident that he can assist him as he has in the past. He has family support. Although he has a moderate risk of re-offending, I regard it as appropriate in this case given his age and prospects of rehabilitation which are assisted by his clear remorse and attitude to the offence that an order suspending that sentence is appropriate. 28. For the offence of recklessly wounding Alexander Somers I impose a sentence of imprisonment of two years and I make an order under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 suspending execution of the whole of the sentence for the whole of the two years. I direct that you be released from custody on condition that you enter into a good behaviour bond for two years. 29. That good behaviour bond is subject to the following conditions: (1) that you be of good behaviour; (2) that you notify the registrar of this court of any change of your residential address; (3) that you attend court if called upon to do so and (4) that you accept supervision on an informal basis from the Community Correctional Services Branch of Corrections Victoria in the Department of Justice, including that you are to attend for assessment and treatment for drug and alcohol addiction; you submit to medical, psychological or psychiatric assessment and treatment as directed by the regional manager and (5) that you report to the Carlton Community Correctional Service, 444 Swanston Street, Carlton by 4pm on Wednesday 27 January 2010.HIS HONOUR I will explain all that to you in a moment. Now, any other conditions? I have taken those conditions from the report and in the terms which they have asked for. Any other conditions I should impose, Mr Hogan?HOGAN: No, your Honour. HIS HONOUR: Mr Singh?SINGH: No.30. All right. Mr O’Grady, because of the seriousness of this offence I have sentenced you to imprisonment for two years, it is a serious offence, you have heard me explain it. But because of the reasons that I gave, particularly your age, your background, you have obviously made an effort with your life and you are heading in the right direction, I have suspended the sentence. It is suspended for the whole two years. 31. A few conditions, some formal ones. If you change your address from wherever you are now you have to write to the registrar of this court and tell them. If you get a notice saying you have to come back to court, you have to come back. A third one which is very important is you have to behave yourself, no more trouble. Nothing even minor like possessing cannabis or stuff like that. I will explain why in a moment. The fourth and fifth conditions are the supervision. I have taken it from the report which they have given. You are to accept supervision informally because I cannot order it - they do it informally because they are not in New South Wales, from these people in Victoria that I named. You have to go and be assessed for treatment for drug and alcohol and including medical psychological, psychiatric assessment and treatment as they direct. And you have to turn up to that address which will be in the report which Mr Hogan has. And they say you have to report within two working days of the order. So that is why I have said you have to turn up. Are you going back to Victoria over the weekend? You have to turn up - remember Tuesday is a holiday. So it’s either Monday or Wednesday but definitely by Wednesday at 4 o’clock. Is that where you went for you interview?OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour, it was.HIS HONOUR: 444 Swanston Street, Carlton. And they will assess you and supervise you. 32. What is really important in these sorts of cases, which I have to explain, is a suspended sentence and the bond that goes with it means that if you breach the suspended sentence, it is not like an ordinary bond. An ordinary bond you come back to court and the judge says “Look, I understand what happened, okay. We will put you back on the bond.” A suspended sentence means that when you come back, if you breach it, the judge has very little choice but to send you to gaol and it may well be full-time gaol here because we cannot give you periodic detention or may not be able to, I am not too sure. The law in New South Wales means that if you have a suspended sentence with a bond and you breach it, the odds are in favour of you going to gaol. It is very hard for the judge to avoid it. It says you have to go to gaol unless and it is very difficult to avoid. So it is a tough sentence. Mr Hogan will explain it to you. So you have to stay out of trouble for those two years or you will be back before me and I will not be able to be as sympathetic or as lenient. My hands will be tied. You might end up in goal which is what you do not want.33. You have done very well in getting your life together. For a young man, your age, that is very impressive. I know a number of people have probably told you that. It is good work, keep it up. Get help from the corrections people, they are experienced, they know what they are doing. Mr Greco, you get on well with him?OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.Good, stick with him as well. All these people will help you and help you get your life together which you are obviously already doing and carry on that way. So good luck.Is there anything else, Mr Hogan?HOGAN: As a matter of form, should your Honour either fix a non-parole period or record your reasons for not--HIS HONOUR: Your instructing solicitor is shaking his head and I think he is right.HOGAN: I understand - because I discussed it with him, that with suspended sentences--HIS HONOUR: I think you fix it if it is breached.HOGAN: --you do not. But I’m aware of some authority with standard non-parole period offences that the Court of Criminal Appeal has indicated a non-parole period should be fixed. But perhaps because it is for suspended sentence, that’s overridden by that. If your Honour is--HIS HONOUR: I think so.HOGAN: --content that you should not and need not, then I’ll defer to your Honour’s wisdom.HIS HONOUR: You have reminded me of something else, do I have to give reasons for--HOGAN: That’s what I wondered, whether your Honour needed to indicate the particular part of the Sentencing Procedure Act that I was looking at--HIS HONOUR: Section 50--HOGAN: --was 45 whereby if you don’t set a non-parole period, you ought to indicate the reason that you weren't doing so.HIS HONOUR: I’m not sure that applies, I think what might apply is s 54C. But I’m not sure whether this counts as a non-custodial sentence.HOGAN: I think it does, your Honour. And in the sentence that I have it’s specified at paragraph - well, under 5S, 54C(10).HIS HONOUR: I see what you mean.HOGAN: I raise it as a question to which I don't know the answer and I just thought your Honour needed to consider them, the obligation to accord reasons for not setting a non-parole period. You’ve certainly record your reasons for not setting the standard non-parole period but the issue of not setting a non-parole period at all is what I was addressing. HIS HONOUR: I think that’s - what do you say, Mr Singh? We could always come back for sentence revision.SINGH: Yes, your Honour. I think these days when you breach a suspended sentence that only when you come back, the only thing that’s done is a non-parole period is set. So I mean, applying common sense, I can't give you a great legal answer yet, it means that it’s open for you to not set suspended sentence because that’s what’s required if there’s a breach, your Honour, to fix that situation. Yes, you do have to give reason which you have given reason why you didn't apply the standard non-parole period.34. And I think I’ve complied with s 54C in identifying the mitigating factors which I took into account, specifically his personal background and particularly his age, for the record are the factors which I took into account under s 54C. I doubt whether s 45 applies if you’re suspending the sentence because you don’t fix a non-parole period. If I’m wrong, then we’d better bring it back under s 43, but I don't think I am. I’ve said that before. HOGAN: No.HIS HONOUR: Your client probably needs to go and fill in forms and things like that.HOGAN: Yes, my solicitor has made sure that the registry anticipated that they would still be going to avoid the possibility that we might not be able to enter the bond today. So we’d better get going.HIS HONOUR: All right. Thank you both for your assistance, I’ve appreciated that. It hasn't been straightforward, but we’ve finished it now. And I’m grateful to both of you for your submissions. It’s now approaching 25 past 5. The court officer is here without complaint, the sheriff’s officer and my associate; somebody is monitoring us. There will be court staff, all of whom performing their duties on this Friday afternoon without any complaint. And I personally appreciate that. I had to attend a funeral this morning which meant that I wasn’t able to sit this morning and their inconvenience has met my convenience so I am grateful. ADJOURNED

     JUDGMENT 
      
     Portions of these remarks on sentence have been excluded from this report of them for public policy reasons. 
       
      
    1. CV is another example of the ineffectiveness of a punitive deterrence focussed paradigm of sentencing whom dealing with drug addicts for drug offences. In 1998 he was first before the District Court for supply cocaine, amphetamine and ecstasy. Periodic detention was imposed. In 2002 he was sentenced to prison for two years for importing prohibited goods, there were two charges. In 2006 he was again before the courts for possessing prohibited drugs. In September of 2006 he was before the District Court for supplying prohibited drugs. On this occasion he was sentenced to a non-parole period of six months and a balance of term of eighteen months. He was released from full time custody to serve the balance of his sentence in the community on 18 March 2008. That was his third term of imprisonment and the second full time incarceration.2. The case law is replete with appeal decisions establishing that punishment and deterrence, both general and personal, are among the prime, if not the prime purposes of sentencing. I, of course, am bound by those principles but research and also the number of Parole Board revocations demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the punitive/deterrence based paradigm as a means of reforming offenders and more importantly of protecting the community. 3. Half way through CV’s parole period, police had sufficient evidence of police concerns to satisfy a senior judicial officer to grant a warrant to intercept calls made from his mobile phone for an eighty-eight day period. As the calls proceeded, one after the other it became clear the police concerns were well founded. A large number of calls between CV and his associates established he had agreed to supply and, I am satisfied, did in fact supply prohibited drugs to a number of associates. One hundred of those calls have been transcribed and relied upon by the Crown. 4. Today CV is to be held accountable for his drug dealing between 22 December 2008 and 16 January 2009. The criminality of that offending conduct has been encapsulated in three charges. Firstly, supply 13.8 grams of methamphetamine on 16 January 2009, said to be a deemed supply charge. Secondly, supply 156.3 grams of methylamphetamine on 16 January 2009, a second deemed supply charge. Thirdly, supply a quantity of methamphetamine greater than the commercial quantity between 22 December 2008 and 16 January 2009. Form 1 offences: deal with the proceeds of crime, a second count of dealing with the proceeds of the crime, possess prohibited weapon (knuckle duster), possess prohibited drug (cocaine 2.0 grams), possess prohibited drug (heroin 0.2 grams), possess prescribed restricted substance (2 tabs of Alpaprazolam), possess prohibited drug (2.0 grams cannabis).5. As sentencing Judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for these offences before this court, committed by this offender, harming this community, seeGladue v The Queen [1999] 1SCR 688 [80]. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to him, that is the subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires the sentencing Judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the Court relating to both the offence and the offender. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly.6. Before any sentence can be made there are technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, Form 1 matters and how to deal with them, whether any of these offences, as indeed one does, attracts a standard non-parole period and the length of the relevant parole periods and finally of course the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment. All of these matters have to be discussed and none can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. At the end of the day the real overview of sentencing is that it should have as its primary focus the protection of the community. How this sentence can assist in the protection of the community will need to be determined, see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.Facts- The First Indicted Charge7. On 16 January 2009 police overheard three conversations between one Peter Booth in Camperdown and CV. Police formed the view that Booth was meeting or seeking a meeting with CV in order to purchase drugs. In an unmarked car, police went to Church Street near the intersection of Parramatta Road, Camperdown. They knew Booth and saw him pacing on Church Street continually looking at his mobile phone, on occasion talking on his mobile phone for a short period. Eventually a vehicle driven by CV arrived. Booth got into the vehicle. Police watched as CV drove the vehicle around the block, as best I can tell. They formed a view that drug activity was taking place and stopped it on Marsden Road.8. Police approached passenger and driver’s side doors, identified themselves; Booth and CV were removed. Police told CV and Booth they believed a drug related transaction had occurred and that they would be searching for drugs. CV said, “There are no drugs in there. We were just looking for a place to have a drink”. When searched two mobile phones were located on Booth. While police searched Booth and CV, Booth’s phones were ringing continually. CV attempted to remove a SIM from his car just before being searched. Both males were then strip searched in the rear of the caged police vehicle. The motor vehicle, driven by CV was searched. $1200 in cash contained in a white envelope was in the centre console. It had the name CV written on it. CV denied any knowledge of that money. Looking at the envelope he said, “That looks like my girlfriend’s writing.” That is one of the Form 1 offences.9. Police checked under the vehicle for further items. They saw a small plastic bag underneath the vehicle directly under the driver’s side door. It contained half an ounce of crystalline substance. The bag was seized and labelled. Both men were cautioned and at that point placed under arrest. When questioned at the scene CV said, “It must have been there already, I’ve never seen it before.” Subsequent analysis of the contents of that bag revealed it to contain 13.8 grams of crystalline methamphetamine.10. Two months later on 12 March 2009 CV provided another version of events in relation to the supply of methamphetamine to Booth. CV said he had received a call from Booth on 16 January asking if he, CV, could sell Booth a half an ounce of ice amphetamine. He said that at about 7pm he weighed out half an ounce and put it in a small resealable bag, called Booth from his phone and they arranged to meet on the corner near the kebab shop. He went down to his vehicle - I should note that the vehicle was a Thrifty hire car - drove out the security gates and went to where he picked up Booth. It was CV’s account that he had handed the drugs over to Booth and asked whether three and a half thousand dollars in payment had come in for the drugs. CV’s account is that Booth pulled money from his sock and said he only had $2700 with him and would pay CV the outstanding $800. CV’s reply was, “You’ve put me in a bad position. I owe money. Make sure you give it to me tonight.” CV was told that he would be paid the outstanding money that evening.11. It is CV’s account that he saw Booth place the bag containing the drugs on the centre console armrest. CV looked in the rear vision mirror and saw the police. At that point the drugs were still on the centre console. Booth was holding the money. CV said to Booth, “Grab the shit.” Booth grabbed the bag of drugs. CV did not see what Booth did with the drugs or money as the arrest took place. That, as I say, constitutes the Crown case on the first charge in the indictment. 12. Those facts have been agreed between the parties. Notwithstanding my concern that the facts so put would appear to be somewhat favourable to the offender, given the Crown does not seek to challenge the circumstances relating to the attempted disposal of the amphetamine at the time of arrest I shall not intrude into the agreed facts as a factual basis for sentencing.The Second Indicted Charge13. Following the arrest the police obtained a warrant to search CV’s residential premises. There they found 156.3 grams of crystalline methamphetamine. The basis for the supply are the deeming provisions found in the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, that is an offender is deemed to have the drugs in his possession for the purposes of supply. If I understand the evidence correctly it was contained in three plastic bags, one of 28 grams, one of 14 grams and a balance of about 115 grams in a third bag. Twenty-four and 14 gram lots are a well recognised unit of sale of drugs, the former being an ounce and the latter a half ounce respectively. The remainder of 115 grams constitutes about five and a half ounces approximately. Form 1 Matter14. During the search further items of interest were found so far as is relevant to the Form 1 offences. The following items were found,· $1495 in various denominations.· Small resealable bags each containing approximately 0.2 grams of white powder believed to be cocaine.· One set of black knuckle dusters.· One small resealable bag containing vegetable matter believed to be cannabis. 
    Third Charge15. The parties agree that between 22 December and 16 January 2009 the accused in some nine transactions supplied a quantity of methamphetamine greater than the commercial quantity. A divergence occurs as to the actual quantity of methyl amphetamine supplied. The defence argue that the Crown cannot prove beyond reasonable doubt the 644 grams it alleges. Sometimes the administration of criminal law recognises that what the evidence proves does not reflect the reality of what occurred, but where punishment, particularly incarceration, follows from what the evidence proves the highest standard of proof known to the law should apply. I have already made reference to the methamphetamine found during the execution of the search warrant, in particular one bag of 28 grams and another of 14 grams. I have noted those are well recognised units of sale. 16. Determining the quantity of drugs sold on the evidence before the Court requires interpretation of coded or obscured phone conversation. The Court also has the advantage of the expert evidence of Detective Adam Pierce who has had more than twenty years operational experience and more than twelve years in drug investigation work. Both parties have recognised his expertise. For my part I have had sufficient experience to know that frequently when buyers want a half ounce they say I want a half, nonetheless I have been guided by the evidence in this case. The first of the supplies is to Harken on 23 December 2008. He spoke of having $9,000. Sergeant Pierce’s evidence establishes the price for methamphetamine ranges between $6,000 and $10,000. There is no issue that the drug supplied was methamphetamine in all of these deals. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the quantity supplied on this occasion was an ounce. See also Sergeant Pierce’s evidence, para 24 in relation the to supply there were six phone conversations. My memory is from the other material that I read that there is a statement standing in the accused’s name to the effect that that was an ounce, I may stand corrected on that.17. The second supply is also to Ozer(?)Harken the following day. The relevant conversation is that Harken says “I want you to bring them two” and reaffirms “I’ll have another two but one hour” and in the second call “I got ten grand I...I want to give you...but I need another two.” In the opinion of Sergeant Pierce this conversation is about the purchase of two ounces for $10,000 or $10,000 each (para 30 Sergeant Pierce’s statement). It is, however, unclear which. On my reading of the phone taps Harken only has $10,000. He had paid $9,000 the day before for one ounce. While I accept prices may fluctuate seriously and even quickly, I doubt that the price would fall to four and a half thousand per ounce without some adverse comment about the quality of the drug. The two packets coupled with the ten thousand may be a reference to two 14 gram packets. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the quantity supplied was at least 28 grams.18. The third deal is on 24 December, Christmas Eve, at about 2.48. A man named Brett telephones. When asked what he was after Brett replies two. The offender, it is likely, continues on with the question “What are you after? The same?” The reply, “Two big, no two.” Again no price is mentioned. The word “no” in what Brett says I have interpreted as meaning not the same as last time. It is likely he wanted two big, ie, two ounces but that likelihood depends upon what the word “no” relates to. In all of the circumstances I accept there is a reasonable possibility the “no” is a correction to the adjective “big”. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt the quantity supplied is at least 28 grams.19. The fourth deal relied on, the Crown says, was a delivery of four ounces to Ozer on 21 December 2006. Sergeant Pierce notes the key to the conversation is a payment of $22,000 for the lot and Ozer says, “Can you bring four?” Not to be overlooked is a reference that he will pay off all his debts. Sergeant Pierce does not postulate any defined quantity. I am satisfied the quantity supplied is not less than 56 grams.20. The fifth deal is to Harken which is Ozer I think. The information relied upon by the Crown is contained in some phone taps made on Christmas Day at 14.48. Harken asks for four for a friend and four for himself. The offender replies, “I’ll say forty. I’ll try to be less than forty minutes.” I have considered whether that reply constitutes a price fixing at $40,000 but I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt it does. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that not less than five half ounces were supplied, that is 70 grams. 21. The sixth deal relied upon is with Ozer. He wants “four, five make sure it's like the first batch.” Again the sum is not specified. Sergeant Pierce is able to set a quantity. I am satisfied it is not less than four times 14 grams, that is 56 grams.22. The seventh deal is with Ozer on 29 December 2008. It seems agreed that Ozer has obtained two ounces of ketamine for $4,000 which he regards as a good price for it. The offender is asked to “bring one” and Harken agrees to pay the difference. On the Crown case the “one” refers to an ounce, Sergeant Pierce regards this conversation as a deliberate contradiction and is consistent with a request by Harken to purchase “one” and on-sell this product. I note that at the time of his arrest the search did not turn up any ketamine which may support Sergeant Pierce’s interpretation. The starting figure of four grand appears below the range of going prices for an ounce of methamphetamine. I am unable to determine what sum is embraced in the term “the balance”. In all the circumstances I am satisfied the quantity of methamphetamine supplied was not less than 28 grams.23. The eighth deal is with Ozer later the same day. At the 16.52 call the offender says, “leaving now”. It would appear he made a delivery proximate to 16.52. Almost two hours later there is a second call at 18.32. CV asks for half an hour before making the delivery presumably to organise the product. He is asked to bring “my one”, no price is discussed. Sergeant Pierce’s notes “reference to something possibly pre-arranged by two persons in the conversation”. I do not rule out that a pre-arrangement could have been made at the time of the earlier delivery of the quantity of methamphetamine earlier that afternoon. In the absence of anything more I am satisfied the quantity of meth supplied was not less than 28 grams.24. The ninth supply relied upon occurs on 7 January 2009. At 13.51 a Peter Bianchi phoned asking for “three tickets”. As a consequence of this call police observed Bianchi arrive at the offender’s residence, shortly leave, return to his vehicle and drive away. Shortly after he was stopped, Bianchi’s vehicle was searched and approximately three ounces of crystal methamphetamine was found. The offender in June 2009 admitted to supply 3 ounces of methamphetamine for $21,000, that is $7,000 per ounce making a total of 84 ounces on that occasion. The nine deals relied upon by the Crown established beyond reasonable doubt the offender supplied no less than 400 grams of methamphetamine. 25. From the telephone intercepts before me I am satisfied during this twenty-five day period the offender made other substantial supplies of prohibited drugs, including to a man who spoke of two step and five step ladders, another of three bottles and yet another “like the same but twice” and another “just the normal”. I understand from admissions made that the three bottles are admitted as three 350 ml bottles of GHB. Further I am satisfied that these twenty-five days of transactions is a snapshot of a more extended period of dealing undertaken by CV sometime after he was released to parole. Of the twenty-five days phone records before me that have been tendered show he was active on nineteen of those twenty-five days. 26. While there is little doubt the offender was addicted to drugs the level of his distribution and financial gains from dealing far outstripped his own substantial expenditure. I am satisfied his capacity to rent inner city accommodation, furnish his apartment, have use of a rented car were made possible from the proceeds of his drug dealing. I am satisfied his gross turnover from the sale of drugs during that twenty-five day period exceeded $100,000. In reaching that calculation I have applied a price of $7,000 per 28 grams only to the quantity relied upon to prove the second count in the indictment.Objective Criminality27. From the facts as he finds them to be a sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant case which criminality of drug supplies of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these three offences is evaluated. Objective criminality obviously has the most important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. 28. Courts and legislature have made it clear that drug supplying is an unacceptable criminal activity. It is not difficult to understand why drug supplying is a criminal activity. It is an attack upon the public health of citizens of the state. Contrary to the impression offenders may well entertain initially, it is not a social but rather antisocial behaviour because it undermines the public health of good men and women in our state. Courts have long recognised that in assessing objective seriousness of a drug offence it is necessary to have regard to the drugs potential for harm. Harm to others when inflicted by someone or contributed to by someone is antisocial conduct of a high order. Distributing half ounces and ounces of methamphetamine, contributing to addiction of drug addicts is antisocial conduct, in my view, of a huge dimension. For some, if not for most, drugs such as those I am concerned with, methamphetamine, can be addictive. It is otherwise destructive, causing or contributing to mental health problems, aggression. It creates or sustains drug addicts. A drug addict is a human being whose capacity to function and feel human is smothered to a greater or lesser extent by the level of his addiction. The real essence of the criminal harm of drug suppliers is that in a greater or a lesser way they are contributing to the disenabling of other human beings. As I said, it undermines public health.29. Associated with it are other forms of crime such as robbery, break enters and steals, that is losses to working men and women, of property usually purchased as a result of their own efforts in the community. That is their own working efforts. Associated with those robberies is trauma, emotional and psychological damage to victims, caused by violence and intrusion to others. The drug suppliers contribute to all that. True it is they are not directly there, but their fingerprints are all over the people who are.30. The spending of money on drugs by addicts without any corresponding productivity by drug dealers amounts to monumental transference of wealth. Funny thing about this day and age as we are interested in what happens economically in our community and the transference of money in huge sums, billions of dollars a year, without productive reproduction is sapping the lifeblood out of the economic community. On any view then drug trafficking is antisocial conduct of a high order.31. The criminality of each of these offences is centred against the background of ongoing drug dealing, principally, but not exclusively, in methylamphetamine in quantities that are for the on-supply by purchasers, that is criminal associates. Negotiations are conducted in terms to avoid detection - or in the event of detection full accountability for the criminality; and indeed even this accused’s own transport from home to delivery site is conducted in circumstances that make it a little bit more difficult for it to be detected who owns the vehicle he is driving in because it is hired. This case is a classic example of that. He gets the benefit of aburden of proof beyond reasonable doubt. That is appropriate and proper that he should, but it is only because I cannot understand the language in which he is talking.32. Steps and care are taken in delivery to avoid detection. The two deemed supply charges occur in circumstances where police have disrupted an attempt to supply. In the search of CV’s residence quantities of methamphetamine destined for supply in the very near future are found. The offender’s attitude on arrest was not one of contrition but rather one of seeking to avoid his own guilt. 33. The potential for the harm to the health of others was serious and ongoing given the quantities being disturbed from his store. He is clearly at least two steps away from end users putting him relatively high but certainly by no means at the highest on the distribution tree. He was of course purchasing his product from one or more persons higher up. That distribution was part of his system of minimising his liability if caught. Had he had large quantities of drug on his premises obviously his criminality would have been greater. His gross turnover at the time of arrest was in excess of $100,000 per twenty-five days. Even assuming his business did not grow and the income stream was constant for a year his annual gross would have been in the vicinity of $1.5 million per annum. Of course the criminality I am dealing with is only for a twenty-five day period. 34. In assessing the objective criminality of the third count one needs to bear in mind,· It was part of an ongoing criminal activity.· Supplies to those who will on supply.· Supply to those who were willingly dealing in drugs, that is there is no attempt to force drugs on anybody other than those who want them.· The quantity supplied was not less than 400 grams.· The supply was for financial gain, ie, a sum not less $100,000.· The supplier was addicted to the product he was supplying.· There was a degree of professionalism about the supply business including the use of codes, variable pickup points, the use of hire cars and other practices including keeping reduced amounts of stock on premises. 
    35. The large commercial quantity begins at a 1,000 grams. The commercial quantity begins at 250 grams. 400 grams is well within the commercial range but still below the halfway point. The offender is two suppliers removed from the end user. He is purchasing his stock albeit in larger amounts than he is selling but apparently not in great bulk. He was addicted to the product I have no doubt. His addiction mitigated in his own mind the evilness of the trade he was involved in and for reasons related to his own addiction he refused to acknowledge the potential for health harm related to his actions.36. I would put his objective criminality in respect of the third offence as approaching and closely approaching the mid-range of seriousness. In other words the criminality does not quite reach on its own objective facts the mid- range of seriousness. 37. The first two charges on the indictment are serious offences. In assessing their seriousness I note in each case the prohibited drug did not make its way into the community. In respect of the first charge the transaction has been all but completed. On the Crown case delivery of the goods had not been completed so that the possession of the drugs remained with the offender, although that is not quite how his statement would put it. In respect of the second charge the Crown case is those drugs were in his possession for the purpose of supply. It was only the intervention of police in each case that prevented the drugs from reaching the community. These offences are so serious that imprisonment, the heaviest form of punishment known to the law, are called for in each case.Subjective Criminality38. Counsel for the offender sought to obtain second hearsay confirmation of histories given to Dr Roberts, a psychiatrist, and to Christine Bridekirk, author of the Department of Corrective Services Alcohol and Other Drugs report. I should note that Dr Roberts is a psychiatrist retained by the defence. That approach was not challenged by the Crown, thus the evidence is before me with no objection. I should indicate that I am extremely careful about the weight I will give to second-hand hearsay confirmation of any self serving statements that appear in either history. Frankly, the proposition that a non-drug using partner would have full knowledge of her drug using partner’s conduct including his conduct overseas is stretching the elasticity of history evidence too, too far.Family Background and Relationships39. CV was born in Chile, emigrated in about 1972/73 with his parents and older brother when he, CV, was two. He is presently approaching his fortieth birthday. His father was prone to heavy drinking and parties. His parents were hardworking, both holding two jobs each. It seems CV was a latch key child. There was constant argument with verbal and physical abuse in the home. That his parents spoke in broken English and their level of abuse at home were factors he claims making him feel self conscious in what he regarded as an upper class Anglo-Saxon environment. 40. His partner BM has known him for more than ten years. The two have been in what I would call an off and on relationship since 2005. He has a son , born in the first half of 2008. BM experienced post natal depression and attributed the tensions in the marriage to that cause. With heavy drug using and drug dealing partner, to single out post natal depression as the primary cause of tension within the relationship seems to me charitable beyond belief, to say the least.Education, Employment Skills41. CV attended catholic schools where he claims there was physical abuse at the hands of priests and sexual abuse towards classmates. He left school having completed the Higher School Certificate. His first employment was at a real estate agency. He obtained his real estate licence and auctioneer’s licence, he completed a year at TAFE College although the course attended has not been specified. I have suspected that it related to the real estate and auctioneer licences. These are careers that his criminal convictions deny him access to in future. That is not extra-curial punishment of this offence because of his prior offending, these career paths seem to me to have already been blocked out. 42. He has owned a petrol station. He has IT skills and worked in that field. He owned a pizza shop prior to his last conviction. That was sold by BM on his behalf not only because he was in custody but her pregnancy meant she was unable to continue working in the shop. He is not without work skills, experience or work ethic. Indeed his work ethic is also apparent in his total commitment to drug supply during that twenty-five day period.General Health43. He smokes twenty-five cigarettes daily. He appears overweight and unfit. He complained to Dr Roberts of experiencing pins and needles in arms and legs when he lay down. He has asthma which is controlled by Ventolin. He says he had recovered from Hepatitis B in 2004. Otherwise there do not appear to be any major health problems that should impact upon his rehabilitation.Mental Health Issues44. When interviewed in prison by Dr Roberts, CV complained of suffering “from depression secondary to the situation he found himself in”. I doubt that that is an actual quote of CV but suspect that it is an interpretation by Dr Roberts. He described himself as “being frustrated not only with the position in which he has put himself but the effect of his behaviour upon his family.” Dr Roberts diagnosed a substance abuse - substance dependency disorder. Dr Roberts also canvassed the likelihood of a personality disorder diagnosis. Although he expanded upon the symptoms and cause of such diagnosis it is to be noted he does not make the diagnosis. Dr Roberts’ opinion was that the accused’s presentation at the consultation was totally explicable on the basis of substance abuse. 45. Dr Roberts recommended a treatment plan where long term management of CV’s substance abuse - substance dependency disorder should occur following release from custody. That recommendation was made against the background that the doctor had been told CV had not used drugs in custody. Dr Roberts also recommended that a drug rehabilitation program be a portion of any sentence the Court considers appropriate. I note the Court cannot order anyone into a drug rehabilitation program as part of a sentence or otherwise. He recommended he be under a treating and experienced, in the field psychiatrist on a regular basis for two years after release.Drug and Alcohol Abuse46. Much of Dr Roberts’ opinion rests upon the history given to him by the offender, two court attendance notices and the offender’s presentation.47. There is also before me Christine Bridekirk’s Alcohol or Other Drug report earlier referred to. It documents a history of alcohol consumption at fourteen, monthly binge drinking with friends, a continuation of alcohol consumption in varying degrees throughout his adult life. Cannabis:- He first consumed cannabis aged twenty. He admits to smoking cannabis twice weekly when in the community. Amphetamines:- He says he was introduced to these at the age of twenty-five. His initial use was described as recreational. Later he relied upon amphetamines to get through heavy workloads and stressful situations. At twenty-seven he progressed from snorting and drinking to intravenous consumption on a daily basis. His abstinence he says was limited mainly by incarceration. The switch to methamphetamine was made in 2005 because of its increased strength. 48. Exhibit 4 constitutes two photos of the offender apparently taken at different times prior to his incarceration in 2007. In both he is shirtless and severe track marks from injection abuse of the arm are visible on each arm.49. Christine Bridekirk opines CV’s criminal behaviour is strongly linked to his drug use. I am prepared to accept that may well be so. He claims to have been using 1 gram of methylamphetamine daily. He claims he was using his supply to fund and supply his own drug use. I have already made the point his supply of drugs to others was far in excess of what he needed to fund his own drug use. At 1 gram per day his drug use would cost him $7,000 for a twenty-eight day period on the figures I have used. That is 28 grams or an ounce for $7,000. During the twenty-five day period his gross turnover was in excess of $100,000, that is more than ten times what he needed on my figures for a twenty-eight period.Character and Criminal History50. I have reviewed most of his criminal history at the outset of these remarks. What becomes obvious is that any claim for leniency on that account would be hopeless. His criminality has long been associated with drugs, drug use and drug supply. Further at the time of this offence the parole he breached was parole in respect of a drug related crime. 51. I have noted his strong work ethic. Since March 2009 he has come to a position where he seeks to assist authorities associated with the administration of criminal justice. I shall return to this momentarily.Breach of Parole52. This offending conduct constitutes a serious breach and a continuing breach of his parole. His breach of parole by any criminal act and even more so by a continuing criminal acts constitutes an aggravation of the criminality of the offences I am dealing with.Attitude to Offence53. I have already noted he attempted to exculpate himself from the deemed supply charge and the circumstances of his arrest on 16/01/09 as demonstrating an absence of contrition at that time. S 21(3) requires an offender to provide evidence that he has accepted responsibility for his actions and acknowledges any injury, loss or damage caused by his actions before remorse can be taken into account. I note in all other instances where the use of the phrase “the offender” it is a direct and personal connection between him or her and the verb following, eg the offender was provoked, the offender was acting under duress, the offender was a person of good character. There is no reason to make an exception when the onus is put upon the offender to provide acceptance of responsibility for his act. CV certainly has not entered the witness box nor is there any written statement or letter from him. In those circumstances there is no evidence that he accepts responsibility or if it be known to him that his actions have caused injury, loss or damage. 54. These appear to be pre-conditions for having remorse shown by him considered as a mitigating factor pursuant to s 21A(3)(i). There is evidence from BM that the accused rings her six times daily and tells her he will never do anything like this again. There is also evidence from four character witnesses that he has expressed regret to them. Given each of these references makes reference to regret and remorse I do not rule out some orchestration, not necessarily by the offender himself or the reporting of expressions “remorse and regret”. If those expressions stood on their own I would given little weight to them but there is also his co-operation with persons involved in the administration of justice that would be consistent with him really having regrets.55. The cases establish that common law principles of sentencing work in tandem with the provisions of s 21A, see Way’s (R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168) case. Evidence of remorse and regret is available to mitigate pursuant to the common law. I make it clear I have given some weight in sentencing outcome of his expressions of regret and remorse.....His honour then went on to deal with other mattersSetting the Sentence- Deterrence61. The law requires that general and personal deterrence be given proper weight in the sentencing determination. I record that I have done so. The maximum penalty for supply an indictable quantity of prohibited drugs is fifteen years imprisonment. The maximum penalty for supply a quantity of prohibited drug greater than the commercial quantity is twenty years imprisonment and I have mentioned the standard non-parole period of ten years. Standard Non-Parole Period Does Not Apply62. I have determined the objective criminality of the commercial quantity charge falls below the mid range of objective seriousness and explained my reasons for so doing earlier. In those circumstances I would not be required to apply the standard non-parole period. I have noted factors of aggravation as I dealt with my assessment of the objective seriousness. I note two important factors found in s 21A(3) that would also take this matter outside the requirement that a standard non-parole period apply, including the plea of guilty.... So to hold does not constitute double counting of the plea of guilty....Form 1 Matters63. The Form 1 matters will drive the sentence upwards in respect of the sentence imposed on the commercial supply charge. I have assumed all of the matters on the Form 1 could have been dealt with summarily. Their impact upon the overall sentence will reflect a level of seriousness that might be reflected in totality of summary offending flowing from those offences. Some Cumulation of the Sentences64. While all offending conduct was brought to a head on 16 January 2009 I am of the view the sentences for the first two matters should be partly cumulative to the commercial supply. Initially I was minded to make the cumulation twelve months. I have reduced that to six months. My logic is that I intended to reduce the overall sentences by fifty-five percent for reasons earlier given. To accumulate the sentence as initially intended an extra twelve months would deprive the offender of the full value of the discount.Applying the Discounts65. In respect of the first offence I would have set a fixed term of three years discounted by fifty-five percent and rounded up that constitutes a reduction of nineteen months and fifteen days leaving a sentence of sixteen months and fifteen days or one year, four months, fifteen days. 66. In respect of the second offence I would have set an overall sentence of four years imprisonment. I would have discounted that by fifty-five percent and rounded up the reduction amounts to twenty-six months, fifteen days leaving a sentence of twenty-one months fifteen days or one year, nine months, fifteen days. 67. In respect of the third offence I would have set an overall sentence of eight years discounted by fifty-five percent and rounded up, that constitutes a reduction of fifty-two months and fifteen days leaving forty-three months and fifteen days. Put in English you can understand, three years, seven months, fifteen days.68. The first two sentences will be fixed terms. Special Circumstances69. I have decided to find special circumstances.... I have been asked to regard him as serving a sentence on protection. Currently he is not doing so. I am aware that there may be an explanation for that but I have no evidence that the explanation hinted at is in fact true. In my own experience that is true and will remain true for the whole of the sentence....70. The finding of special circumstances acknowledges .... the arduousness and additional stress of prison as a consequence of giving assistance. Again I note this is no double counting. The discount earlier referred to was given because of the benefit to the administration of justice. The finding of special circumstances arises by recognition of the consequence of assistance upon the offender.Sentencing71. CV I convict you of the offence that you on 16 January 2009 at Camperdown supplied a prohibited drug, to wit, crystalline methamphetamine. For that offence you are convicted to a fixed term of one year, four months, fifteen days commencing on 16 January 2009 and expiring on 30 May this year. 72. Likewise I convict you of an offence in the very same terms being the 150 plus grams of methamphetamine in your home. I sentence you to a term of imprisonment of one year, nine months and fifteen days being a fixed term commencing on the same date 16 January 2009 and expiring on 30 November this year. 73. Finally I convict you of the offence that you on 22 December 2008, between that date and 16 January 2009, at Sydney, supplied an amount of prohibited drug, namely methamphetamine, being an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that drug. In respect of that offence you are sentenced to one year, eleven months and fifteen days. That is as close as I can get to two years, from 16 July 2009 expiring on 1 July 2011.74. I set a balance of term expiring on 1 March 2013. I order your release to parole on 1 July 2011. 75. I recommend, I cannot order you, but I recommend that you attend a full time rehabilitation centre located in New South Wales for a period not less than six months of your parole. That is a recommendation that will be taken up with you and the Parole Board. Have a seat.HIS HONOUR: I make an order for the destruction of all drugs. HIS HONOUR: I order that pursuant to s 18(1) cash in the sum of $1200.00 found at Camperdown in a silver Ford motor vehicle, registration number WTL636 Victoria, be forfeited to the state of New South Wales. I also order that cash in the sum of $14,950 found in premises rented by the offender in Missenden Road, Camperdown be forfeited to the state of New South Wales.

      SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR : Franco Penza and Joshua DiMaria were found guilty by a jury on 30 July 2009 of the murder of Christian Minotte on 17 April 2006. The trial was conducted by the Crown on the basis that the offenders went to the home of the victim, armed with a firearm, with the intention of stealing drugs and/or money concealed in a wall cavity in the laundry of the premises. At some stage, they were confronted by the victim and a struggle took place, culminating in the discharge of the firearm into the head of the victim at close range. The Crown maintained that, the discharge of the firearm in the course of carrying out either a joint criminal enterprise to break enter and steal whilst armed, or a joint criminal enterprise to rob whilst armed, was accompanied by an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm on the victim, or that the discharge of the firearm was contemplated by the offenders as a possible incident of the commission of either of the relevant felonies. 
     
      
    2 The Crown now accepts that the appropriate basis upon which the offenders should be sentenced is the latter, that is, felony murder. In these circumstances, the objectivity gravity of the offence falls to be assessed absent an intention to kill or inflict really serious injury. This factor alone is not determinative of whether the offence should be characterised as below, at, or above the mid range of objective gravity. It is relevant however to note that, since the introduction of the standard non parole period for this offence on 1 February 2003, there have been no instances of felony murder (as far as my research has been able to find) that have attracted that term. I return to this issue below. 
     
      
    3 The defence depended principally upon the evidence of Mr DiMaria, in that it was asserted that both offenders went to the premises unarmed, that they knocked on the front door, and called out from the back veranda of the house next door in an effort to ensure that the victim was not home. They had formed the intention to steal drugs (cocaine) from the wall cavity in the laundry. They began to demolish the wall to gain access to the drugs when they were confronted by the victim, who was armed. The victim and Mr DiMaria engaged in a struggle, during which the firearm accidentally discharged, killing the victim. Mr Penza did not give evidence, but his co-offender’s evidence was relied upon to found a submission that Mr Penza had run from the scene before the discharge of the firearm. 
     
      
    4 Mr DiMaria’s evidence was patently rejected by the jury. There remains very little evidence upon which I can determine the events leading up to the discharge of the firearm. The nature of the acts carried out by each of them, their respective roles in the confrontation with the victim, where that confrontation commenced and under what circumstances remain largely matters of speculation. For these reasons, the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence is problematic : see R v J B and R J H (1999) NSWCCA 93 at (33). Putting Mr DiMaria’s evidence to one side, the following represents the basis for the findings I have made for the purposes of sentence. 
     
      
       
      Findings of Fact on Sentence. 
       
      
    5 It was not disputed that the offenders consumed a large amount of alcohol in each other’s company in the afternoon and evening of 16 April 2006. By the time they went to the victim’s house, they were highly intoxicated, although there was some evidence of a visit to a service station, shortly before the incident, where cigarettes were purchased. I am of the view that the jury’s verdict is consistent with satisfaction beyond reasonable doubt that the offenders were armed, but a failure to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that either of the offenders had the requisite specific intent to commit the offence of murder, principally because of their intoxication.  
     
      
    6 It is also apparent that there was some kind of struggle between Mr DiMaria and the victim. The victim had a number of grazes and bruises on his right side and on both lower limbs consistent with blunt force injury. Raised voices and yelling were also heard by a number of neighbours in the early hours of the morning. 
     
      
    7 The most troubling aspect of the encounter between the offenders and the victim centred on a gutter mark in the door frame of the rear door and evidence of the discharge of a firearm from the back veranda, through the open door, into the kitchen of the victim’s home. It was the Crown case that the offenders had fired at the victim whilst he was in the house, at some time before the victim came down the stairs and was fatally shot. The defence case maintained that other unknown persons, most probably rival drug dealers with whom the victim was in dispute, had discharged a firearm into the house. That was an important plank of the defence case, because it refuted an essential element in the Crown case, namely that the offenders must have gone to the premises armed. As I have already noted, the jury’s verdicts establish that they were armed. 
     
      
    8 There was some evidence consistent with the offenders’ attempts to ensure that the victim was not at home when they first arrived. The occupant (Mr P) of a house which overlooked the back yard of the victim’s house observed a man standing on the rear veranda of the house adjacent to the victim’s house, calling out to someone. It was about 4:20am. The witness also heard sounds consistent with wrestling, and with someone jumping over a colourbond fence. A loud gunshot was followed by a short silence, then two more gunshots in quick succession. The witness then saw a man, consistent with Mr DiMaria’s appearance, standing on the rear balcony of the victim’s house. The man then walked down the stairs and up the side of the house. Other neighbours gave evidence of hearing 2 or 3 loud bangs in the early hours of that morning, variously between about 1:30am and 4:20am. However, Mr P was the only witness who looked out onto the rear of the relevant premises on the night in question.  
     
      
    9 I am of the view that the offenders were indeed concerned to find out if the victim was at home, given that the victim knew them both well and he was known to defend himself by the use of firearms. When the victim did not respond to their calls, for whatever reason, the offenders went to the laundry and began to break open the wall to gain access to the drugs and money secreted therein. Something alerted the offenders to the presence of the victim inside the house, resulting in one or both offenders mounting the steps to the back door. The nature of the confrontation at that point is a matter of speculation but I accept that one of the offenders discharged a firearm into the kitchen from the rear balcony. It would appear that either or both of them then retreated hurriedly down the stairs where the victim caught up with them. A physical fight ensued adjacent to the laundry, in the course of which the victim’s blood was smeared on the laundry door frame. Within a short time, the fatal shot was fired by one of the offenders, at reasonably close range, given that the bullet passed through the brain and was located under the skin on the other side of the skull. The angle of the entry wound indicates that the victim was either falling at the time or had fallen and was at least partially prone on the ground. 
     
      
    10 Mr Penza’s counsel in particular relied upon the evidence of Mr P in order to support the evidence of Mr DiMaria that Mr Penza ran from the rear yard before the victim was shot. The sound of something striking the fence was consistent, it was said, with Mr Penza jumping the fence shortly before the three gunshots. I do not make that finding, principally because the noise from the fence may be explained by any number of circumstances and the jury must have rejected Mr DiMaria’s evidence in its entirety. 
     
      
    11 Given the absence of the murder weapon and the rejection of Mr DiMaria’s evidence, I am unable to determine who fired the fatal shot. I approach sentence therefore on the basis that each of the offenders are equally liable for the death of the victim. I am also of the view that the victim was not armed at the time, although I accept that he was known to keep guns and that the offenders expected resistance if he became aware of their intention. Whatever the victim’s attitude towards those who might rob him, Mr Penza was, for all intents and purposes, a son to the victim and Mr DiMaria was a family friend. It is unlikely, in my view, that the victim armed himself once he became aware of the presence of Mr Penza. 
     
      
    12 The decision by the offenders to go to the victim's home and help themselves to his stash of drugs was an impulsive one made whilst heavily intoxicated. There was some planning, which could hardly be described as sophisticated or considered. The offender Penza was on bail awaiting sentence for an offence of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug. On 28 April 2006 he received a sentence of 3 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 15 months.  
     
      
       
      The Objective Gravity of the Offence 
       
      
    13 The Crown's argument that a felony murder does not necessarily warrant the imposition of a non-parole period below the standard non parole period is well founded. In Aslett v R [2006] NSWCCA 360, it was observed that where an offender :- 
     
      
       
        
        carried [a] loaded gun in circumstances where he contemplated resistance, took it out of his pocket when resistance occurred and deliberately discharged it, [a] murder committed in these circumstances may be as serious as a murder committed with intent to kill  
        R v Mills,  
        unreported, NSWCCA, (3 April 1995);  
        R v Jacobs  
        and  
        Mehajer

        R v EM  
        [2005] NSWSC 212 per James J.  
        
       
      
    14 To the extent that guidance can be obtained from a perusal of decisions of this Court and of the Court of Criminal Appeal in respect of felony murder, either before or after the introduction of the standard non parole period, there is a surprising uniformity in the sentences that have been imposed. In R v Smale [2005] NSWSC 903 a sentence of 18 years imprisonment was imposed after trial in respect of a felony murder committed in the course of a robbery on a hotel. In R v Nguyen [2007] NSWSC 389 a sentence of 18 years imprisonment was imposed after a plea of guilty for a murder committed upon a shopkeeper in the course of a robbery whilst the offender was on parole. In that case Whealey J. determined that the offence fell not far below the mid range of objective gravity. In R v Silvano [2006] NSWSC 832, the shooting death of a co-offender during the commission of an armed robbery was assessed as “just below the middle of the range”. Lastly in R v BH [2009] NSWSC 358 a sentence of 17 years imprisonment was imposed upon a juvenile after a plea of guilty for the offence of murder committed in the course of a robbery. 
     
      
    15 The assault upon the victim in his own home places this offence in a somewhat different category, although there are features of the cases referred to above that are arguably of a more aggravating nature. In Nguyen, Whealey J referred to the fact that the death of the shopkeeper occurred after the offender had brandished a knife and persisted in his demands for money, ultimately stabbing the victim several times. I accept that in this case the offenders’ capacity to exercise judgement was affected by the combination of their intoxication and ingestion of illicit drugs, so that when they were confronted by the victim, the firearm was discharged spontaneously.  
     
      
    16 The offence was committed out of the need to obtain cocaine, a drug which both offenders had used since adolescence. This does not reduce the requirement to reflect general deterrence in the sentence to be imposed. However, as the discussion of Mr Penza’s background below amply demonstrates, he comes within the ambit of this statement by Wood CJ at CL in R v Henry & Ors. [1999] NSWCCA 111 at 273 :-  
     
      
       
        
        [his] addiction was not a matter of personal choice but was attributable to some other event for which the offender was not primarily responsible, ……. where it occurred at a very young age, ……, so that [his] ability to exercise appropriate judgment or choice was incomplete;  
        
       
      
    17 Taking these matters into account, I would assess the objective gravity of the offence as moderately below the midrange. It remains to consider the subjective circumstances of each of the offenders. The reports tendered on behalf of each offender outline their respective personal histories. Both of the offenders continue to maintain their innocence. Thus, there is no demonstration of remorse and their respective prospects of rehabilitation are difficult to assess in the face of a refusal to take responsibility for the offence. 
     
      
    18 In Mr DiMaria’s case, there are a number of offences before the Court pursuant to a certificate under section 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. This offender has asked the Court to deal with these matters when imposing a sentence for the offence of murder. These offences arise in the following circumstances. After the victim was shot, Mr DiMaria made off with a large amount of money from the wall cavity, most, if not all of which, he spent during an extensive overseas trip. He fled the country on 18 April 2006. He arranged to meet his girlfriend, for whom he also bought a ticket, in Malaysia. Ultimately, Mr DiMaria returned to Australia under a false name. He was arrested by police on 24 August 2007 after a car he was driving under the name of Watkins was stopped. He also had other identity documents in the name of Watkins in his possession. It is accepted by the Crown that concurrent sentences may be imposed for these offences. 
     
      
       
      The Offender Penza 
       
      
    19 This offender's background is described within a report prepared under the hand of Mr Borenstein, clinical psychologist, dated 17 October 2009, as ""a tragic dysfunctional childhood and adolescence."" The offender was born into a family in Fairfield with two older sisters, a younger brother and a younger sister. He knows very little of his father. His parents separated when he was five years of age. Mr Penza lived with his mother for the first 10 years of his life until his older sister convinced him to live with their father.  
     
      
    20 From that age, this offender was not subject to any discipline or any regulation of his behaviour. Mr Penza's father had remarried and had two children at that time. The offender left his father's home not long after he arrived, roaming the streets and living in abandoned houses. He did not attend school. Not surprisingly the Department of Community Services became involved with Mr Penza from the age of about 10. He was placed in Barnardos and a variety of foster homes, from which he escaped on numerous occasions.  
     
      
    21 At about the age of 11, the victim and his wife fostered Mr Penza, despite the fact that they already had three children of their own. The victim worked as a brickies labourer but had a lengthy history of supplying prohibited drugs, for which he was ultimately imprisoned. It appears that Mr Penza's second oldest sister was also fostered to the Minotte family, by which time she was also drug affected. She committed suicide at the age of 23. 
     
      
    22 The offender claims that he was introduced to drugs by the victim's wife. He commenced using cannabis at the age of 11. By the age of 13 he was using cocaine. He did not inject drugs. He also abused alcohol, mainly spirits. He was allowed complete freedom and would stay away for days if not weeks on end. He was completely unsupervised and was emotionally and physically neglected. The offender describes a chaotic household where there were no rules and where he was rarely fed. He had some contact with his parents but felt unable to return to their home. For a period of 12 months, the offender went to Queensland to live with his aunt but returned to Sydney and to the Minotte family.  
     
      
    23 For the first 10 years of Mr Penza's life with the family, the victim was absent serving a term of imprisonment of 10 years. The offender met the victim for the first time when the offender was 19 years of age. The offender knew that there were drugs and cash buried all over the house. Drug taking and drug supply appeared to be an everyday feature of domestic life. Mr Penza was familiar from an early age with cannabis, cocaine, crack cocaine, ecstasy, amphetamines, heroin, ice and LSD. 
     
      
    24 The offender’s treatment unremarkably resulted in behavioural problems. He was expelled from school on one occasion, was dealing in drugs from the age of 14 and was in and out of juvenile facilities for offences relating to the theft of motor vehicles, stolen goods and malicious damage. The offender's criminal history includes a number of drug-related offences. It is largely unbroken from 1997 to the commission of the instant offence. 
     
      
    25 In his adult years, Mr Penza lived next door to the victim together with the middle son of the victim and his wife. They were renting the premises and supporting themselves through the supply of drugs and theft. Mr Penza worked intermittently as a brickies labourer. Mr Penza has a child as a result of a relationship which commenced at the age of 15. The offender's son is now aged 11 and lives with the mother’s parents.  
     
      
    26 Mr Penza is presently 27 years of age. He has completed a number of drug and alcohol courses since entering prison. He has in the past attempted to wean himself off drugs and alcohol but has met with limited success. Given the environment within which he was raised and what can only be described as a complete lack of socialisation, the offender will require long-term psychological intervention if he is to have any prospect of integration into the community upon his release. He is barely literate and is assessed at low to average intelligence. He has however acquired some insight into the causes of his present situation and appreciates that his rehabilitation will be a difficult and lengthy process. To his credit, he does not bear any ill will towards the Minotte family. He denies any malice towards the victim. 
     
      
    The Offender DiMaria 
     
      
    27 This offender was born in Sydney to a family of six brothers and two sisters. He is presently 26 years of age. An older brother died in 2000. The offender's parents separated when the offender was 18 years of age. He was educated to year 7 at a sports high school because of some prowess as an athlete. He was asked to leave because of his behavioural problems, said to be the result of a learning disability acquired from an accident on the 10th of February 1987 when he was struck by a vehicle as a pedestrian at the age of 3. 
     
      
    28 The offender left the family home at the age of 12 and lived an itinerant life until the age of 18 years. At the age of 16 he became involved with a self-help programme for troubled youths in Pendle Hill. Despite some drug abuse in the course of his adolescence, he determined to cease using drugs at the age of 18 so that he could obtain an apprenticeship as a panel beater at Artarmon. He enrolled in a TAFE college and commenced playing rugby league. It appears that the apprenticeship ceased because of the offender's learning difficulties and a similar position at Granville terminated with the offender’s dismissal. He has essentially been unemployed since that time apart from brief part-time work on building sites. 
     
      
    29 This offender's poly-substance abuse, which included cocaine, ecstasy and for a time heroin, apparently has its origins in a history of domestic violence in the offender's home, where his father would frequently assault his mother as well as the offender. A report under the hand of Tim Watson Munro dated 22 October 2009, refers to psychometric reports that reveal a very low level of intelligence, consistent with the offender’s significant difficulties with planning, and problem solving. However, Mr Watson Munro assesses the offender presently within the borderline category. 
     
      
    30 The offender’s criminal history is less extensive than his co-offender but contains similar convictions for property and drug offences dating from 1997. 
     
      
    31 The offender expressed deep regret in relation to the death of the victim. According to the report, the offender has suffered from depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment for much of his life. These limitations have been compounded by drug and alcohol abuse. There is some basis for concluding that the offender is now motivated to further progress his rehabilitation. He recognizes the need to remain drug-free and to undergo treatment aimed at the acquisition of broader social skills. 
     
      
       
      The Sentence 
       
      
    32 The sentence to be imposed upon each of the offenders must take account of the fact that murder is regarded as the most serious offence in the criminal calendar, carrying a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non parole period of 20 years imprisonment. The objective gravity of the offence cannot be mitigated by the fact that the victim was engaged in the commission of other criminal offences, or by the fact that the victim and his wife had on any view provided an appalling environment within which to raise a vulnerable and psychologically damaged child. However, it is understandable, particularly in the case of Mr Penza, that the dysfunctional childhood and adolescence described above was a breeding ground for escalating criminality, to the extent that Mr Penza ‘s culpability for this offence must be assessed in that light.  
     
      
    33 Both of the offenders are young males who will spend a substantial proportion of their productive lives in custody. I take that factor into account, together with the subjective circumstances of each offender, in order to find special circumstances. This is in my view an obvious example of the need for a longer period of supervision to allow the offenders some chance of adopting a normal life within the community. That said, the non-parole period must not be reduced to the point where it fails to reflect the objective gravity of the offence.  
     
      
    34 I have also had regard to the victim impact statements which were read to the Court by members of the victim's family. The Court acknowledges that the family has lost a father, grandfather and husband and that they have experienced a sense of betrayal on the part of Mr Penza. There are however well established limits to the role that a victim impact statement plays in the sentencing exercise. It cannot influence the proper exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    35 Taking all of these matters into account I propose to sentence the offenders as follows :- 
     
      
       
      Franco Penza, you are convicted of the murder of Christian Minotte. I sentence you to a non parole period of 13 years to date from 27 July 2007, expiring 26 July 2020, with a balance of term of five years, expiring 26 July 2025. You are eligible for release on 27 July 2020. 
       
      
     Joshua DiMaria, you are convicted of the murder of Christian Minotte. I sentence you to a non parole period of 13 years to date from 24 August 2007, expiring 23 August 2020, with a balance of term of five years expiring 23 August 2025. You are eligible for release on 24 August 2020. 
     
      
       
      Pursuant to s 167 of the  
      Criminal Procedure Act 
       1986, I convict you of the following offences and impose the following sentences :- 
       
       
      On each of three counts of Goods in Custody under s 527C(1)(a) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900, I impose a sentence of 3 months imprisonment to date from 24 August 2007. On each of two counts of Use Instrument under s 300(2) of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900, I impose a fixed term of 2 years imprisonment to date from 24 August 2007. On one count of Knowingly make a false statement under s 307B of the  
      Crimes Act 
       1900, I impose a sentence of 9 months imprisonment to date from 24 August 2007.

     JUDGMENT 
     1. This court, as are others, becomes daily more concerned with the increasing percentage of Aboriginal men and women who are in custody. By the time an offender stands before a court the options open to the court are limited and constrained by legal principles. Such scope as there is in sentencing to avoid incarceration should be pursued so long as proper legal sentencing principles are respected. But before dramatic reductions in Aboriginal incarceration rates can be achieved there must be dramatic changes made in Aboriginal communities and daily living patterns that bring about a reduction in the need to call the police and invoke the procedures of the criminal justice system. 2. So much of domestic violence in Aboriginal household is linked to mammoth cannabis and amphetamine abuse, alcohol and past parental example to the modern day abuser. Once unleashed, the violence exhibited is so grossly disproportionate to the claimed domestic insult or injury said to be responsible for the outburst. So it is with T S who presented in court as manly, balanced, insightful, contrite and overwhelmed as he sat sober in the witness box willing to accept responsibility for his appalling criminal conduct. 3. The picture that emerges of the same man at Umina Beach on 27 September 2009 is one of an insatiable, self-focused, vicious man willing to humiliate through sexual dominance and psychological menace the mother of his children and his partner for the previous eleven years. 4. Today he is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct. As sentencing judge it falls to me to determine the appropriate sentence for the offences committed by him on 27 September 2009. It falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for these offences before this court committed by this offender harming this victim in the Umina community. Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1SCR 688 [80]. 5. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to the offender, subjective matters. The starting point for these assessments requires me to make findings of fact from the evidence before the court relating to both the offence and the offender. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found and the totality of the criminality exhibited as reflected by the charges, whether any of these offences attracts a standard non-parole period and ultimately the length of the parole period or periods; and finally of course the ultimate of the term of imprisonment or other penalty be imposed. 6. None of those issues can be determined until the primary facts have been determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined. See R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.  Facts7. TS and R J have been in an off and on domestic relationship for the past eleven years. Their relationship yielded three children, Trevor (not real name) eight, Tammy (not real name) seven, and Tina (not real name) four. In about March 2007 the complainant and offender no longer resided together. They had separated. She had taken the children, but no court orders were in place regarding access or custody. Since the separation she had allowed the offender to visit the children at her home and sometimes stay over. On those occasions the two would share a bed together and sometimes have consensual sexual intercourse.8. On 27 September 2008 in the first half hour of the day he unexpectedly attended her home, he knocked on the front door demanding to be allowed inside. He said he wanted to talk with her about their relationship. He was drunk. Also present in the house were her son and his friend. She told him he was not allowed inside. He responded that if she did not let him in he would kick the door in. Concerned, she opened the door and he entered. Once inside she sent her son and friend to their bedroom. 9. The complainant and the offender began to argue over the children. The argument turned to the issue of her not wanting to be with him. She left and went into the children’s bedrooms making up their beds. He went to the garage and a short time later she joined him in the garage in order to further discuss issues with him. 10. Once she was inside the garage he became angry as they engaged in a verbal argument. He picked a pair of scissors from the top of a washing machine and approached her. He cut her tracksuits pants from the bottom of the legs upwards. While doing this he was saying words to the effect, 
     
      
      “If you don’t give me the kids I will kill you. If you don’t want a family with me you’re not going to have a family at all.” 
       
      
    Those words are filled with menace. 11. He then ripped her pants off, leaving her naked from the waist down. He began to cut her shirt with scissors before ripping the shirt off, leaving her completely naked and exposed. He walked across the garage and stood next to a motorbike. He released the fuel with his right hand, causing petrol to pour from it. He placed his right hand under the motorcycle and began to flick fuel onto and toward her. He kept saying, “If I can’t have the kids with you no one can.” One cannot ignore the menace of petrol flying towards her as he said those words. He picked up a container of lighter fluid and sprayed it over her a number of times. 12. The facts do not disclose to what extent she was soaked. Any high degree of soaking of her would have to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Nonetheless, lighter fluid is highly inflammable. He stepped back and pulled out a lighter, flicking it, causing it to spark. He said to her from, presumably, some distance, “You don’t want me to get any closer.” Again, the menace in those words and that act cannot be underestimated. 13. He directed her to sit on a chair located in the garage. She complied. He grabbed her around the throat with his right hand, pulled her head back with his left before picking up a twenty centimetre black handled knife. He was now in front of her. He walked behind, letting go of her throat, but still holding her hair. While behind her he brought the knife to her face so that she could feel it touching her left eye. She was frightened, so frightened she could not register in her mind precisely what it was that he was saying. She heard him say he did not want anyone else playing father to his kids. She heard him say she had better not be having sex with anyone else. But other things were said she could not register.14. He took off his own pants, grabbed her head with his two hands, forced her to have his penis in her mouth and perform oral sex upon him. She was still seated in the chair, he in front of her, not wearing a condom. She tried to push him away but he, having the greater strength, was able to hold her there. That lasted for a couple of minutes and constitutes the first charge of aggravated sexual assault. 15. He let go of her head, pulled her up from the chair, pushed the chair away, bent her over so that her hands were now touching the floor. He then commenced penile/vaginal intercourse with her. While doing so repeatedly told her to shut up and slapping her on the back. She, for her part, was crying and repeatedly told him to stop. His response was, “If you make me stop I will fucking kill you.” He ejaculated inside her. That offence constitutes the second aggravated sexual assault charge. After he had finished he stood her up and asked her to get him a cigarette. She was unable to locate one. 16. He began to torment her. He walked into her bedroom, emptied her beside table, drawer onto the floor, and set fire to its contents. There were papers but nothing of value. He said, “The longer it takes you to find me a cigarette the longer it’s going to burn.” Again the menace in that was his capacity to control the flame, or was it to get out of hand. 17. Shortly, he put the fire out and returned to the garage. She stayed in the bedroom and dressed herself. While doing so she noticed a strong smell of smoke from the backyard. She walked into the yard and saw the clothing, earlier cut from her, burning on the ground. She tried to put out the fire, again was pushed away by him. He told her to go inside. He followed her inside to the loungeroom area. He sat her on the lounge, pulled down the pants and said, “Hurry, do your job.” A moment’s thought about the use of the word ‘job’ shows what their relationship had descended to. Intercourse between partners is meant to be a love affair, not work. She commenced performing oral sex upon him, fearful of what he may do if she declined. That offence constitutes the first item on the Form 1. 18. Shortly he made her get on to her hands and knees and for a second time had penile/vaginal intercourse with her. Again she was crying, telling him to stop. He ignored her until he ejaculated inside her. Having finished, both of them sat on the loungeroom floor for a short time before she left and went to the bedroom. He followed her. They both lay on the bed for some fifteen minutes. He started pulling down her pants. She tried to stop him but was unable to do so. For a third time he commenced having penile/vaginal intercourse with her, again to the point of ejaculation. Once finished he rolled over and went to sleep. That item constitutes the third item on the Form 1.19. I should have indicated that the earlier penile/vaginal intercourse was the second item on the Form 1.20. I am unable to determine from the information before me at what point in time the criminal activity ceased, but it must have been a substantial time after he had arrived at her premises. 21. At about 7.30am she retrieved her child and the friend and left the house. She went to her mother’s, crying, and told her mother of the assaults. Police were contacted and attended a short time later. 22. At about 2pm she was examined at the Gosford Hospital. On the right side of her neck was an area of lineal small red petechia. Petechia are areas of bruising that occur under the skin caused by pressure to an area. There was a large area of multiple abrasions over her upper thoracic spine that were both red and tender. The dorsal area of the right hand displayed an area of dark purple bruising. There were three areas of tender, superficial linear abrasion to her fossa navicularis and inner labia minora, consistent with forcible sexual intercourse. 23. The offender was arrested at about 10.20 that morning. On 1 April 2009 he pleaded guilty to these offences at the Gosford Local Court and it is upon that committal he ultimately appeared before me. He has remained in custody since his arrest on 27 September 2008.24. The accused’s evidence is that this offending conduct occurred three weeks after he and his former partner had split (transcript p 20). It would seem they had separated earlier but were still on terms that allowed for contact visits with the children and overnight stays with the partner. For some reason that had ceased three weeks before these offences. Objective Criminality25. From the facts as he finds them to be a sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of an offender. The judge does that by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the cases before him with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of these offences is evaluated. Objective criminality is a main factor in the overall sentencing outcome. A useful starting point in the assessment of objective criminality in sexual assault cases is to remind the court of part of a judgment of Mahoney JA. His Honour said: 
     
      
      “As I have indicated every offence of this kind is a serious offence, but those whose duty it is to deal with crimes of this kind and to sentence those who commit them know that though each case is inherently serious some are more serious than others. In some cases the degree of violence, physical hurt inflicted, the form of forced intercourse and the circumstances of humiliation and otherwise are much greater than are involved [in other cases]. It is to be understood that in sentencing it is appropriate, indeed in most cases it is necessary, that the sentencing judge form and record his assessment of where on the relevant scale of seriousness the particular offence lies. (See 
       R v Gebrail 
       unreported NSWCCA 18/Nov (1994)).” 
       
      
    26. In 1993 the then Chief Justice made the point that non-consensual intercourse is an extreme form of violence and one which the community expects courts to take seriously, (see R v Hartikainen unreported NSWCCA 8 June 1993). Even if no additional violence is administered other than the intercourse itself, (see R v Pay (1999) NSWCCA 40 [7]). Unwanted forced intrusion into the privacy, indeed intimacy, of a complainant’s body and psyche against her will by use of physical power and callous disregard for her wishes or feelings marks the essence of the criminality of these offences.27. The objective criminality of the offences requires consideration of the means by which it took the aggravated form. The Crown relies upon the aggravating circumstances arising from the use of “weapons”, namely petrol, scissors and knife. I have taken the petrol to embrace also the use of the lighter fluid. I note the scissors were not used to deliver any direct physical threat but rather to cut the complainant’s clothing from her and to accompany the menace of his words spoken at the time. 28. I have no doubt their use in the circumstances added seriously to the psychological fear she was then experiencing, exacerbated, no doubt, by his verbal threats to kill and his demands she would have family with no one else. Her being completely naked in the garage, in the circumstances she was in, was a humiliation of her by the offender. His flicking petrol upon her was sadistic, psychological torment. Such petrol that landed upon her may well have irritated her skin. The menace was contained in her knowledge that the petrol was inflammable. The action of flicking it and the menace were emphasised by his words, “If I can’t have the children no one can.” His spraying of lighter fluid and menacing again with the cigarette lighter was again a psychological torment designed to humiliate, crush and enforce his domination over her. 29. This psychological terror was elevated to yet a higher plane when he grabbed the knife, brought it to her face so that it touched her left eye. Her level of fear at this point was apparently so extreme she was unable to comprehend all that he was saying. She did hear enough to understand he did not want anyone playing father to her children and that she had better not be having sex with anyone else. Both of those comments display what I call a proprietal ownership they’re about where the accused was coming from. Frankly, he owns no one other than himself, as do we all. Demands such as those, as I say, expressed a notion, long gone from our cultural and his, that women are property. 30. The period of psychological standover by him was sustained and culminated in sexual assaults. I have concerned myself with whether the psychological menace engaged in with a naked lady constituted some bizarre form of sexual foreplay by him, using his physical and psychological dominance over her, enjoying some humiliation to sexually titillate himself. If it were so I would regard it as an aggravating feature. Frankly, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that it is so. I am satisfied these threats were made for the purpose of scaring the complainant into compliance, but there was no intention to carry any of them out.31. I am satisfied the offence occurred in circumstances where the offender’s judgment was impaired and his normal inhibition levels were lowered as a consequence of his ingestion of alcohol and amphetamines, at least so far as the offences conducted in the garage. There is no evidence suggesting ingestion of either alcohol or drugs whilst at the complainant’s premises. In those circumstances the effects of the drugs and alcohol must have begun to dissipate as the time wore on. I note of course that the level of psychological torment also diminished once the offender was in the house. 32. The offender claimed to “have no control over my actions”. I suspect he is confusing loss of memory for his action with absence of control. When challenged on some of those matters that he could not remember, he readily agreed, to his credit, that he was doing those things to her. I have sentenced on the basis of impeded judgment and lower inhibition, but otherwise control over decision making and choice of actions to be pursued.33. I have no doubt an issue fermenting in TS’s mind at the time of his conduct was his difficulty in accepting the relationship with the complainant was at an end. That clearly comes out in the dialogue of what he is saying to the complainant. I accept termination of the relationship caused him real emotional toil, which may have exaggerated itself as a consequence of his consumption of alcohol and amphetamine. 34. I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender intended to sexually assault the complainant when he attended, or even when he went to the garage. That is not to say that he arrived there without any hope of having consensual intercourse. Again, in respect of that I know neither one way or the other. Even so, all women should be able to end a relationship with any partner confident their personal safety is secure and they will be treated with appropriate civility. 35. This offending conduct shows a gross lack of respect for the person of his former partner and the mother of his children. It also shows a complete focus upon his own desires at the cost of her privacy, physical and psychological wellbeing. I am not entirely sure that jealousy, which was the offender’s word for it, accurately describes his feelings. There is no evidence or comment about any other suitor. It is likely feelings of rejection, possibly inadequacy, impotency and personal vulnerability were what was driving his anger.36. The facts already establish the intercourse was without protection. Given the change to circumstances between the offender and his partner, by which I mean the final separation, that exposed her to a risk of pregnancy that would most likely have been an unwanted pregnancy. 37. Of the two aggravated sexual assaults I regard the second as the more serious. It occurs in circumstances where the complainant has been subjected to an extended period of humiliating, demeaning and psychologically terrifying conduct and has already experienced the intrusion and indignity of the earlier fellatio sexual assault. 38. There is no sense of any planning. The offences are opportunistic. The complainant knew her attacker, which I sense may have been less traumatic than dealing with a total stranger making the very same demands. The offence was committed in her home, a place where he was a guest, albeit a familiar one. Nonetheless, she is entitled to the safety of her home which this conduct denied her. That the offence occurred in her home is an aggravating feature of it. The level of sexual violence was increased by the use of physical force to overpower her by holding her during the fellatio when she sought to push away. In the second instance intercourse persisted, notwithstanding her distress and requests that it cease. During the course of that a threat to kill her was added. 39. I am satisfied in respect of four out of the five cases of intercourse I am considering the offender knew the complainant was not consenting. In the offence of fellatio in the loungeroom I regard him as reckless as to whether she was consenting or not. I have earlier noted each of the sexual assaults constitutes a physical dominance by abuse of physical strength of the male over the female. While the level of violence I have tabulated does not fall into the extreme, taken with the earlier conduct in the garage, the offence occurring in her home, and the state of the victim by the time the second offence occurred, I find it falls within the midrange of seriousness, slightly below the midpoint of that range. 40. Although the offender’s entry into the home has an air of home invasion about it I have already noted I cannot be satisfied that he entered the home with the intent of sexual dominance. The assessment of the second offence falling in the midrange is exclusive of any consideration of the Form 1 matters and their impact upon sentencing. In any event, the Form 1 matters are to be taken into account in the first offence. I should note that, standing alone, I do not regard that first offence as falling into the mid-range of seriousness. Clearly, it is sufficiently serious as to be nudging a mid-range, but it does not do so. 41. Imprisonment is a sentence of last resort. Even so, given the seriousness of each of these sexual assaults, a significant term of imprisonment must be imposed for both of the indicted offences. The offender unlawfully set fire to the complainant’s property on two occasions. It is only the second occasion that is the subject of the charge. While it is not entirely clear, I have assumed from the language of the facts that it is the second fire which is the subject of that charge. That does not mean I do not take into account, in assessing the criminality of that charge, the earlier fire.Subjective MattersFamily Background and Relationships42. TS is a single father of three, aged between eight years and four years. He is an Aboriginal man, whose tribe originally came from the far north west of New South Wales. Now many of his relatives live on the Central Coast. He is the second eldest of nine siblings. He lived for the majority of his life on the Central Coast in New South Wales in a stable family environment. He still enjoys good relationships with his siblings. His mother reports the father as being extremely violent, predominantly towards her. As far as is reported, TS himself does not appear to have been a primary victim of the father’s violence. As I said at the beginning, it is likely, though, he is a secondary victim, witnessing the assaults upon his mother, and the violent behaviour of a senior male in the family as a standard expression of displeasure. His parents separated around 2001. The offender’s last contact with the father was more than eighteen months ago.43. From the age of seventeen, he spent three or four years living with his paternal grandparents, who, he says, still support him. There is evidence that the grandfather had been in court on three earlier occasions when this matter was before the court. My understanding is he lives in Gosford and would not be expected to attend court in Sydney.44. TS’s relationship with the complainant was long-standing - eleven years. It is now at an end. As earlier noted, that had occurred about three weeks before the charges I am dealing with occurred.45. There is a fourth and eldest child to an earlier relationship, although the level of contact, if any, with that child, is unknown to me. Education, Employment and Skills46. TS finished school after obtaining the School Certificate. He began working almost immediately in various short-term employment positions, mainly labouring. In 2006, he completed a Certificate III in roofing. That was a five-day weekly course that ran for twenty-seven weeks. He put his attendance at 80 per cent. There were some twenty-two topics covered. For the past eight years he has worked as a roof-tiler, most, if not all, of that time with the same employer, Tyrone Drady, who spoke of the offender as good, reliable, skilled, and capable of working unsupervised. Mr Drady graded him as “my best boy”. He indicated that he “will have steady work for TS in the future”.General Health47. So far as one can tell from his physical appearance, TS appears to be in excellent physical health. There is certainly nothing before me that indicates his physical health may cause difficulties with his rehabilitation.Mental Health48. There is no mental health profile of the offender before the court. I have assumed there is nothing in him that presents to the defence team or the Probation and Parole Officer any issue calling for such a profile. Again, I do not regard his mental health as a factor that will disadvantage his capacity to rehabilitate.Alcohol and Drugs49. His drug and alcohol abuse began at the age of fourteen by his smoking three to four cones daily. At twenty-nine, that had escalated to thirty to forty cones daily. The heavy use of cannabis is well-linked to aggression, paranoia and..(fault in recording equipment) [mental health problems (?)]..It is, for that reason, a very sinister drug. Users, including many in Aboriginal communities, smoke it for relaxation, but its effects gradually build up so that anger and aggression are the more readily triggered as a response to conduct of others, including, as in this case, the innocent and legitimate conduct of others.50. TS also abused ecstasy and speed every second or third day. Speed also has links to anger and aggression. Speed’s link to anger and aggression is also well-documented. Prior to, and at the time of, these charges he was drinking up to ten stubbies of beer or pre-mixed spirits every couple of days. All of these levels of consumption, but particularly the cannabis and speed, amount to instances of serious drug and alcohol abuse - abuse because they were dangerous to his health. Whilst in custody, the offender did an alcohol and drug programme but, at the time of the evidence, that had not been completed, he says on account of his being moved to Long Bay. 51. As will be noted later, he has been in custody since 28 September 2008. It does not seem he placed the drug and alcohol programme on his high priority list, but nonetheless, I should note it does suggest an awareness of him that his drug abuse exists and he needs to deal with it. He noted in evidence his addiction was serious - indeed, he relied upon the seriousness of the addiction to minimise his breach of the good behaviour bond. To his credit, he has also done an anger management course. Whether that course links up at all with the cannabis and amphetamine consumption as a source of anger and aggression is something I do not know and was not explored in evidence.Character and Criminal History52. As I have noted elsewhere, there is a tremendous difference between the presentation of TS sober and contrite and his presentation on the morning of 27 September, inebriated, rejected, psychologically cruel, and physically violent. By contrast, in court, he sought to accept responsibility for his acts. He presented as genuinely and profoundly remorseful. He has, with his work, displayed a good work ethic, and I have no doubt good work skills. He has long been in trouble with the law, but it must be noted never before for violence, whether physical or sexual, nor has he been convicted of arson previously. Much of his offending relates to drug offences, including illegal use of conveyances, drug offences, break and enter, and larceny offences. 53. He appeared before the Children’s Court on four occasions. On what appears to be his most serious offence, he was ordered to pay compensation of $1,946. He says he has been in juvenile custody on one prior occasion, but it would appear from the record before me that that must have been a remand custody and not sentence custody. His first adult court matter occurs in August 2000, where he was convicted in his absence of a break and enter and steal offence, and given a Community Service Order, which he subsequently breached. On that occasion, there were also driving offences. In November 2000, convicted in his absence of a larceny, compensation of $800 was ordered. There was further offending in September 2004, again driving offences. In February 2008, there were further driving offences. In respect of the driving without licence offence, the Local Court magistrate imposed an eighteen month s 9 bond. As noted in the evidence, these offences occur nearly eight months after the imposition of that bond. The penalty for each offence I am dealing with, therefore, is aggravated by virtue of the breach of the bond. It can be noted, as I earlier have said, the bond was not given for any offence related to violence or property damage.Attitude to Offence 54. The offender told the Probation and Parole officer he was devastated by what had happened, sorry for the pain he caused to the complainant, that he had never done anything like this before, and was unhappy with what he had done. When taken to that passage in the Probation and Parole Report by his counsel, he said it remained his strongest feeling. 55. At the hearing, the complainant was present. He sought permission to apologise directly to her. He told her: 
     
      
      “There’s my deepest strongest feelings that I am deeply sorry for what I have done and feel the deepest feelings of remorse for the pain I have caused you and your family. There’s nothing that words could express of how much pain I feel for myself and for yourself and our children and your immediate family. Please forgive me. Hopefully, one day you may be able to understand that I didn't have the greatest control of my actions and am no longer that person, and with the help of the good Lord I will be able to cure myself of this.”  
       
      
    56. I am confident his remorse is genuine and profound. I suspect that his conduct, particularly in the garage, was so dis-inhibited that it has caused him concern about his capacity to control his response to his emotions. Custody57. I have noted now for the third time he has been in custody since 27 September 2008. His sentence will date from that date.Plea58. He pleaded guilty before the Local Court. It was an early acknowledgment of guilt. I am also satisfied, by accepting all allegations of fact made against him, even in circumstances where he cannot remember, he has sought to minimise further trauma to the complainant that his acts caused to her. Rehabilitation Prospects59. In many sexual assault cases, the court is favoured with a professional assessment of the forensic psychological services of the Department of Corrective Services. On this occasion, no such report is before the court. Doing the best I can, I would regard the rehabilitation prognosis as positive. There are a number of favourable indicators:  
     
     ·  
      Good family support; 
      
     ·  
      Good work ethic, and employment path available upon release; 
      
     ·  
      A willingness to participate in a sexual offender’s programme conducted within the prison 
      
     ·  
      No prior history of violence or arson; and 
      
     ·  
      In particular, no prior domestic violence matters. 
      
     ·  
      High level of Contrition 
      
     ·  
      Participation in anger management and drug programmes. 
    60. The identified contributors to his criminal offending made by Probation and Parole were his emotional reaction to the separation and his use of alcohol and drugs. To those, I would add the impact upon him of his father’s violence towards the mother; that is that he has learnt that behaviour. The father was able to remain within the family showing violence towards his partner for two decades. Each of those three areas needs to be addressed. What link, if any, between the drugs and alcohol abuse and the history of the violence upon his ex-partner should be explored? Counselling may be useful in respect of dealing with serious emotional upset and past closeness to domestic violence. I would also recommend to the Parole Board that they require of him, as a condition of parole, that he complete a full-time [drug] rehabilitation programme at a culturally appropriate clinic, which enforces a proper urine analysis screening programme. I have found special circumstances upon an assumption that such a condition will be ordered or agreed to.Setting the Sentence Deterrence61. Clearly, both general and personal deterrence are to be given full weight in the sentencing outcome.Standard Non-Parole Considerations62. The two sexual assault offences to which the offender pleaded guilty would carry a standard non-parole if the objective criminality of the offences fell within a mid-range of seriousness. The three sexual assault offences taken into account on a Form 1 do not carry any standard non-parole period once they are consigned to a Form 1. The approach to taking offences into account were set out in the judgment of Speigleman CJ in The Attorney General Application under S 37 Crimes (Sentence Procedure Act) 1999 (2004) 61 NSWLR 38. It is important to note these three offences in the Form 1 are not in for sentence by virtue of s 54B(1). The standard non-parole period does not attach to them. In respect of the two indicted aggravated sexual assaults, the standard non-parole period is ten years imprisonment.63. The court is required to set a standard non-parole period unless it determines that there are reasons for setting a greater or lesser standard non-parole. The reasons for which a court may set a standard non-parole period greater or lesser than the standard non-parole period are only those referred to in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Where the Court sets a standard non-parole period greater or lesser than the standard non-parole period, it must identify each factor that it took into account for that increase or reduction. The areas from which s 21A appears to permit matters of aggravation or mitigation to emerge appear to be four in number: 
     
     ·  
      Aggravating factors found in a check list contained in s 21A(2). 
      
     ·  
      Mitigating factors found in a check list contained in s 21A(3). 
      
     ·  
      Other objective or subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offence identified by the sentencing judge. 
      
     ·  
      Other matters that are required to be taken into account under any Act or rule of law. 
     64. Aggravating factors revealed by s 21A(2) include that the offence was committed in the home of the victim. I have already taken that matter into account in assessing the objective criminality. The offence involved gratuitous cruelty. Again I have already taken that into account, the psychological terror, when assessing the objective criminality. It may be that s 21A(2)(j) applies in regard to this offender. I have already referred to the bond to be of good behaviour that was breached. I do not regard it as likely in the circumstances of that case before the magistrate that a custodial sentence was likely, that is to say that his liberty was conditional, but his liberty was in a sense conditional, because in the event of a breach, theoretically at least, he stood liable to be sentenced to imprisonment. But it is hard to see that he would have been if the rules of law had been properly applied. In any event, I have already taken the matter into account. I have taken into account the offence was committed against his ex-partner and mother of three children. I have not described that as a position of trust. It was a position in which he owed respect, and that finding is implicit in my regard. I do not regard him as having breached, nor have I been requested to regard him as having breached a position of trust.65. I regard each offence separately when considering the objective seriousness of each. I have taken into account the various non-sexual assaults upon the complainant when determining the objective seriousness of each offence. I have also taken into account in aggravating the criminality of the second sexual assault offence, that the complainant had previously been assaulted as part of the relevant background. But I note that the first sexual assault was not considered as otherwise part of the seriousness of this offence.66. As to mitigating factors set out in s 21A(3), I have already taken into account the offence was not planned, that his rehabilitation indicators are more positive than negative, his sincere contrition, his acceptance and full responsibility for his actions, even in circumstances where he cannot remember all of them, his acknowledgement of the hurt and pain he has caused the complainant, her family and children, his plea of guilty.67. I do not regard the aggravating features as requiring me to consider a longer than prescribed standard non-parole period. I regard the mitigating factors I have identified as permitting and requiring a shorter than the prescribed standard non-parole period; see R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168. Special circumstances68. The Crown has not sought to argue against a finding of special circumstances. This offender has never been a sentenced prisoner in adult custody previously. It is also likely he was not a sentenced inmate in juvenile custody. His acts have seen him separated from his children by the gaol gate. Such custody will be more arduous for him than for those prisoners whose children visit regularly. His rehabilitation has greater chances of being fostered in the community than behind gaol walls. These are all reasons why special circumstances should be found and I intend to do so.Setting the sentence69. The JIRS statistics for offenders sentenced to s 61J offences shows a range of sentences falling between two years and sixteen years with peaks ranging between six years and ten years. Thirty-five per cent of offenders received a head sentence of nine years or more. Thirty-eight per cent of offenders received head sentences of six years or less. For those with multiple offences the range narrows from three to sixteen years with peaks still between six and ten years imprisonment. Thirty-nine per cent of prisoners received the sentence of nine or more years and sixty-five per cent of offenders fall between six and ten years. 70. These figures suggest there is a vast range of factual matrix constituting an offence of aggravated sexual assault, and that by virtue of the nature of the offending in the vast bulk of cases substantial sentences are called for. I should note the maximum penalty for the indicted aggravated sexual assault offences is twenty years imprisonment. I have mentioned the standard non-parole period of ten years. 71. Although as I have explained it is open to a judge in certain circumstances to set a lesser non-parole period than the standard, the standard non-parole period must nonetheless still impact upward upon the final decision made by the judge.72. The sexual assault offences on the Form 1 carry a maximum penalty on indictment of fourteen years. If on indictment they also carry a standard non-parole period of seven years. The malicious damage of property by fire carries a maximum penalty of ten years imprisonment. 73. For reasons I have given, I regard the second offence as more serious. I have determined that a starting figure of ten years is called for. In selecting that figure I have taken into account the existence of the standard non-parole period and the related intent of parliament, the sentences for these offences are relatively higher now than they previously were. By virtue of the plea of guilty I have discounted that figure by twenty-five per cent, now giving an overall sentence of seven and a half years. 74. The first offence, although not more serious standing alone, has the three further offences of sexual intercourse without consent to be taken into account on the Form One. While I have regarded it as falling below the mid range of objective seriousness, the impact of the three sexual assault offences also drives that sentence upwards. I have given it a starting point of nine and a half years. Again that is discounted by twenty-five per cent, yielding an overall sentence of seven years, one and a half months.75. The third indicted charge is malicious damage to property by fire. In the scheme of offences that does not reach the level of seriousness of any other offence. Standing alone it would be dealt with in the Local Court by way of a non-custody option. I have imposed a six month concurrent sentence for it. Concurrent Sentences76. All of these offences occurred within, at the very most, a ten hour period, in fact at the very most a seven hour period. My own view is they are likely to have occurred within a three or four hour period. I have determined that each sentence should be concurrent. On that basis they form part of an ongoing course of criminal conduct. I have necessarily fixed an overall sentence that reflects the totality of criminality.Sentencing77. TS, I convict you that you on 27 September 2008 at Umina did have sexual intercourse with RJ without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting to the sexual intercourse, in circumstances of aggravation, namely at the time you threatened to inflict actual bodily harm upon her by means of an offensive weapon, namely the knife, the scissors and the use of petrol. For that offence I sentence you to a non-parole period of three years and nine months to commence on 27 September 2008 and to expire on 26 June 2012. There is a balance of term to expire on 11 November 2015. 78. For the second offence, which is, as I said, the main one, it is an offence in exactly the same terms but it relates to the penile vaginal intercourse in the garage, you are convicted. For that you are sentenced to a non-parole period of four years to commence on 27 September 2008 and to expire on 26 September 2012. The balance of term will expire on 26 March 2016. 79. In respect of the intentionally or recklessly destroy by means of fire certain property, to wit personal papers, they appear to be included here in the indictment, clothing, the property of RJ, nonetheless I still sentence you for six months. That sentence will commence on 27 June 2008 (as said) and it expired on 26 March 2009. It has already been served.80. I should tell you this, when I sentence someone for less than three years I can order them to be released to parole. In your case I cannot order you to be released to parole on the 27 September 2012. That is your earliest release date. You have to persuade the Parole Board that you will be eligible for release on that date, and frankly they will be reluctant to release you, I can tell you this, if you do not do those sexual assault offence courses and if you get into any trouble while in gaol. If you do get to do those courses, I cannot see any reason why you should not be released on that date. BHAT: Your Honour, in relation to the penalty for malicious damage charge, your Honour indicated that that sentence was to commence from 27 June.HIS HONOUR: I thought I said 27 September. Did I say June?BHAT: Yes.HIS HONOUR: I should have said September - 27 September 2008 and to expire on 26 March. If there is any error I will fix it.

    JUDGMENT 1. Lazeros Haralabidis and Timotheos Petropoulos are both well presented young men who had never been in trouble with the law before 5 April 2008. On 16 September 2009 at Parramatta District Court each was indicted on charges relating to the sexual assault of one DV, a seventeen year old girl on 5 April 2008. Haralabidis was indicted upon thirteen charges. His friend Petropoulos was indicted upon nine charges. Those nine charges were said to be offences committed in circumstances where Petropoulos and Haralabidis were pursing a common purpose; to have three way sexual intercourse with DV.2. The trial of the issues arising out of the various charges lasted a month. On 16 October 2009 the Parramatta jury found both accused guilty of the nine charges of aggravated sexual assault; the circumstance of aggravation being that each was in the company of the other. Haralabidis was also found guilty of having unlawful sexual intercourse with DV (count 4). He was found not guilty of the other matters he had been indicted upon. Today each young man is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct at Beaman Park on the night of 5 April 2008.3. As the sentencing judge, it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentences for these offences before this Court, committed these offenders, harming this victim in this community; Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1SCR 688 [80]. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the Court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal and subjective to each of the offenders. The starting point for these assessments requires me to make findings of fact from the evidence before the jury and sentencing evidence before the Court relating to the offence and to the offender.4. Each offenders’ rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking through a glass darkly.5. Before any sentence can be made, there are likely to be technical questions relating to whether any of these offences attracts a standard non-parole period and if so, the length of the parole period that will finally be allocated and ultimately the term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed for these offences. None of those things can be done until the primary facts have been established. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against an imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus; the protection of the community will also need to be determined; see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.6. Each having been found guilty by a jury, it falls to me to determine the facts that stand against each for sentence. The facts as I find them to be must reflect the jury’s verdict and the path taken by the jury to reach that verdict. In forming my view of the facts, I am not bound to find facts at the extreme end of favourability or un-favourability to any party in this litigation. The Crown submitted that given the verdict, wherever facts were in contest between the accused on the one hand and the Crown on the other, I should reject the accuseds’ version. A global statement such as that cannot be right. Should the contest relate to proof of an essential element, those facts which are central to the proof of that element, whatever their source, may be accepted as supporting the jury verdict.7. It is likely most of those facts will be found in the Crown case. But there are other facts not necessarily essential to the proof of an essential element where the proposition advanced by the Crown can have no great strength.The Facts8. The Crown has attached to his submissions a document entitled “prosecution summary of facts proved at trial”. My fact finding has relied extensively, but by no means exclusively upon that document. Neither accused's counsel argued that the document was inaccurate or lacked objectivity. I am satisfied that what I have drawn from it properly and fairly puts the facts on sentence for both accused.9. In March 2008 the complainant, DB (DOB 1991) while on the MySpace Website on her family’s computer came across an image of Haralabidis. She liked it and included him as one of her contacts. An email was automatically sent to his email address. He replied to her using the MSN site which allowed for instant messaging. They began communicating with each other. Thereafter the two had almost daily half hour contact.10. About a week before the offences they exchanged phone numbers. From 29 March 2008 they began having frequent telephone contact, including late night calls. They discussed meeting in person. After one failed attempt, Haralabidis persuaded her to meet with him. On 5 April they agreed to meet. She told her mother she was going out to the city to visit friends from school. They agreed to meet in a park at Croydon; the suburb in which she lived. About 7.30pm she left her home, walking to Croydon Park. The accused arrived there about 7.45 and they met in person for the first time.11. Petropoulos was also present in a small hatchback he had driven Haralabidis to the park. She approached Haralabidis, who by this time was out of the car. They both said hello. She saw Petropoulos in the car and asked who he was. Haralabidis said, “He’s just a mate. I couldn’t drive. I had to get someone to drive me”. He did not have a license.12. When they first met, he greeted her with a kiss on the cheek. She thought nothing of it. She entered into the car and sat in the rear seat. Petropoulos then drove all of them to Beaman Park at Earlwood. She was told they were going to a park. She asked what they would be doing. Haralabidis said they were just going to hang out.13. They arrived at the park. There were no other cars or people there. Lighting was few in the park. There were several areas of darkness. The two offenders alighted from the car. Initially she remained within the car. Haralabidis asked her to come out. She said “No, it was a bit cold.” This was a response she made because she was not keen to leave the car. Haralabidis persisted “No, no come out.” He pushed the front seat forward.14. She alighted from the vehicle and sat on a little paved area near a fence. He sat next to her and asked if he looked like his picture. She said, “yes"". He came close and tried to kiss her, but she moved her face to the side. Haralabidis left to talk to Petropoulos. He returned and said to the complainant “Lets go for a walk.” She followed him into the park, some fifty metres to a secluded area bound by a graffiti covered wall.15. Four metres or so from the wall Haralabidis started kissing her. She returned the kiss for a few seconds and then stopped. Haralabidis moved his arm around her waist and walked her towards the wall. He sat with his back against the wall. He had a hand on her ankle and told her to sit down on him. She stood there. He repeated said to sit down on him using a stricter or stronger tone, as she thought. She sat on him because she was scared.16. Haralabidis went directly to the topic, “What colour underwear are you wearing?” She said “Just underwear.” He put his hand into her pants, pulled up part of her underwear and said “Oh pink. I was hoping you were wearing red.” He said “You’re wearing shorts. You should have worn a skirt. Take it off.” She did not respond. In a stronger voice he said “Take it off.” Scared, she did as she was asked and took her shorts off. Again he said “Take it off,” referring to her underwear. Again she did as she was told. He told her to sit back on him. She did. She was very scared.Count 417. While sitting on him, he asked her to have sex. She said “No, I don’t. I don’t want to get pregnant.” He said, “Don’t worry, I’ll pull out five minutes before I blow.” She said, “No. I don’t want to risk it.” Haralabidis put his arms around her waist and moved her forward so she was directly sitting on him. She was straddled over him. His penis, which was exposed, he put partially into her vagina for about a minute. She was not consenting. She moved, trying to move back. He was holding her waist preventing this. She persisted and was able to move away a short distance while still sitting upon him.18. At this point she turned and saw a person some ten metres or so away on her left. “Who’s the person?” she asked. The person moved away. She turned and next saw Petropoulos, who I hasten to add was not the person she had first seen, standing about ten metres away. She said to Haralabidis, “What’s he doing there?” Haralabidis did not respond. Petropoulos walked up to them. She was still straddled over Haralabidis’ thighs. One of the men said, “Do you want to have some fun?” She said “What do you mean?” The reply was “Having threesome.” Her response was “No, I am not comfortable with a three way.” There was no response from either accused.19. Petropoulos, although not invited so to do, sat down. He leaned over, kissed the complainant for a couple of seconds. It was an unwelcome act. She moved away. She was still sitting on Haralabidis and still naked below the waist.20. She attempted to cover herself by pulling her top down. Petropoulos told her not to be embarrassed. He said, “If you’re uncomfortable, I can leave.” She replied, “Yes, I’m uncomfortable.” He said, “So I should leave.” Haralabidis interrupted, “No, stay.” The complainant felt intimidated by the presence of the two men. Petropoulos said, “Okay, how we going to do this?” He placed his hooded jacket on the ground and said, “This is for you so you don’t get dirty. You go down on him,” pointing to Haralabidis, “and I’ll do you from behind.” She said “What? Out here?” Petropoulos said, “Okay fine, we'll go in the car.”21. They returned to the car, she reluctantly, not wanting or looking forward to any proposed sexual encounter. She was still naked from the waist down, scared of what the offenders might do to her. Petropoulos opened the car door, pushed down the seats. She said, “I do not want to have sex.” The accused entered the car. One of them had nudged her to go into the car. Petropoulos sat in the middle of the rear seat. She was sitting on her knees on the reclined seat. Haralabidis was between the passenger seat and the dashboard. He closed the door. She said for a second time to the accused, “I do not want to have sex.” Neither said anything.22. She was in a quandary. A number of thoughts ran through her mind; a number of thoughts of escaping also ran through her mind. Ultimately she did not think that would be a good idea.Count 5: Sexual Assault in company; digital penetration by Haralabidis, Count 6: Sexual Assault in Company, Oral Sex on Petropoulos; and Count 7: Sexual Assault in Company, Anal Intercourse by Haralabidis23. Petropoulos took off his pants and told her to go down on him. She performed oral sex on Petropoulos and as she did so, Haralabidis was separating her buttock cheeks with his hand. He placed a finger into her vagina. While doing this he also placed his penis into her anus.24. Meanwhile Petropoulos, whose penis was not yet erect, said to her “come on, get it up”. The complainant gave him oral intercourse and his penis became erect.25. The anal intercourse by Haralabidis was for a short time. It hurt the complainant. Haralabidis’ action in placing his penis (as said, read ""finger"") into the vagina also hurt. Haralabidis commented about the complainant being “too small”. The two offenders agreed to swap positions.26. During the incident the complainant told the offenders she had to go home soon. Haralabidis asked what time she had to be home. She said she had to be home at 9.30. One of the offenders said, “Okay, we’ll be quick.” Whether it was the same offender or not is unclear, but one said, “If you’re not home by that time will your Dad call you.” She said, “Yes.”26. The two offenders swapped positions. Petropoulos now in the front seat area behind her asked had she ever had anal sex. She said, “No”. He said “Would you like to try it?” Her reply was, “Not really.”Count 8: Sexual Assault in Company, Oral Intercourse on Haralabidis; Count 9: Sexual Assault in Company, Fingers into Vagina by Petropoulos; Count 10: Sexual Assault in Company, Anal Intercourse by Petropoulos27. Haralabidis told her to go down on him. She said “I don’t want to. You've just put that in my butt.” Haralabidis replied, “It doesn’t matter. Do it.” She started to perform oral sex upon him. As she did, Petropoulos separated her buttock cheeks with his hands, put a finger or fingers into her vagina and about the same time inserted his penis into her anus.28. The intrusion of an adult penis into her anus caused great pain. It felt to her as if her skin was about to rip.Count 11: Anal Intercourse by Petropoulos29. Petropoulos said it would be better for him if she sat on him. She stopped giving oral sex to Haralabidis. Petropoulos moved to a seated position, withdrawing his penis as he did so. He was still on the front passenger seat. He placed his hands now upon her waist and brought her closer to him until his penis was again inserted into her anus. The degree of penetration was less deep than previously, but still caused discomfort.Count 12: Anal Intercourse by Petropoulos30. Petropoulos withdrew his penis and moved back to a standing type position. At this time Haralabidis said, “Just fuck her. It’s easier.” She turned around and said “No.” Petropoulos again placed his penis in her anus, again causing discomfort.Count 13: Oral Intercourse on Haralabidis31. Once Petropoulos had resumed the standing position, as it were, and the complainant was facing Haralabidis, he told her to continue giving him oral sex. She gave him oral sex for a few seconds and stopped. He said, “Keep going.” He held the back of her head and brought it forward toward his penis. She continued to give him oral intercourse. At one point he said, “Lick my balls.” She did so.32. Petropoulos then asked if he could ejaculate on her back. She stopped giving Haralabidis oral intercourse and asked why. Petropoulos said it sets him off. He proceeded to ejaculate on her lower back. When that was completed he exited the vehicle. She wiped her back, as I understand it on his T-shirt.33. Haralabidis wanted to continue oral intercourse. He said he was about to come. He ejaculated into her mouth. She opened the door of the vehicle and spat his ejaculate on the ground.34. Petropoulos began to laugh, saying “I’m sorry, that’s just the funniest thing I’ve ever seen”. He then handed her a t-shirt saying she could wipe herself. She used that t-shirt to wipe herself. She reclothed herself with her underwear and shorts.35. Haralabidis exited the car. The two males had a cigarette. She returned to the car. During the criminal conduct in the car, Haralabidis switched the inside light on a couple of times. Each time the complainant asked for it to be switched off. Petropoulos also switched the light on. Again she asked for it to be switched off. He asked why. She replied, “I don’t want you looking at me.” Haralabidis joined the conversation “Why? It’s a good arse.” The light was turned on during the period each offender had his penis in her anus. Unknown to the complainant, Petropoulos used his mobile phone to film his penetration of her from two different positions, including when he was in the seated position.36. During her time in the car there was some touching of her breasts, but not for any extended period.37. After the offences were then committed, she was taken at her request to Ashfield Railway Station; a five or ten minute drive from Beaman Park. She telephoned her mother about 9.10, who arrived shortly after and returned the complainant to her home.38. There was a subsequent contact by Haralabidis to her while she was on the MSN Website. That contact occurred sometime during the day following. He messaged her saying, “Oi, why are you being a snob for?” She replied, “I’m not.” His message, “Do you want me to talk to you?” Her message, “No I don't. I don’t want to talk to you.” His message, “Can I ask why?” Her message, “Because of last night. You knew I didn’t want to do anything.” His message, “Okay, sorry.” Her message, “I’m thinking of going to the police.” His message, “I’m warning you, don’t do anything stupid.” Her message, “Or else what?” His message, “Are you being serious?” Her message, “Yes.” His message, “I’m warning you, don’t do anything. I wouldn’t do anything stupid.”39. Both accused were arrested on 10 April 2008. Initially Haralabidis was not given bail or not able to make it and spent five days in custody. During his arrest Haralabidis was interviewed by police over a number of hours. He denied the offences initially and ultimately admitted to consensual touching and oral intercourse in the car. He denied anal, penile or finger penetration occurred.Objective Criminality40. From the facts as he finds them to be, a sentencing judge is required to assess what is called the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of an offender. That is a fairly technical exercise by the judge, and you can be sure that those who are looking after your interests will check to see that the assessment is properly done. What is sought to be done is to compare objectively the criminality exhibited in the charges before me with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that was is called the objective seriousness of the criminality in these matters can be assessed or evaluated. That important criminality has an important, indeed the main impact upon the over all sentencing outcome.41. A useful starting point in the assessment of objective criminality in sexual assault cases is to remind the court of part of a judgment of one of the great judges of appeal in New South Wales, Mahoney J.A. He said in this particular judgment,  
     
      
      “As I have indicated, every offence of this kind is a serious offence, but those whose duty it is to deal with crimes of this kind, and to sentence those who commit them, know that though each case is inherently serious, some are more serious than others. In some cases the degree of violence, physical hurt inflicted, the form of forced intercourse and the circumstances of humiliation and otherwise are much greater than are involved [in other cases], It is to be understood that in sentencing, it is appropriate, indeed, in most cases it is necessary that the sentencing judge form and record his assessment of where on the relevant scale of seriousness the particular offence lies.”  
      R v Gebrail 
       unreported NSWCCA 18/Nov (1994). 
       
      
    42. The then chief justice of New South Wales made the point that non-consensual intercourse is an extreme form of violence, and one which the community expects courts to take very seriously, see R v Hartikainen unreported NSWCCA 8 June 1993, even if no additional violence is administered other than the intercourse, see R v Pay (1999) NSWCCA 40 [7]. Unwanted forced intrusion into the privacy, indeed the intimacy, of a complainant’s body and psyche, against her will by use of physical power and callous disregard of her wishes or feelings, marks the essence of the criminality of these offences.43. In this case the complainant was subjected to humiliating, demeaning and violent indignities by both men. Clearly, the sexual offending by each in the car lifts this case above the level of sexual assault cases falling towards a lower level of criminality. That each offender was in the company of the other is a circumstance of aggravation that has been made an element of the offence. But in this case, the other person in company was not only a spectator, but was himself generally a participant simultaneously. Both men were concerned primarily with their own sexual gratification, taken from some sexual bonding they were able to achieve through their mutual acts of intercourse with, and presumably humiliation of, a young woman. 44. For many of those who do not practise anal intercourse - and I am satisfied the complainant did not - there is a stigma about it. That stigma is most common among the young. That she was penetrated initially by Haralabidis in the presence of another male whom she did not know must have been crushing for her; that she was required to suck the penis that moments before had been in her anus must have been revolting beyond her worst nightmare.45. Being penetrated in two and sometimes three places in her body simultaneously was degrading of her and her womanhood. The conduct engaged in by the offenders, robbed sexual activity of any link it might have to romance, love or sharing of friendship experience with another. This was an exercise in self and male focus for these two young men. Being shuttled back and forth so that each could mutually satisfy himself by penetrating her at one while the mate penetrated her at the other, all the time unwilling, and the absence of her consent being ignored.46. While I am suspicious that both men were up to a threesome that night before they met the complainant, I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that that was so. Even if it were so, it would be impossible to go the next step and say they were going to have a three-way, whether the unknown girl consented or not. The Crown does not allege planning. I am prepared to find these offences must be considered as unplanned and opportunistic.47. There is no suggestion either accused was in any way affected by drugs or alcohol. It would seem that at the time of meeting the complainant, both men were leaving open their prospects of later going elsewhere. It would seem they did not do that, as events turned out.48. In assessing whether these offences in the motor vehicle fall within the mid range, I have determined only where the offender was the principal in the first degree that that offence is a candidate offence, one that might reach a mid range of seriousness. 49. The law has long distinguished, when measuring criminality, the criminality associated with the actual doer of an offence as usually being greater than the criminality of his accomplice. It is less frequently that the offender and accomplice are regarded as sharing equal criminality in an offence. I do not regard, for example, the last offence committed in the vehicle, that is, the fellatio upon Haralabidis as reaching a mid range of seriousness. While the jury, by its verdict, regarded Petropoulos as still being in company with and sharing a common purpose, Petropoulos’ participation on this occasion was outside the vehicle for most of that time.50. Haralabadis’s offence is not aggravated by the other offender penetrating the complainant simultaneously. Likewise I do not regard Petropoulos’ anal penetration of the complainant when in the sitting position as constituting a mid range offence for the same reason, that is, the complainant was not being penetrated simultaneously by the other offender. 51. There is a second reason for declining to regard the subsequent - that is the sitting - incident of anal intercourse as falling below the mid range. True, the penis was asserted afresh from the anal intercourse that had been going on seconds before and therefore the elements of a second offence can be proved beyond reasonable doubt, but in the circumstances of the case it was effectively a continuation of the anal intercourse charges against Petropoulos that immediately preceded it. Likewise, when he resumed the position he had initially had, that was in effect a continuation of the anal intercourse that had started by him and been interrupted by the turn around.52. When this anal intercourse by Petropoulos initially began, Haralabidis was also penetrating another part of the complainant’s body. In the course of that anal intercourse, penetrating was deep and painful for the complainant. At that time there was a third penetration by Petropoulos. The two men, in penetrating together a girl they did not know, were seeking a bond through their mutual unlawful sexual activity, callous of the complainant’s position or feeling. It should be made clear, particularly because I sense Mr Longville, counsel for Petropoulos, submits otherwise, the criminality of earlier or subsequent offending does not impact upon the seriousness of the criminality of the offence standing for consideration, other than in respect of past offending being part of the circumstances and background in which that offence occurs. Perhaps the only exception to that is when concurrent sentences are set and the doctrine of totality requires some upward adjustment.53. When determining whether an offence attracts a standard non-parole period, that decision must be formed upon an assessment of the objective criminality of the considered offence standing alone. It is also argued the complainant showed no signs of distress, by which is meant that she did not cry, scream out or cringe in fear. I accept that is so. Her evidence is she submitted, believing that to be the safest course. It must have been obvious to each of these uncaring men that they were penetrating someone who was doing no more than submitting, complying and accommodating. When she did speak it was to express a negative. 54. It was argued that the complainant’s evidence was that at some time she pretended she wanted to [have sexual intercourse]. No-one questioned her about what she meant by those words or what steps she took to pretend. The importance of the evidence was that it went to a third element the Crown needed to prove beyond reasonable doubt, namely, whether the accused knew she was not consenting. The jury, by its verdict, clearly did not give the evidence any weight the defence hoped for on account of that element. My own sense of meaning is that she pretended to be submitting by not crying out, by not screaming. I am satisfied her pretence did not rise above submission, did not give any indication, that her earlier expressed rejections were now withdrawn.55. A measure of criminality is the impact the offending conduct had upon the victim. In respect of any specific act of intercourse, I can only assess that by saying that that relevant act contributed significantly to the over all impact, but I cannot obviously quantify what impact count 8 for instance had upon her suffering.56. The complainant suffered physical pain, particularly as a consequence of the anal intercourse. Whatever physical pain was experienced, it would seem to have resolved itself with time. The real sequelae of her sexual assaults is to be found in the real, enduring and serious psychological injury done to her psyche. She experiences ongoing flashbacks and replays, nightmares, depression to the point of attempting suicide several times, insomnia, feelings of guilt and self-loathing. She has also experienced weight loss, no doubt due to the psychological factors, from forty-seven kilos down to as low as thirty-eight kilos. In more recent times she has reached forty-one kilos. She experiences anxiety and what she terms paranoia.57. The absence of consent was made plain. When the subject of the threesome was first broached at the graffiti wall, she said “No, I am not comfortable with a three-way.” On return to the car she said, “I do not want to have sex.” She was nudged to enter the car, with its seats down prepared for sex. Once sitting in the closed car before anything started she said, “I do not want to have sex.” Neither accused responded; nor did either take any notice of her third expression of a lack of consent. During the course of events, when asked by Petropoulos if she would like to try anal sex, she said, “Not really.” When told by Haralabidis to go down on his soiled penis, she said, “I don’t want to. You’ve put that in my butt.” His reply was, “It doesn’t matter, just do it.” I regard each accused of having actual knowledge of absence of consent.58. Neither accused wore a condom, the intercourse was unprotected. Victims of unwelcome, unprotected sex are invariably, rightly anxious as to the likelihood of their contacting a sexually transmitted disease. Some of those diseases are still incurable, debilitating, and in some instances can be fatal. The failure to wear a condom aggravates the criminality of the anal intercourse offences in particular. 59. With one exception I do not regard the fellatio charges - that is, the oral sex charges - as falling into the mid range. Whilst I accept they were done at a time when the complainant was being penetrated, the level of pain as distinct from degradation was not as great as occurred through the anal intercourse. The exception, however, was the instance when Haralabidis required the complainant to fellate his soiled penis.60. I regard the taking of the photographs by Petropoulos as aggravating his criminality. The photo was for his trophy cabinet; he could enjoy and sexually titillate himself with that photograph or those motions after the event. It was not enough that he demeaned her in the car; he sought to use that occasion to enjoy his demeaning of her at his leisure. 61. I do not regard the digital penetration offences of the complainant as reaching a mid range of objecting seriousness. Those offences occurred simultaneously with anal penetration. My sense of the evidence is the digital penetration did not last for long. The complainant’s evidence was that penetration hurt her, but it was not at a level as she experienced when anally penetrated.62. It is agreed the offender’s acts were not accompanied by aggravation, swearing or “demands often seen in cases of this nature”. That is so, but had that been the case, given what I have documented thus far, the case would then have reached a point above the mid range of seriousness, or at least have been considered for that. 63. Another argument advanced by the defence related to the co-operation shown by the offenders in responding to the complainant’s request for the cabin light to be turned off, each time they turned it on. A moment’s thought about the cabin light being turned on will reveal the cabin light hardly works as mitigation for the offenders’ conduct. The first time the complainant complained about the light, it was clear she was distressed by its being put on. To turn it on a second and subsequent times must have been done in the full knowledge of the distress the light had for her. Further, the purpose for the light being turned on was not so that the offenders could find something, but rather so that they could see more clearly aspects of their own conduct, and in the case of Petropoulos, catch that conduct on his mobile phone camera as a living memory of his unlawful conduct.64. I regard count 7 as reaching a mid range of seriousness as against Haralabidis. I regard count 8 as reaching a mid range of seriousness as against Haralabidis. I regard count 9 as reaching a mid range of seriousness as against Petropoulos. Each of these offences that I have just nominated is now capable of attracting a standard non-parole period of ten years.65. I return now to consider whether the objective seriousness of count 4 falls within a mid range of seriousness. That offence occurred with the complainant sitting on Haralabidis’ thighs. He asked her to have sex. She said, “No, I don’t want to get pregnant.” He said, “Don’t worry, I’ll pull out five minutes before I blow.” She persisted, “No, I don’t want to risk it.” 66. It is argued by both defence counsel that the jury probably took the view the complainant had been consenting to the earlier encounters. I make it clear I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt she never did. I am equally satisfied the jury did not regard her as so consenting. The jury was astute enough to realise, though, that the first time she communicated unequivocally her absence of consent was at the point of count 4. What follows from that is that, in respect of the first three counts the jury could not be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, Haralabidis knew she was not consenting. 67. That is not the case with count 4, nor is it a case of recklessness, as Mr Hazelwood submitted. It is a case of what part of the word “no” did Haralabidis not understand. His reaction immediate upon her second rejection was to place his hands around her waist and pull her towards his penis. He was not prepared to accept that “No” meant no to him. In the face of her rejection, he went ahead.68. This intercourse was a case of his penis partially penetrating her. Clearly, full penetration and prolonged penetration would have been of greater criminality. The act seems to have been interrupted by the presence of an unknown observer and closely followed by the presence of Petropoulos. There was no ejaculation. This offence is towards the lower levels of criminality for offences of this kind. It falls below half way towards the mid range of seriousness. It will not attract the standard non-parole period of seven years.Subjective Matters69. I turn now to the subjective factors. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence, but also I am sentencing each offender for them. Each offender coming before the court varies from others who have stood for sentence. Circumstances personal to the offender may offer to the courts some explanation, or insight into the commission of an offence by him, or some reason why a more or less sentencing outcome is appropriate. I start with Lazaros Haralabidis.Lazaros Haralabidis70. Haralabidis is an Australian born of Greek parents. He is twenty-two years of age at the time of sentence and twenty at the time of offending. He comes from strong family support. One of his parents was present each day throughout the trial. His mother gave evidence on sentence; his sister gave evidence in the trial. The parents are hard working. The father currently runs a takeaway food shop in Western Sydney. They instilled into Haralabidis a strong work ethic. Education, Employment and Skills71. Haralabidis was a below average student, his mother said. Together with his parents it was decided that he would leave school after year 10. He held a job at Coles for a few months, then took on an apprenticeship as a painter and decorator. He has not yet completed that apprenticeship, but has worked continuously in the trade until the present. Probation and Parole said it received good reports from his current employer for both work performance and work commitment.72. Probation and Parole report him as being portrayed as an average young man who enjoys sport and is active in playing football and tennis. He has computer skills, at least to the point of being able to spend a couple of hours each evening on the computer.General Health73. From his physical appearance in court he presents as a fit healthy young man. It does not appear his general health will cause him any issues in rehabilitation nor is there any evidence of alcohol or drug issues. Mental Health Issues74. There are no mental health issues that would cause problems so far as is known to his rehabilitation.75. Since being charged he is depressed, cranky and locks himself in his room on his own. His condition, if I can call it that, deteriorated during the trial. Character and Criminal Antecedents76. He told Probation and Parole he had not previously met or arranged to meet anyone other than the complainant on the basis of any Internet chat. I have already made reference to his absence of any past criminal history. 77. His family is religious. His mother says Haralabidis was taught Christian values. She regarded him as immature, naïve, but a good boy with a good heart. I am prepared, as will be seen later, to accept that description. Attitude to Offence78. There is no dispute from the accused that the individual sexual acts that were put before the jury occurred. His contention is that they were consensual. He gave to police an extensive interview, initially denying but subsequently admitting to the sexual encounters. He has much invested in the position he has taken. I do not regard him as having any insight into the gravity of his offending conduct and I do not regard him as having any empathy with the victim.Timotheos Petropoulos79. I come to Timotheos Petropoulos. He is the younger of the two by some four months. He has just turned twenty-two. He was born in Greece, the youngest of three siblings. His two older siblings are women aged 29 and 27. He comes from a close knit, law abiding family. One sister told Probation and Parole he had been brought up to be respectful of the opposite sex.Education and Employment80. Petropoulos attended Clemton Park Primary and Kingsgrove North Secondary. I think it was the fact that Haralabidis also attended Kingsgrove North, although I did not put that in my remarks. He completed his Higher School Certificate in 2005. He commenced post High School (2006) Certificate 3 in Information Technology with TAFE. The certificate is yet to be completed but a sizeable portion of it appears to have been done. His present employment is as a sales team leader; a field he has worked in since leaving school. His current wage is $1,000 net. He also has an interest in wedding video production and photography. He claims on the job training. He was intending to start his own business this year. He presents as the more urbane of the two offenders. He has a strong work ethic and would appear to have leadership qualities. General Health81. So far as one can tell from observation in court he appears fit and in good general health. There appear to be no issues with his general health so far as far as rehabilitation is concerned.Mental Health82. Again there is no evidence of any mental health issues or pathology that could impede his rehabilitation.Alcohol and Drugs83. Again there is nothing before the court raising alcohol or drug issues that would impede his rehabilitation.Attitude to the Offence84. Petropoulos continues to maintain his sexual acts were consensual. He has expressed no empathy to the victim or regrets for his conduct. As with his co-offender he has much invested in his claim of innocence. One can only conclude his priorities are such as to display poor insight into his offending behaviour and its impact upon his victim. I will come in a moment to what I mean by his priorities. Character and Criminal Record85. Petropoulos comes from a strong and healthy family background, shows good work ethic and leadership qualities. As noted earlier he too has no criminal convictions. Rehabilitation Prospects of the Offenders86. Both young men have clouded rehabilitation prospects. On the positive side both have no prior criminal history or any apparent earlier brushes with the law. Both have good work skills and work ethic, good general health, no issues with drug and alcohol, no mental health issues. Both have good family support, both have upbringings that have focussed upon proper conduct. 87. On the other hand for each there is what I have called present priorities which are such that neither is able to acknowledge their conduct or his conduct was wrong. By the phrase “priorities are such” I refer to their commitment to their families and a realisation that any admission of improper conduct may reflect not only on them personally but on their families. I also include each one’s sense of loyalty to the other. No doubt each also has a fear of what an admission of improper conduct would mean to his own self image. 88. Important as each and every one of those priorities is, while they are more important to them, that is to each of the accused, more important than acknowledging guilt, the court must view each as lacking insight into his offending conduct and any compassion for the impact his offending conduct had upon the victim. Such a lack of insight into conduct of such high criminal order, suggests rehabilitation may not develop with the speed one would otherwise have anticipated given the other factors.Deterrence89. These offences are offences committed by young men in their capacity as adults, as such they are offences that call for condign punishment. Such punishment is for the purpose of deterring other would be offenders. There is also an element of personal deterrence encapsulated in any term of imprisonment. I am well aware how seriously each offender and his family regard a prison sentence and how painful such an outcome must be for each offender and the members of the family. That was so eloquently demonstrated by Haralabidis’ mother’s evidence. I acknowledge much that Mrs Haralabidis said about the harm prison does to young men. It is a sentence of last resort. When the offending is such that condign punishment is called for, that is the only time one turns to imprisonment. Regrettably the offending conduct before me calls for such imprisonment. The maximum penalty for each of the aggravated sexual assault offences is 20 years with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The maximum penalty for count 4 against Haralabidis is 14 years with a standard non-parole period of 7.Should a Standard Non-Parole Period Be Set For Offences That Fall within The Mid Range 90. Section 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (The Act) requires the court to set a standard non-parole period for offences falling within a mid range of objective seriousness unless the court determines there are reasons for setting a longer or shorter period than the standard non-parole period. Way’s case (R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168) determines that that is particularly so after a trial of the issues. In considering the reasons for setting a longer or shorter parole period, the court is confined to the reasons specified in s 21A of the Act. If there be any such reasons the court is required to identify in the remarks on sentence each factor it has taken into account. There appears to be four pathways provided by s 21A to reach reasons for setting a longer or shorter parole period. 
     
      
      The check list of aggravating factors found in s 21A(2) 
      The check list of mitigating factors found in s 21A(3) 
      Any other objective or subjective factor that effects the relative seriousness of the offence 
      Any other matters that are required or permitted to be taken into account by the court under any Act or Rule of law 
      
    Section 21A(2)(e)(a) makes the commission of an offence in the presence of a child under eighteen as a matter of aggravation. It is of course agreed the complainant was under eighteen. I have already taken into account her age when reviewing the objective criminality. Assuming for the moment “in the presence of” applies also to the victim - a proposition that seems a little dubious - I would not regard it as a circumstance of aggravation in this case under s 21A(2) because I have taken it into account when considering the first element of the offence and not surprisingly have taken it into account adversely to both accused. 91. I am satisfied there are no factors established in the evidence calling for a longer parole period than the standard non-parole period.Mitigating Matters92. I have found the offence was not part of a planned criminal activity. I have found each offender has no criminal record. I have found each offender is a person of good character. 93. I am prepared to find that neither offender was fully aware of the consequence of his actions because of his age. I have earlier referred to the ongoing deep rooted and serious psychological impact the night of 5 April had upon DB. As this offending conduct was proceeding on 5 April I am satisfied neither offender foresaw the lasting deep seated psychological sequelae. It should not be thought that I am saying Ms DB’s response was extraordinary. Sadly responses such as hers from the trauma of sustained sexual assault is all too frequent. Although the evidence is scant to make the finding enough has been revealed of their age, background, education level for me to use my life experiences, understanding of the late development of the males’ brains, capacity to make judgment calls and to take account of the evidence of Mrs Haralabidis to satisfy myself on the balance of probabilities neither was fully aware of the consequences of his act. 94. All of the above matters I have just referred to fall under the provisions of s 21A(3). Each is a matter which may provide reasons for setting a shorter than standard non-parole period. 95. There is also one further matter that I am required to take into account under a well established principle of sentencing. In Hearne (2007) 124 A. Crim. R. 457 the Court of Criminal Appeal accepted a submission that the youth factor was not to be diminished merely because of the seriousness of a crime on the basis that consideration of general deterrence is not as important as it is when sentencing adults and considerations of rehabilitation should be regarded as very important. Now that may be a little generous then what the court said. I think it really confined itself to saying that the youth factor was not to be diminished merely because of the seriousness of the crime. In reviewing a number of cases the court observed: 
     
      
      “Courts have taken the view that the younger the offender, the greater the weight to be afforded to the element of youth.” 
       
      
    In Hearne’s case it made a finding that: 
     
      
      “Although an adult may have reacted as he did (Hearne was a “young person”) and the reaction was one of violence, it is not possible to postulate that his reason was not influenced by the immaturity of youth.” 
       
      
    The rule of law requires recognition of youth. The finding made by the Court of Criminal Appeal in Hearne’s case is equally apposite in this case. Both these offenders are young adults but their level of maturity and related brain functioning are still in early states of development by comparison with more mature males. The practice is that accommodation of youth when sentencing for serious criminal offending that really reflects otherwise adult behaviour such as this case is done particularly through the non-parole period and usually by a finding of special circumstances. The requirement to set a standard non-parole period seriously inhibits the operation of this important principle. I am satisfied a parole period less than the standard non-parole period is called for in each of the mid range offences.Special Circumstances96. In respect of both offenders I find special circumstances. For reasons I have just given my principal reason for finding special circumstances is the youth of each offender. Full-time custody is non productive of rehabilitation opportunities and motivation. I do not mean to demean them, but such courses as are offered in custody are not completed in a proper learning environment; not consistent in quality teaching content or supervision of pupils. Full-time custody is an artificial environment, rehabilitation is better achieved within a community based setting. A Question Of Current Or Cumulative Sentencing 97. So far as Haralabidis is concerned there are two sites where his criminality is conducted. There will be an accumulation of sentences between count 4 and the remaining counts. So far as both offenders are concerned the offending in the car while made up of a number of offences is really a continuous stream of offending conduct. I will impose concurrent sentences for all of those offences that occurred in the car.Setting The Sentences98. While I have determined that the standard non-parole period will not apply to any of the offences I am dealing with, I must recognise that I am still required to bear it and its purposes in mind when I come to sentence. That will require some upward drive of the actual sentences imposed.Parity99. For the offending in the car I have sought to treat each offender the same as the other. I regard their criminality as equivalent, their subjective features also bear striking similarity.Sentencing Orders100. Haralabidis, I convict you that on 5 April at Earlwood in the state of New South Wales you had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing she was not consenting. For that offence you are sentenced to a minimum term of 18 months with a balance of term of 6 months (this amended sentencing order was made on the 26th February 2010). That will be to commence on 24 January 2010, that is five days ago to give you credit for the five days you otherwise had. 101. I also convict you of all other offences that are in these terms:- That on 5 April at Earlwood in the state of New South Wales you had sexual intercourse with the complainant without her consent, knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely that you and Petropoulos were in each other’s company.102. In respect of count 5 which was described as digital penetration by you I sentence you to a non parole period of two and a half years to date from 24 July 2010, that is a six month accumulation and a balance of term of two years.103. In respect of count 6, oral sex on Petropoulos and you were in company, I sentence you to a non parole period of two years to commence on the same date and an additional term of two years.104. In respect of the anal intercourse by you, I sentence to a sentence of three years imprisonment to commence on 24 July 2010, that is the non parole period and a further three years additional term.105. In respect of oral intercourse upon you in a situation where your penis was soiled, you are likewise sentenced to a term of three years non parole and an additional term of three years, again to commence on 24 July 2010.106. In respect of count 9 which is the digital penetration by Petropoulos you are sentenced to a term of two years non parole with a two year additional term. In respect of the anal intercourse offence by Petropoulos which is count 10, you are sentenced to a term of two years with a balance of term of two years. So, that is two years non parole with a balance of term of two years.107. In respect of the anal intercourse by Petropoulos when the complainant was sitting on his lap, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years with a balance of term of two years. With the resumed anal intercourse by Petropoulos, again the sentence is two years in custody non parole with a balance of term of two years.108. For the oral intercourse on you which was the last offence that occurred, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two and a half years -imprisonment - non parole period with a balance of term of two years. 109. Your overall sentence will be one of six and a half years with an overall non parole period of three and a half years.HEAZLEWOOD: Can I just interrupt your Honour, you didn’t make a commencement date for those last few sentences but I assume they were all to commence in July.HIS HONOUR: I will make it clear they will all commence on 24 July 2010.HEAZLEWOOD: I just wanted to clarify that.HIS HONOUR: 110. Mr Petropoulos you are convicted of all offences that were in these terms, there are nine of them:- That you on 5 April 2008 at Earlwood did have sexual intercourse with the complainant without the consent of the complainant knowing she was not consenting in circumstances of aggravation, namely that Haralabidis was with you in your company and you were in the company of each other.111. In respect of count 5 which is the digital penetration, all of your sentences will date from 29 January so I will not repeat those dates, all from the 29th. You were in company with Haralabidis when he digitally penetrated the complainant. You are sentenced to a non parole period of two years and a balance of term of two years.112. For the oral sex upon you, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two and a half years with a balance of term of two years.113. With the anal intercourse offence by Haralabidis count 7, you are sentenced to a term of two years non parole with a balance of term of two years.114. For the oral intercourse upon Haralabidis in circumstances where his penis was soiled, you are sentenced to two years non parole and a balance of term of two years.115. For the digital penetration by you of the complainant, you are sentenced to two and a half years with a balance of term of two years.116. With the anal intercourse by you, you are sentenced to a term of imprisonment non parole period of three years with a balance of term of three years.117. With the anal intercourse by you when the complainant is put on your lap, that sentence is two and a half years non parole and a balance of term of two years.118. With the anal intercourse resumed when she went back to the initial position, that also is a two and a half year term of non parole with an additional term of two years.119. With the oral intercourse on Haralabidis, that is the last offence when you had left the car but were still in the vicinity supporting him, for that offence you are sentenced to a non parole period of two years and a balance of term of two years. 120. The overall effect of the sentence that I have given you is a six year term of imprisonment with a non parole period of three years from today.121. Both of you, would you listen carefully to what I now have to say. Normally when a judge sentences someone and gives an overall sentence of three or less years he can order that person’s release to parole. As you will see in your case I cannot make that order. That order can only be made by the Parole Board. You will have to persuade the Parole Board that you can be released without danger to yourself or to any other member of the community. One factor that will be important in the Parole Board’s determining whether they will release you or not will be your rehabilitation progress. One of the indicators of your rehabilitation progress will be your attitude to this offence when 2012 or 2013 comes along and whether you still hold then the same views in respect of the offence as you now hold.122. I should tell you that if you do not succeed at the first hearing you will remain in prison for another twelve months before you are given another hearing. And if you do not succeed at the second hearing you will remain in prison for another twelve months until you are given another chance. That is a fact I suspect a lot of fellows do not know. You only get one chance a year. Any other matter?RAILTON: Your Honour in respect to the count 4 for Mr Haralabidis, it is my understanding where it’s an offence with the standard non parole period you are not able to set a fixed term of imprisonment, it has to have a non parole period set. [Legal discussion - sentence later amended pursuant to s.43 Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act HIS HONOUR: I recommend to the Corrective Services and I’ll put this on the warrant that they be classified. They’ve never been into prison before, they’re both young, both vulnerable, get them out of there as quick as you can. I recommend that they be classified as quickly as possible. Thank you, I’ll adjourn.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, who is a juvenile, pleaded guilty on arraignment to two charges: the first is that, on or about 14 June 2008, he murdered Daniel Owen; the second is that, on or about the same date, being in company he assaulted Richard Young with intent to rob him. The two offences are connected in that they occurred within a very short period of time, at about the same location and they both arose from the offender’s suggestion to his companion, also a juvenile, that they rob someone to obtain money. 
     
      
    2 The offence of murder carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. Because the offender is a juvenile, there is no standard non-parole period applicable. The robbery offence is contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years. 
     
      
    3 The offender is to be dealt with according to law for the murder offence. Written submissions on behalf of the offender, received after the matter was reserved, argued that the Court should not sentence the offender at law for the robbery offence. I accept that I do have power to deal with him under Division 4 of Part 3 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act for that offence. It was pointed out in the submissions that offenders sentenced by the Children’s Court rarely receive control orders for offences of this kind. I have no doubt that, notwithstanding the seriousness of the conduct, the offender would be unlikely to receive any sentence more severe than probation had he been dealt with in that jurisdiction for that offence alone. 
     
      
    4 But it is not appropriate to sentence the offender as if the robbery offence stood alone; Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294. Different considerations would apply had that been the only matter for sentence, and clearly rehabilitation would take precedence over the other purposes of punishment. But it is not proper sentencing procedure to consider each offence in isolation, see R v JRD [2007] NSWCCA 55. The offender is not to be sentenced more harshly because of the presence of another offence but matters of mitigation that might have applied have little or no relevance because the offender is to be sentenced for the offence of murder. Sentencing options that might otherwise have been applied are no longer relevant in light of the fact that the offender must receive a substantial term of imprisonment for the murder. The only issue is whether the robbery offence warrants an increase in the penalty otherwise appropriate for the murder. As a matter of practicality, if there should be some increase in the period of custody, there would be no difference between a control order and a term of imprisonment. 
     
      
    5 There was an agreed statement of facts tendered but it was augmented by evidence given from the offender who adopted an account he gave to a psychiatrist, Dr Westmore, of the circumstances of the killing. He was not cross-examined on this aspect of his evidence. 
     
      
    6 The facts can be summarised as follows. On the night of 13 June 2008 the offender and his co-accused were at a party at a club in Tempe. Friends picked them up from the party after 11 pm in a motor vehicle and the offender was noticeably intoxicated. In the vehicle the offender suggested to his co-accused that they rob someone. He said, “ Let’s pop a roll.” His companion agreed. They were let out of the vehicle in Illawarra Road, Marrickville for the purpose of finding someone to rob. 
     
      
    7 Shortly after 12.05 am on 14 June the deceased was found in the driveway of 476 Illawarra Road, lying face down in a large pool of blood. He was aged 31 and resided in a unit at that address. When ambulance officers arrived a short time later, he was pronounced dead. The deceased’s wallet was found in the driveway and was empty of cash. DNA was found in the wallet that matched that of the co-accused. The deceased’s keys were found a short distance away but his mobile telephone was missing. An autopsy revealed that he had died from “blunt force head injuries”. It was clear that the assailant or assailants had stomped on his head and face numerous times. Shoe patterns were located on his skull, face and neck. There were also rib fractures. 
     
      
    8 The deceased’s mobile phone records showed that it had been used 9 times after it had been taken from him at the time of the killing. One of the calls was to a female. Communications made on the mobile phone were lawfully intercepted and included a conversation between the offender and the female that included admissions by him to his involvement in the robbery of the deceased. Two days after the murder the offender spoke to a person on the phone and said “I hit one cunt and got his phone. I got it stashed…….It’s a mad one”. He also said, “I hit one and put him to sleep”. 
     
      
    9 On 28 July police spoke with the co-accused and received a pair of shoes from him. The tread on these matched the patterns observed upon the deceased’s head. Later that day a telephone call was intercepted between the offender and another male. The offender was informed of the account given to police by the co-accused and that it had omitted any reference to being in Illawarra Road. The offender was advised to give the same account. 
     
      
    10 Subsequent investigations showed that the patterns on the sole of the shoes obtained from the offender did not match those upon the deceased. 
     
      
    11 The Crown case against the offender is that he participated in the infliction of injuries upon the deceased with the intention of inflicting grievous bodily harm upon him and is, therefore, guilty of murder. 
     
      
    12 The robbery offence arises from an attack upon a 20 year old man who was riding his bike on Illawarra Road just before midnight on 13 June. He was knocked off his bike and suffered injuries to his face and head. Some of his property including an Ipod and a key were found in Illawarra Road. 
     
      
    13 The offender was arrested on 30 July. He declined to be interviewed by police about the events. 
     
      
    14 He was born on 10 November 1991 and is of Aboriginal descent. He has no criminal record. He is the eldest of three children from the relationship of his parents who separated when the offender was aged 12. Shortly after the separation the offender went to live with his father but continued a positive relationship with his mother. The offender is very close to his father because of their common interest in Rugby League. 
     
      
    15 He completed his School Certificate but his results were poor. He was in receipt of Centrelink benefits up until his arrest. He enrolled in a TAFE course in an Aboriginal Electrician Apprenticeship but participated for only a week before he was taken into custody for the present offences. He has been continuing studies for Year 11 subjects while in custody. He has been reporting for his classes and proceeding well. He has been considered as a role model for other inmates. He won a prize for Aboriginal art. 
     
      
    16 There was a psychiatric report in evidence. The offender gave an account that was not challenged in cross-examination. He stated that the co-accused hit the victim of the robbery off his bike and knocked him out. The victim’s pockets were searched but little of value was found. They walked toward near-by flats when a taxi stopped and the deceased alighted. The offender claimed he was urinating at the time. According to him the co-accused almost immediately attacked the deceased and started kicking him. The offender ran up and kicked the deceased once to the face. He thought that “things were getting out of hand” and tried to stop the attack by the co-accused but he was unsuccessful. When the violence eventually ceased the offender searched the deceased’s pockets. He gave the co-accused the wallet and keys he found but kept the mobile phone. 
     
      
    17 I am prepared to accept this account although I believe that the offender is minimising his involvement in the assault. In any case on his account he witnessed what was happening to the unfortunate deceased and joined in the violence by kicking the defenceless man in the face. 
     
      
    18 The offender gave the psychiatrist a history of consuming alcohol from the age of 13 and drinking three or four times a week after leaving school. He maintained he was not aggressive after drinking alcohol. He has occasionally used different types of prohibited drugs. He has completed a drug and alcohol course while in custody. There is nothing otherwise of significance in the report. 
     
      
    19 A number of achievement awards received by the offender during his period in custody were tendered before me. They confirm the assessment of the offender’s progress contained in the Juvenile Justice report. There is in evidence a letter concerning the offender’s selection for enrolment in an Indigenous Pre-Apprenticeship Programme that will lead to an apprenticeship as an electrician or in some similar trade. The letter praises the offender’s level of commitment to the course. 
     
      
    20 Evidence was given by members of the public as to the standing of the offender in the community before his arrest, particularly in relation to his sporting prowess and sportsmanship. They are of the one mind that the offender’s conduct was out of character. One witness indicated in answer to a question by me that he had never seen the offender under the influence of alcohol. 
     
      
    21 The difficulty with these opinions is that they are inconsistent with the actions of the offender on the night in question. It was his decision that he and his co-accused would get out of the vehicle with the intention of robbing some person simply because they wanted some money to continue drinking alcohol. Even if I accept completely the offender’s account of his involvement in the death of the deceased, and I do not, he was prepared to participate in a violent attack upon the head of a defenceless and completely innocent person, the attack being completely unnecessary for the purpose of robbery. On his own account he kicked him to the face. And yet this is a young man who is praised for acting with such sportsmanship on the football field that he is a role model to others. 
     
      
    22 There are expressions of remorse by the offender found in the reports before me. He read a letter that I believe was largely composed by his father but was said to express his thoughts about his conduct. It conveys remorse, regret and sympathy for the deceased’s family. The difficulty with these expressions are that they are inconsistent with what he said to people about the incident shortly after it occurred, even when he knew that the deceased was very seriously injured if not dead. In evidence he sought to explain these statements in that he was “big-noting himself”. Again I have difficulty in reconciling what the offender said about the assault upon the deceased with the type of person that the witnesses described. There is no suggestion that he was under the influence of alcohol at the time of these conversations. 
     
      
    23 The offender pleaded guilty 11 months after the charges had been laid but while still in the Children’s Court. He should receive a discount of 20 per cent for the utilitarian value of his plea. I accept now that he is genuinely remorseful. After hearing the truly moving victim impact statement read by the very emotional father of the deceased, he would have to be a sociopath not to regret his actions and the death of an innocent young man returning to his home after finishing work. 
     
      
    24 As I attempted to make clear to the deceased’s family at the hearing, I cannot sentence the offender simply on the basis of retribution and by attempting to equate the loss of the life of the deceased with a period of custody for the offender. That would be an impossible task but in any event it is not how the criminal law operates. No punishment that could be imposed upon the offender could redress the dreadful effects upon the family of the deceased’s cruel and violent death. It had nothing to do with robbing him. He was not even given the chance of complying with a demand for money. It was a senseless act of gross brutality by young men under the influence of alcohol. As such it deserves a severe penalty but not one that can be influenced by the effects upon the family however traumatic they may be. 
     
      
    25 I must take into account established principles relating to the sentencing of juveniles and the sentence to be imposed is far less than one that would be imposed even had the offender been a young adult. It may seem curious that the courts draw such a distinction between persons under the age of 18 and those above that age, but such a distinction runs through other facets of everyday life in the community. It has statutory recognition in the laws relating to criminal proceedings involving persons under the age of 18 years. The sentences imposed by the Childrens Court bear little or no relationship to those imposed in the Local or District Court for the same crimes. The distinction is even greater now that the standard non-parole provisions do not apply to persons under the age of 18 when they commit the offence. 
     
      
    26 However, this is another case of senseless and serious violence on public streets by young males under the influence of alcohol. General deterrence is appropriate despite the age of the offender. The matters set out in s 6 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act have less relevance because of the seriousness of the offence of murder and in light of the inevitability of a sentence bearing some proportion to the seriousness of the particular killing. I accept that in the infliction of violence the offender played a lesser role than his co-accused, but he was a willing participant in the causing of serious injury upon the deceased simply for that purpose. He was the initiator of the criminal activity that resulted in the killing and the serious robbery offence. The Crown accepts that there was no intention to kill but I believe the intention of both the offender and his co-accused was to inflict grievous bodily harm to a very significant degree. 
     
      
    27 The murder requires a substantial sentence notwithstanding the subjective features of the offender. I take into account of course that the offender was 16 years of age at the time of the offending but there is nothing to show that the offence was a result of any immaturity or a lack of appreciation of the seriousness of his conduct. Yet it is rare to find a person as young as the offender charged with murder. There is nothing in his background that explains his behaviour. I accept that it was inconsistent with his normal character, but I do not believe that it is explained simply by the fact that he was under the influence of alcohol. I have noted the callousness in his attitude to the offences as disclosed in the telephone calls. 
     
      
    28 I have been referred to a number of other cases of sentences imposed on a juvenile for murder. One of the cases was a sentencing decision of mine in R v MB [2006] NSWSC 1164. Although the offender unsuccessfully appealed against his conviction there was no appeal against the sentence imposed. That was a case where the offender intended to inflict grievous bodily harm when he slashed the throat of the deceased with a broken bottle during a brawl between the deceased and his friend on one side and a group of drunken young men on the other. There a weapon was used but there was only one act of violence that brought about the death of the deceased. I doubt that it was a worse case than this but, if it was, not by any significant degree. That offender was sentenced to imprisonment for 22 years with a non-parole period of 15 years and 6 months. He was aged 16 years with good character and was being sentenced without any discount. However, it should be noted that, when that offender was sentenced, the standard non-parole period of 20 years applied to juvenile offenders. 
     
      
    29 In R v McAuliffe (1993) 70 A Crim R 303 two brothers aged 16 and 17 planned to rob someone and in the result killed one of their victims. They were both armed, one with a hammer and one with a stick. They were each sentenced for the murder to imprisonment for 20 years with a minimum term of 12 years. The Court of Criminal Appeal dismissed the appeal against sentence. During the course of his judgment Gleeson CJ stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Violent attacks of this kind, by young people, are disturbingly prevalent, and the need for general deterrence must be stressed. It is common experience that they can result in loss of life, even though there was no intention to kill. 
        
       
       
      I interject to say that those remarks were made in 1993. 
       
      
    30 This was a decision given before the concept of a standard non-parole period had evolved. There is little doubt that since the introduction of the standard non-parole period sentences for murder have increased. Care should be taken not to allow that increase to be reflected in cases of juveniles where the standard non-parole period now does not apply. The present is not as serious a case as McAuliffe because the offenders there were armed. However, at the time that those offenders were sentenced there was no concept of special circumstances limiting the fixing of minimum terms. 
     
      
    31 I was also directed to the decision in R v JB and RJH [1999] NSWCCA 93. In that case two juveniles attacked the deceased in order to rob him and he was hit repeatedly to the head with a large rock. They both pleaded guilty to murder. JB was aged 15 years and 11 months. He pleaded guilty and gave assistance to the authorities. He had an extensive criminal history but suffered from some mental deficiencies. He was sentenced to 16 years with a minimum term of 11 years. RJH was almost 18 years of age with a better subjective case than JB. He was sentenced to 18 years with a minimum of 12 years. The Court dismissed the appeals in both cases, although it recognised the sentences as being heavy. Again there was no limitation on the fixing of non-parole periods and discounts for pleas of guilty were less than they are now. 
     
      
    32 The offence committed by this offender was a serious case of murder because it was so senseless and vicious. Although unplanned, the offender and his co-accused planned to use violence to rob some person. There is some mitigation in the fact that the offender tried to stop his co-accused but only after he had himself joined in the brutal attack on a completely innocent and defenceless person. The offender can rely upon his young age, his good character and his conduct since being in custody. There are obviously good prospects of rehabilitation. It is difficult to determine whether he is likely to offend again because I do not understand why he offended as he did on this occasion. As I have already indicated, I accept that now he is genuinely remorseful. 
     
      
    33 In my opinion the sentence for the murder prior to discount should be 19 years. A reduction of 20 per cent results in a sentence of roughly 15 years. There should be a fixed term of 6 months for the robbery offence but that will be concurrent. It seems to me that the murder is so serious that there is no purpose in extending his period in custody for the robbery offence. There may be reasons for finding special circumstances, the most significant matters being his youth and his prospects for rehabilitation. But they are factors that have weighed heavily in reducing the overall sentence and by the decision not to impose any sentence for the robbery. The same can be said of the fact that it is his first time in custody, a matter that I do not believe gives rise to special circumstances in any event. However, in recognition of the effort he has made while in custody and to encourage him to continue with his studies, I will find special circumstances and reduce the non-parole period to the least possible period he must serve by way of punishment for his crimes. There should be a non-parole period of 10 years 6 months. 
     
      
    34 Had the offender been sentenced when the standard non-parole period provisions applied to juveniles the sentence would have been significantly greater. I understand it must be particularly galling to the deceased’s family that the offender will be released from custody at an age younger than was the deceased when he was killed. 
     
      
    35 The offender is sentenced for murder to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 10 years 6 months to date from 30 July 2008 and to expire on 29 January 2019 the date upon which the offender is eligible to be released to parole. There is to be a balance of term of 3 years 9 months from 30 January 2019. 
     
      
    36 The offender is sentenced for the assault with intent to rob and in company to imprisonment for 6 months dated from 30 July 2008 and that expired on 29 January 2009. I have imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for that offence having regard to the sentence imposed for the murder. 
     
      
    37 It should be made clear that because the offender is eligible to be released on 29 January 2019 that date is not certain. The offender must prove by way of his conduct in custody during that period that he is a person who is fit and appropriate to be released into the community without further concern for offences of violence of this nature. 
     
      
    38 I also want to make it clear that I am, as I understand it, required to impose a sentence that will require the offender to be removed to an adult prison once he turns the age of 18. I raised with Ms Rigg, Public Defender, who appears for the offender, the relevant provision of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act in relation to orders that this Court can or cannot make in relation to where the offender is to spend his period in custody. I have drawn her attention to section 19(3) of that Act in relation to the requirement that this Court finds special circumstances before making an order that would enable the offender to remain in a juvenile institution after the age of 18. 
     
      
    39 It may well be the case that, having regard to the offender’s current attitudes to study, his remorse and the progress that he has made, particularly in relation to the apprenticeship programme that he has entered, that the better place for his rehabilitation might well be in a juvenile detention centre. However, there is no evidence before me at the present time that would enable me to find special circumstances to make an order under section 19(3) which would permit him to remain in a juvenile detention centre after the age of 18. The real concern, of course, is that in his current custody everybody in that detention centre is aimed with the rehabilitation of the offender at the utmost. Unfortunately, when he is removed into an adult prison system that will no longer be the case. 
     
      
    40 It seems to me that on the present evidence I am unable to make an order under section 19(3) which would permit the offender to remain in a juvenile detention centre, at least up until the age of 21, even if I thought that were the appropriate place. 
     
      
    41 I leave it open at the present time for the offender to come back before me with appropriate evidence in order to try to convince me that there are special reasons why I should make an order at least permitting him to remain in a juvenile centre until the age of 21. At the present stage, however, I make no order as to where the offender is to spend the period of custody.

       REMARKS ON SENTENCE  
       
      
    1 His Honour: The jury on 9 November 2009 found Harb Gabriel, the offender, not guilty of the charge that he on 28 January 2008 did murder Wadad Isber but guilty of manslaughter.  
     
      
    2 On the first day of the trial and in the presence of the jury panel, the offender pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty of manslaughter. The Crown did not accept the plea of guilty of manslaughter in full discharge of the indictment and the trial proceeded on the charge of murder. Wadad Isber was the offender’s wife. During the trial, the offender accepted that on the afternoon of 21 January 2008 he had struck his wife in the garage of their Baulkham Hills home seven times to the head with a skutch hammer thereby inflicting really serious head injuries upon her from which she died on 28 January 2008. It was the offender’s case that at the time he struck the deceased with the first blow with the skutch hammer that he did not intend to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm upon her but was acting in self-defence as his wife had attacked him with a knife. He was, for the six blows which then followed, acting under provocation. The offender also contended that, at the time of the offence, he was substantially impaired by reason of an abnormality of mind.  
     
      
    3 It is my duty to determine the facts relevant to sentencing the offender. My view of the facts must be consistent with the verdict of the jury and the findings of fact I make against the offender must be arrived at beyond reasonable doubt: Isaacs v R (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 378-379. Matters in mitigation may be proved on the balance of probabilities: R v Pilley (1991) 56 A Crim R 202.  
     
      
       
      Self-defence  
       
      
    4 The Crown submits that the jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did not act in self-defence but was not satisfied that the offender was not acting under provocation. Mr Dailly SC for the offender contends that the offender was found guilty by the jury on the basis of provocation but with elements of self-defence and substantial impairment contributing. It was said that all these matters operate together to reduce the objective seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    5 On the issue of self-defence, the Crown put to me that I would have some doubt accepting the offender’s evidence that the deceased cut him with the knife. The Crown founded this submission on the evidence that was before the jury of the absence of blood spatter on the knife and of the re-arranging of the scene of the crime before the police arrived. The Crown was, however, content to proceed upon the basis that the deceased came at the offender with a knife.  
     
      
    6 When considering this issue, it is sufficient to commence with those events which occurred on 21 January 2008 upon the offender’s return to his home at Baulkham Hills after having lunch with his daughter Vanessa and Mrs Clarke-Gabriel. During that lunch his daughter Emily’s wedding had been discussed. The offender told the deceased that Emily’s wedding was going to cost $5,000 and if he did not return to Australia for it he would invite Emily and her husband to Lebanon. An argument followed after which the offender went inside the garage to listen to the 2pm news on the radio. He heard that the Lebanese presidential election had been postponed. The offender then told his wife that he was not going to Lebanon as it was unsafe and he was happy in Australia. The significance of these conversations will be clarified when I come to consider the relationship between the offender and his wife. The deceased became angry calling him a liar and asking where was the house he had promised her in Lebanon. He decided to go for a walk but received a phone call from Vanessa who told him she was on her way over to his home. The phone records (exhibit O) indicate that this call was made at about 2.35pm  
     
      
    7 When Vanessa arrived and saw her father at the front door she noticed a cut across his head and a cut to his left hand. After Vanessa left, it was the offender’s testimony that he went to the bathroom and cleaned his forehead to stop the bleeding. He then went back to the garage, turned the light on and saw the deceased on the ground with a lot of blood on her. He then rang Mr Eid, his solicitor, from the telephone next to the garage. The phone records establish that this call was made at 2.45pm. The only rational inference to be drawn from all the circumstances is that the violence between the offender and the deceased occurred shortly before Vanessa knocked on the front door. The cuts to the offender were to the forehead, left cheek and between the fingers of the left hand. These were minor injuries. Dr Langlois, a pathologist, told the jury that a typical defensive injury when a knife is involved is a cut between the fingers where the person being attacked has attempted to grab the knife. The pathologist did not find any defensive wounds on the deceased. The Crown did not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the cuts on the offender were self-inflicted.  
     
      
    8 The jury accepted that following the phone call between the offender and Vanessa, the deceased placed a kitchen knife to the offender’s throat, telling him to put the house up for auction and to get the money that was owed by Mr Nassif. During the struggles which then followed in the house and in the garage, the offender was cut slightly by the knife and the wounds which I have described at [7] above were inflicted. As the offender thought that his wife was going to kill him, he grabbed something beside him which was the skutch hammer. The light was not on in the garage. He aimed it towards where the knife was in order to get it away from her.  
     
      
    9 Before proceeding further, it is apposite to consider an aspect of the evidence of Dr Pitham and Dr Langlois. Dr Pitham was the neurosurgeon who operated on the deceased at Westmead Hospital after she was brought in by ambulance at about 4pm. Dr Pitham testified that he observed the presence of seven very clear wounds of identical size in the deceased’s scalp. They had penetrated the scalp in such a way that they were arranged in a line that passed from just above the right ear up and over the top of the head, crossing the midline and then slightly across to the left. Each one of these injuries was almost perfectly parallel with all of the other ones so that the effect was that they almost made a straight line over the top of the head. What was described by Dr Pitham as the seventh injury was on the left side of the skull just across from the other six wounds but completely parallel with them and in the same arc. Dr Pitham told the jury that this “was an exceptional case of extraordinary wounds that were arranged in such a precise fashion so that we all stood back, all of the people in the operating theatre who were involved in the case, marvelled at the precision of the wounds that were inflicted”: T 254 L- 48 T 255 L -1.  
     
      
    10 Dr Pitham expressed the opinion that the pattern and the location of the seven wounds suggested that the deceased was lying on the ground and the offender must have been (whether standing, crouching, kneeling or sitting on a chair) in the same position whilst these wounds were being inflicted.  
     
      
    11 It seems to me that if all of what was said by Dr Pitham was accepted by the members of the jury, their verdict could neither have been manslaughter by self-defence nor by provocation. The verdict could only have been guilty of murder unless the partial defence of substantial impairment by abnormality of mind was established on the balance of probabilities by the offender. I conclude that the jury did not find that all of the seven blows were struck by the offender when his wife was lying on the ground and all seven were inflicted in an egregiously consistent pattern.  
     
      
    12 Dr Langlois, however, gave evidence of a depressed triangular area of fracture towards the left of the vertex of the skull which he described as wound number 2. The area of fracturing was 2.5 by 2 centimetres and was caused, in his opinion, not by surgical intervention but by some blunt object. I conclude that, notwithstanding the disadvantage that the pathologist had in conducting his examination after there had been significant surgical intervention, the jury must have accepted the evidence of Dr Langlois and found that wound no 2 was caused by the first blow struck by the offender. The jury was not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that in striking this blow the offender had an intention to kill or to inflict grievous bodily harm.  
     
      
    13 The offender told the jury that he could not remember what happened after the first blow. The skutch hammer weighed 2.046kg and is a stonemason’s tool. By the first blow the deceased was knocked to the garage floor severely injured and was rendered unconscious. The jury was satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that any danger to the offender from the deceased had passed after the first blow and the offender with that knowledge deliberately struck the deceased on the skull a further six times with the skutch hammer. For all of the blows, the deceased had been struck by the wedge of the skutch hammer. Dr Pitham told the jury that each of the seven wounds had an underlying skull fracture. Four of the fractures were minimally displaced and the other three fractures involved the skull being deeply displaced into the structure of the brain. All of the fractures, including those that were minimally displaced, involved penetration through the skull and all of them penetrated the brain to a greater or lesser extent. All of the blows required a similar very large amount of force in order to penetrate the skull. In three of the seven blows the wedge of the skutch hammer penetrated the brain all the way into its centre. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that at the time he struck the further six blows, the offender had the intention to kill his wife.  
     
      
    14 The Crown established beyond reasonable doubt that, apart from the first blow, the offender did not believe that what he did was necessary to defend himself. The jury went on to consider whether the Crown had established that the offender was not acting under provocation. All of the jury’s questions after the jury had retired to consider its verdict were confined to provocation which provides a clear indication of the importance that the members of the jury attached to this issue.  
     
      
       
      Provocation  
       
      
    15 The offender was assessed by Dr Korbel a psychiatrist on 2 February 2008. Dr Korbel recorded that the offender claimed that he and the deceased argued about her wish to return to Lebanon, she assaulted him with a knife and he “lost it”. On 13 June 2009 the offender told Dr Allnutt, a forensic psychiatrist, that “he could recall hitting [the deceased] once or twice, he thought he must have “lost it” but was unable to remember clearly; she fell to the ground.” It was the offender’s case at trial that the six blows to the deceased were the result of a loss of self-control that was induced by the deceased’s conduct towards him over the years. The triggering events for the loss of self-control were said to be the attack upon him by the deceased with the knife and the argument which immediately preceded it. I turn now to consider the relationship between the deceased and the offender.  
     
      
     
     
      
     
     
      
     
     
      
       
      The relationship between the deceased and the offender  
       
      
    16 The offender was born in Lebanon where he attended school to the age of about 14 years and then in the tradition of his family became a stonemason. When he was 20 years old, he migrated to Australia and settled in Sydney. The offender built up a successful business as a stonemason. He married Heather Clarke and there were three children of the marriage. Mrs Clarke-Gabriel and the offender divorced in 1994.  
     
      
    17 Whilst in Lebanon in November 2000, the offender was introduced to the deceased who was a widow with two adult children. They married on 30 November 2000. At the time of the marriage, the offender owned a house at xxxxxxx and a rural property in Oberon. The offender was 55 years old and the deceased 39 years old. The deceased remained in Lebanon until she obtained a visa to come to Australia on 12 September 2003.  
     
      
    18 The marriage between the offender and the deceased was beset with arguments between them and periods of separation after she arrived in Sydney and commenced living with the offender at xxxxxxx.  
     
      
    19 There were relatives and friends of the deceased who gave evidence in the Crown case about the relationship between the offender and the deceased. Much of this testimony concerned conversations with the deceased and the offender between 2004 and the beginning of 2006 on occasions when the deceased had left him. The Crown in particular pointed to a conversation between George Esber, the deceased’s cousin, and the offender at a meeting in 2006 when the differences between the offender and the deceased were discussed. Mr Esber recounted that the offender told the deceased that he had “brought [her] here as a maid, not as a wife”. Mouna Azizi, another cousin of the deceased, gave evidence of a conversation with the deceased in 2005 during which the deceased had related that the offender thought that she was his maid. The Crown submitted that the offender was quite detached from the deceased and had no feelings about her as his equal or his wife.  
     
      
    20 The difficulty with this submission was that after those conversations much had transpired between the offender and the deceased. The property xxxxxxx had been sold in July 2006 to enable a house to be built on a block of land which had been purchased in Lebanon and the offender had agreed to live with his wife in that country. Erin Van Ryswyk, the offender’s neighbour, recalled a conversation with the offender about six months prior to the commission of the offence in which he said that “the [deceased] wants to go back to Lebanon as all her family are there”. Mrs Clarke-Gabriel and Vanessa had been told at the lunch on 21 January 2008 by the offender that he was moving to Lebanon and might not be able to attend Emily’s wedding. The rejection of the Crown’s submission does not mean that I have accepted all of the offender’s testimony of his marital relationship. It is evident that there was an element of jealousy and possessiveness in the offender’s attitude towards his wife which I have no doubt contributed to the unhappiness in the marriage.  
     
      
    21 The jury accepted the offender’s evidence that whilst he was arguing with his wife in the lounge room on 21 January 2008 immediately before the attack by her upon him with the knife that he was thinking that she just wanted his money and his children’s money as well, that she had been unfaithful to him and did not love him.  
     
      
    22 There were in particular four occasions which founded the offender’s belief of his wife’s infidelity. The first occasion was when the offender was in Lebanon between August and November 2002 and George Esber, the deceased’s cousin, drove past in a Mercedes 500. The deceased told him that Mr Esber had slept overnight in her flat on the sofa. The second was when he became aware that the deceased was wearing an IUD even though she knew that he had had a vasectomy on 11 January 2002. On the third occasion, the deceased told him that she had slept with xxxxxxx in about March 2005. The fourth occasion happened in September 2007 when he returned to his home after he had been in hospital for about 10 days. He saw a man leaving the premises at the front gate and the window screens of the deceased’s bedroom were torn and had fallen down.  
     
      
    23 I hasten to add that Nahla Makdissi gave evidence of the deceased telling the offender in about mid 2005 that she had never cheated on him and he was “making up these stories.” What is of relevance, however, is the offender’s belief of her infidelity which is supported by his consultations in 2007 with Dr Benjamin, a psychiatrist. In a letter to Dr Azizi, the offender’s general practitioner, Dr Benjamin wrote that the offender believed his second wife was unfaithful to him.  
     
      
    24 There were arguments between the offender and the deceased about money which had started around six to eight months after her arrival in Australia when she wanted money for her son in Lebanon. She had pressured the offender to sell the Oberon property. He had used the settlement monies from that sale to build the house at xxxxxxxx against his wife’s wishes. Another argument concerned the purchase of a Holden Kingswood which was lent to the offender’s son and the deceased’s requests for money for the vehicle. There were negotiations between the offender and the deceased when they separated in December 2004 concerning her share of the assets if she was to return to him. The offender’s testimony that at this time he believed she had come to Australia to get half his assets was supported by the letter dated 16 February 2005 to Wendy Parkinson at the Department of Immigration which the offender had dictated to Mrs Clarke-Gabriel.  
     
      
    25 The offender and the deceased travelled to Lebanon in September 2005. Whilst in Lebanon, they agreed to buy a block of land and to build a house on it for them to stay in whenever they visited and for the deceased’s parents to live in permanently. It was the deceased’s idea to fund the building of the house in Lebanon by the sale of xxxxxxx which was sold in July 2006 for $300,000. The deceased had discussed with him selling both houses and moving everything to Lebanon which he refused to do. It was the offender’s intention to rent xxxxxxxxx when they moved to Lebanon and to eventually leave it to his children. His wife could have the house in Lebanon and she was happy at that time with this arrangement. They, however, could not travel to Lebanon in July 2006 as there was fighting between Israel and Hezbollah.  
     
      
    26 The deceased introduced the offender to Steve Nassif a builder. In August 2006 the offender agreed to lend Mr Nassif $300,000 for six months after which Mr Nassif would pay him $330,000. Another arrangement was entered into with Mr Nassif. The offender agreed to build a house in sandstone for him for $50,000. The deceased also agreed to help Mrs Nassif for four months for which she was to be paid $8,000. It was the intention of the offender and the deceased to go to Lebanon when this money was paid by Mr Nassif. Unfortunately, Mr Nassif failed to make any payment in February 2007. The offender agreed to extend the repayment by Mr Nassif for a further six months for which he was to receive an additional six months interest. The deceased was upset about the monies that were owed by Mr Nassif and they argued about it.  
     
      
    27 As they were arguing a lot and the offender was feeling depressed, he consulted Dr Benjamin. Dr Benjamin was of the opinion that the offender might be suffering with a delusional disorder (jealous type) and a secondary depressive disorder with a differential diagnosis of major depressive disorder with psychotic features. He prescribed Zoloft, an anti-depressant medication, in combination with a low dose of anti-psychotic medication. When the offender saw Dr Benjamin on 18 April 2007, the daily dosage of the anti-psychotic medication was increased. The dosages of the medications were maintained after the offender’s visits to Dr Benjamin in May and August 2007. Regrettably, the offender’s compliance with taking the medication prescribed by the psychiatrist was unreliable. He stopped taking Zoloft about a month before the offence and had not taken the anti-psychotic medication for some time before that.  
     
      
    28 Mr Nassif repaid $330,000 in August 2007 which the offender, on legal advice, accepted as a compromise for all of the monies that Mr Nassif owed. He was not paid for his stonemason’s work nor the additional six months interest. The deceased was not paid the money which was owed to her. As the deceased nagged him about the money which she had not been paid by Mr Nassif the offender gave her a cheque for $8,000. The deceased did not accept that nothing could be done about the balance of the money owed by Mr Nassif. It caused further arguments between them.  
     
      
    29 The deceased pressed the offender to sell xxxxxxx and not to leave any assets in Australia. The offender told her that was unfair to his children and he would never sell the house as they were going to live off the rent whilst in Lebanon. The deceased did not accept this arrangement.  
     
      
    30 They had not left Australia at the end of 2007 as the offender was waiting for the election of the President of Lebanon which had been postponed until 21 January 2008. The offender was not going to move to Lebanon if it was controlled by Hezbollah. The deceased, however, was anxious to return to Lebanon.  
     
      
    31 On 20 January 2008 there was an argument over the money that had not been paid by Mr Nassif. It was the offender’s evidence that the deceased wanted him to threaten to kill Mr and Mrs Nassif in order to get the unpaid money off them and, if he did not want to use a weapon, she would. The offender kept a registered shotgun in a safe in the main bedroom. Whilst I accept that the deceased was upset over the failure by Mr Nassif to pay all of the money, I neither accept that she told the offender that she would use a weapon if he did not nor do I accept that she told him to show her how to use it. In any event, the offender had the only key to the safe and the deceased did not drive a motor vehicle. Nevertheless, I accept that the deceased taunted the offender about his inability to recover all of the money from Mr Nassif. At this time, the offender felt very angry and depressed as he considered that he had gone out of his way to please his wife. He believed that she had been unfaithful to him and that all she wanted was his money.  
     
      
    32 There was another argument between the deceased and the offender on the morning of 21 January 2008. The offender told the jury that before he went to lunch, he drank a [glass] of scotch and took a tablet of Librium. Librium, he said, was his wife’s medication which had been purchased from a chemist in Lebanon and he took the Librium that morning to help him to relax because of his upset following the argument with his wife.  
     
      
    33 No mention was made by the offender that he had taken Librium when he was asked questions by Sergeant Woodbury, the custody manager, at the Castle Hill police station after he had been taken into custody on the day of the offence. There is no reference to Librium in the histories recorded by Dr Allnutt and by Dr John McMahon, a psychologist. When the offender was interviewed by Dr Olav Nielssen, a forensic psychiatrist, on 8 May 2009 the offender said “that he might have taken a tablet of Librium, an anti-anxiety medication prescribed for his wife”. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender did in fact take Librium that morning.  
     
      
    34 The offender testified that he had asked the deceased if she would like to join his daughter and ex-wife at lunch but she had replied that she was not going with him but wished to be taken to the Castle Hill RSL Club. According to the offender, he dissuaded her from going there as he thought his wife would be playing poker machines. What was said by the offender does not sit happily with Vanessa’s evidence that during the lunch her father had told her that his wife had wanted to come to the lunch and he believed that she might be upset with him when he got home. Vanessa impressed me as an honest and reliable witness and I do not think that she was mistaken in her recollection of the conversation. I do not accept that the offender invited the deceased to the lunch. It is necessary to consider the psychiatric and psychological evidence which bears upon the issue of provocation before proceeding further.  
     
      
    The psychiatric and psychological evidence  
     
      
    35 I have recounted at [27] above, the diagnosis of Dr Benjamin who was the offender’s treating psychiatrist in 2007. 
     
      
    36 Dr Allnutt was of the opinion that the offender at the time of the offence had a fronto-temporal dementia and was suffering depression. He said that developing dementia could contribute to the offender’s thinking being more rigid, leading to pre-occupation and over-focussing which could feed into his emotional state. Dr Allnutt considered that because of the offender’s dementia and depression he was more vulnerable to losing self-control and to over-reacting.  
     
      
    37 During the trial Dr Allnutt gave the following evidence T 996 L 23-31:  
     
      
       
        
        “Q. Are you saying, doctor, that his depression and dementia likely had an impact on his capacity for self-control in the situation that he told you of occurred on 21 January 2008?  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        A. I think that he would have been more vulnerable to losing control earlier if levels of stress increased than a person without dementia or depression. In that sense I believe that considering the circumstances being a very high stress situation, if you accept his account that she was coming at him with a knife and there was a big argument, that in that context I would answer that question yes on that basis”.  
        
       
      
    38 Dr Olav Nielssen made three diagnoses. The first was that the offender had a depressive illness which he thought was in remission at the time of the interview as a result of treatment since the offender had been in custody. The second was a possible delusional disorder and the third was probable early dementia.  
     
      
    39 Dr Nielssen opined that the diagnosis of early dementia was likely to have resulted in impairment in the offender’s capacity to control his actions because dementia, particularly dementia affecting the frontal lobes of the brain, is associated with increased impulsivity and decreased logical thinking. Dr Nielssen considered that being in a depressed state, the offender would “… see things as being worse than they are and look at the future in a catastrophic kind of way and hence you would expect his depressive condition to increase the level of hurt that he might have experienced”: T 1081 L 30-34.  
     
      
    40 Dr John McMahon, a psychologist, carried out various tests on the offender, including testing of the frontal lobe of the brain, which demonstrated impairment in a number of sub-scales consistent with impaired planning, judgment and conceptualisation. An MRI, which was conducted on 20 July 2009 showed a number of foci in the white matter on both sides of the offender’s brain. Dr McMahon said that this was evidence of a disease process within the brain of some description. The psychologist concluded that the offender had fronto-temporal dementia and a major depressive disorder. He opined that a person suffering from dementia when confronted with an unexpected event would have less capacity to come up with novel solutions and less capacity to talk down an emotional reaction to the situation. As he was not able to reason through it, his self-control was impaired. His capacity for self-control reduced as his stress levels rose. 
     
      
    41 I accept on the balance of probabilities that at the time of the commission of the offence the offender had early fronto-temporal dementia and was suffering depression. His depression increased the level of hurt that he experienced over the years as a result of the conduct of the deceased towards him. His belief was that his wife wanted all of his money, that she had been unfaithful to him and did not love him. The offender’s dementia and depression reduced to some degree his capacity for self-control. The immediate trigger for his loss of self-control was the attack by the deceased upon him with the knife.  
     
      
    42 The Crown submitted that the loss of self-control induced by the provocation was of short duration. The Crown argued that thereafter the offender pursued a course of methodical penetrating blows to the head with the skutch hammer which was not committed in a frenzy but was calculated. The Crown cited R v Vella (NSWCCA 15 December 1995, unreported) at p 10 and p 15.  
     
      
    43 The circumstances of this case are different to those in Vella where Mr Vella pursued a long course of methodical bashing which went on for at least a quarter of an hour and the victim was pleading for mercy between the blows: see Vella at p 10. As I have recognized at [7] above all of the struggle between the offender and his wife could not have lasted more than about ten minutes.  
     
      
    44 In the present case, the jury must have found that notwithstanding the extraordinary precision of the six blows that were struck whilst the deceased was on the ground, all six blows were the result of a loss of self-control on the part of the offender that was induced by the deceased’s conduct. A finding that the blows that followed the second blow [the first blow to the deceased who was then on the ground] was not the result of a loss of self-control must necessarily have resulted in a verdict of murder. In any event, I am unable to conclude beyond reasonable doubt in light of the jury’s verdict that any of the six blows were not as a result of loss of self-control induced by provocation.  
     
      
    45 The jury considered that it was a reasonable possibility that the conduct of the deceased was such that it could have induced an ordinary person in the position of the offender to have so far lost self-control as to have formed an intention to kill or to inflict really serious physical injury upon the deceased. The Crown did not prove beyond reasonable doubt that the offender was not acting under provocation when he killed his wife.  
     
      
       
      Substantial impairment by abnormality of mind  
       
      
    46 Although the offender was found guilty of manslaughter on the basis of provocation, it is necessary to consider whether the offender has established more probably than not that at the time of the offence he was substantially impaired by reason of an abnormality of mind. Where both provocation and substantial impairment are present, they can operate together to reduce the objective seriousness of the offence: see R v Low (1991) 57 A Crim R 8; R v Ko [2000] NSWSC 1130. It was not the offender’s case that his capacity to judge whether his actions were right or wrong was substantially impaired. His capacity either to understand events or to control himself at the time of the acts causing death was said to have been substantially impaired by an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition. It was put to me on behalf of the offender that there was no difference between the opinions of the psychiatrists. I do not agree with that submission.  
     
      
    47 Dr Nielssen was of the opinion that the offender’s disorders namely depressive illness, possible delusional disorder and probable early dementia were “an underlying condition within the meaning of s 23A of the Crimes Act”. He stated (report 11 August 2009 p 8): 
     
      
       
        
        “His underlying condition is likely to have given rise to an abnormality of mind at the time of the offence, during which he experienced significant impairment in his perception of the events and his capacity to control his actions. His impairment in the perception of events took the form of his belief that he was in danger from his wife because she wanted his money. The impairment in his capacity to control his actions was due to the combination of his perception of threat from his wife and impaired impulse control arising from frontal lobe dementia.” 
        
       
       
      
    48 In cross-examination during the trial, Dr Nielssen gave the following evidence (T 1082 L 15-27):  
     
      
       
        
         
        “Q. In the last paragraph of your report, do you have it there, page 8?  
        
       
      
     A. Yes. 
     
      
       
        
        Q. My friend took you through that or you read through it. You refer to the impairment as being significant impairment? 
        
       
      
     A. Yes. 
     
      
       
        
        Q. When you were led through that you may have used the word substantial but did you mean significant impairment in the way that it's set out in that last paragraph?  
         
        A. Yes, I was referring to the defence of substantial impairment but my assessment of the level of impairment based on the diagnosis I have made and the effects of those conditions was that it would have been significant.”  
         
        
       
      
    49 The diagnosis of possible delusional disorder by Dr Nielssen was made on the basis of the history by the offender that the deceased had affairs in Lebanon and after she arrived in Australia and the diagnosis of Dr Benjamin. Dr Nielssen acknowledged that an alternative explanation was that the offender’s beliefs were based on real events and the basis of the beliefs might not be delusional. He had not obtained enough detail to confirm whether that might have been the case.  
     
      
    50 On the diagnosis of probable early dementia, Dr Nielssen’s testimony included the following T 1095 L 11- 42:  
     
      
     
     
      
       
        
        “Q. In relation to number 3, which is the probable early dementia, you, am I right, qualify this diagnosis of dementia in two ways: firstly, as early dementia; and, secondly, as probable. Is that a fair statement?  
        
       
      
     A. Yes.  
     
      
       
        
        Q. And by early dementia can one understand there is, let's say, advanced dementia or severe dementia?  
         
        A. Firstly, Mr Gabriel is a young man, he's young to have this kind of disorder. Only 5 per cent of people aged 65 have some evidence of dementia. The diagnosis of a condition like that, it is quite a serious diagnosis, will depend on the amount of disability that it created. In Mr Gabriel's case I'm quite sure that he has an early dementing process, but it is not so severe, for example, that it severely affects his memory function. It mainly affects his executive functions, his frontal lobe functions at this stage.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. And you say I think in your opinion, last paragraph, if I can invite you to look at that at the bottom of page 7, that the diagnosis of probable early dementia is based on Mr Gabriel's performance during the recent interview when he was disorganised in his speech and had difficulty retrieving specific information. Do you see that?  
        
       
      
     A. Yes.   
     
      
       
        
        Q. Am I right in understanding you didn't observe him in court last week over a period of a couple of days giving evidence?  
         
        A. No, I didn't, but I read the transcript. I must say, it was much more concise than was certainly my experience at the initial interview. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Q. In any event, as you say there, your diagnosis was based on his performance during the interview when you saw him and you go on to say that the diagnosis is supported or the clinical impression is supported by the neuropsychological testing?  
        
       
      
     A. Yes.”51 From my observation of the offender, he did not demonstrate during his evidence disorganization of speech or loss of memory function. What he told the jury was markedly coherent. Any lack of recollection was confined to what occurred after he had struck the first blow. The psychiatrists and the psychologist told the jury that such a lack of recollection can occur in very traumatic cases such as the present. Dr Allnutt referred to “social amnesia” where a person defends against remembering the traumatic event. 
     
      
    52 Dr Allnutt opined that there were reasonable grounds “to be of the view that at the material time the alleged offence occurred [the offender] manifested an underlying condition with an abnormality of mind.” On the issue of substantial impairment the views expressed by Dr Allnutt included the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “… his description of the alleged offence suggests that he was impaired but not substantially in his capacity to understand events, that is, that his reasons for holding the belief that his wife was unfaithful and had designs on his personal assets was based in my opinion on understandable premises and interpretation of her behaviours and the nature of interactions that they had had but were probably exaggerated in his own mind. 
        
       
       
        
        If he is regarded as having delusions of infidelity at the time then he would be regarded as significantly compromised in his ability to understand events but only in relation to his wife’s fidelity and her de[s]igns on his assets. Delusions as well as overvalued ideas impair understanding in specific ways not generally. I would not regard him as significantly impaired [in] his capacity to interpret and understand events in this interaction with his wife at the material time of the alleged offence.  
        
       
      
     … 
     
      
       
        
        He had in my opinion, capacity to control his actions in that I do not believe his depression nor dementia was of such a severity or nature that he lost that capacity to a significant degree; your client’s account is that he believed that his life was under threat and that he acted in a manner to defend himself and protect his life.” 
        
       
      
    53 Dr Allnutt was of the opinion that the offender did not have a delusional disorder. The offender’s beliefs about his wife’s infidelity and being used by her in the marriage to get at his money were based on information that the offender provided to him which seemed to Dr Allnutt to be reasonable for his beliefs. He recognized that a decision whether a belief was delusional is difficult especially when talking about beliefs of infidelity. The offender’s evidence during the trial supported Dr Allnutt’s opinion that his beliefs were not delusional. I am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities the offender had a delusional disorder. I accept, however, Dr Allnutt’s opinion that whether the offender’s beliefs were delusional or rationally based, the emotional impact was the same. He had early fronto-temporal dementia and depression which are underlying conditions.  
     
      
    54 Ultimately neither of the psychiatrists expressed the opinion that the offender’s capacity either to understand events or to control himself at the time of the offence was substantially impaired. Dr Nielssen considered the offender’s impairment was significant whereas Dr Allnutt did not regard him as being impaired to such a degree. There is little in the evidence which demonstrates that notwithstanding his beliefs and the arguments with his wife, the offender had difficulty with the capacity to control himself prior to the attack upon him with the knife. The telephone call made by the offender to his solicitor very shortly after the commission of the offence provides support for Dr Allnutt’s opinion that the offender’s capacity to understand events was not significantly impaired.  
     
      
    55 I prefer Dr Allnutt’s opinion as to the degree of the offender’s impairment.  
     
      
    56 Whilst I accept that there was some impairment in the offender’s capacity to understand events and to control himself by an abnormality of mind arising from the underlying conditions of early fronto-temporal dementia and depression, I am not satisfied that it was more likely than not that at the time of the offence he was substantially impaired.  
     
      
       
      Further findings of fact  
       
      
    57 The Crown submitted that I should find that the offender, after inflicting the injuries, and where it was apparent that the deceased was alive, repositioned her body, did not call for an ambulance, did not render assistance to her and ignored any prospect that the deceased’s life could be saved.  
     
      
    58 I find beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did interfere with the scene of the crime at some time between the telephone call to his solicitor and the arrival of police officers Williams and Smith at the home at 3.20pm. The only rational inference to be drawn from the deceased’s injuries and the spatter staining on the garage floor is that the six blows were struck whilst her head was on the floor in the vicinity of where the skutch hammer was found by the police officers. I am satisfied from the swipe pattern leading from where the hair was located on the floor towards the area of clotted blood and the deceased’s position when seen by the police officers that the offender moved his wife north to where the clotted blood and vomit were located.  
     
      
    59 I accept Detective Sergeant Gibbs’s opinion that the absence of blood spatter on the knife indicated that it would not have been in the position that it was found by police at the time the spatter was occurring. I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender moved the knife to that position. The Crown did not submit during the proceedings on sentence nor am I satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender interfered with the scene in an attempt to cover up his crime.  
     
      
    60 As to the Crown’s contention that the offender did not call an ambulance and render assistance to the deceased, the offender told the jury that when Vanessa was at the front door he said to her “please go and get help. Please ring the ambulance.” He testified that he rang Castle Hill police station and was speaking to someone at the station when he heard police at the front door. He then hung the telephone up and spoke to them. However, Vanessa’s testimony of the conversation did not include her father asking her to ring an ambulance. She recounted that he said to her “Just get help, just go, just get help, just leave, Ness, get help”. On neither version of the conversation did the offender tell his daughter that the deceased was seriously injured or injured at all. The phone records (exhibit O) do not disclose that a telephone call was made to Castle Hill police station. Constable Smith testified that when he was near the front door he heard a male voice inside the house say “police please.” He called out loudly “Police” and heard a plastic clicking noise that sounded like a telephone being hung up. The offender then came to the front door.  
     
      
    61 I do not accept that the offender asked his daughter to ring an ambulance. In any event, it was open to him to do so himself. The telephone call to his solicitor shortly after Vanessa left, the offender said, was not about triple 0. He had returned to the garage and turned on the light prior to making that call. He had seen his wife on the ground with blood on her. It would have been evident that she was alive. When Constable Smith saw the deceased, he described hearing her “taking deep, rasping breaths” and whilst she did so “her back was rising and falling, heaving up and down”. Whilst the offender may have attempted to speak to police at Castle Hill police station, such an attempt was not made until about 3.20pm. I conclude that the offender’s conduct demonstrated self-interest and remarkable indifference to obtaining help for his wife.  
     
      
    62 As in all offences of manslaughter the starting point in the present sentencing exercise is that the life of Wadad Isber aged 46 years has been unlawfully taken: see R v Blacklidge (NSWCCA 12 December 1995, unreported). The crime of manslaughter involves the felonious taking of human life and has always been recognised by the law as a most serious crime: R v MacDonald (NSWCCA 12 December 1995, unreported). The maximum sentence for the crime of manslaughter is 25 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    63 The degree of provocation offered to the offender cumulatively over the years by the deceased was not to my mind of a high order. The offender’s underlying conditions, however, increased his negative perception of his wife’s conduct and the hurt that he experienced. The provocation was materially heightened when the deceased placed the knife to the offender’s throat. This was followed shortly thereafter by the loss of self-control. Tragically but for the introduction of the knife into the argument, the manslaughter would not have occurred. These are considerations, in my opinion, which reduce the objective gravity of the offence: R v Alexander (1994) 78 A Crim R 141 at 144.  
     
      
    64 The offender ferociously struck his wife six times with the skutch hammer to the head whilst she lay unconscious on the ground. He intended to kill her. Dr Pitham was of the opinion that each of the three blows that penetrated the brain all the way into its centre would likely to have been fatal. Of the remaining four blows that penetrated the skull but did not enter the deep substance of the brain, Dr Pitham said it was probable that the patient would have survived if one of those injuries had happened in isolation but each such injury would have caused a substantial degree of brain damage. No medical intervention, he said, could have saved the deceased even though she survived for seven days. The degree of violence displayed by the offender was extreme. These are considerations which, in my opinion, increase the objective seriousness of the offence: Alexander; R v KMB [2005] NSWCCA 185 at [11].  
     
      
    65 The Crown invites me to find that an aggravating factor was the use of a weapon: s 21A(2)(c) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Mr Dailly on the other hand submits that the skutch hammer was not a weapon obtained by the offender in order to commit the offence but was picked up by him in self-defence. Whilst that is so, the offender continued to use the weapon after the need for self-defence had passed. The use of the skutch hammer, an awful implement, in the infliction of the six blows is a factor of aggravation.  
     
      
    66 Another factor of aggravation the Crown put to me was the commission of the offence in the home of the victim: s 21A(eb) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  Mr Dailly argued that because the deceased created the violent and threatening situation in her home, this factor of aggravation should not be found. With this submission I agree. Section 21A(eb) was introduced to preserve the notion of sanctity of the home. Sadly, the deceased’s reasonable expectation of safety and security in the matrimonial home was displaced when she introduced the knife. In the present case, I do not consider that this aggravating factor applies.  
     
      
    67 As I have found at [41] above, the offender had early fronto-temporal dementia and was suffering depression at the time of the commission of the offence. In addition to increasing the offender’s negative perceptions and level of hurt, I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that these conditions to a limited degree reduced his capacity for self-control when the deceased attacked him with the knife. The offender’s moral culpability for his offending is diminished by reason of his dementia and depression and the objective seriousness of the offence is mitigated by the presence of these conditions: s 21A(3)(j) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act; R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [33] – [36], R v Israil [2002] NSWCCA 255 at [23]. 
     
      
    68 It is a factor in mitigation that the offence was neither premeditated nor planned: s 21A(3)(b) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    69 The offender was born on 11 February 1945 and is almost 65 years old. At the time of the offence, he was 62 years old. He does not have any prior criminal convictions which entitles him to leniency: s 21A(3)(e) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. The offender did not give evidence during the proceedings on sentence. I have summarised the offender’s personal circumstances at [16-17] above. A character testimonial by Joseph Saad the offender’s nephew refers to the offender as being “an extremely hard working family man with deep Christian convictions”. Morris Saad makes reference to the offender working “extremely hard”. I accept that the offender has been a hard worker all his life which is demonstrated by the successful business which he established in Sydney as a stonemason. I find that prior to the manslaughter, the offender was a person of good character: s 21A(3)(f) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    70 A mitigating factor to be taken into account in determining an appropriate sentence is the remorse shown by the offender for the offence. Section 21A(3)(i) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act provides that remorse may only be taken into account if: 
     
      
       
        
        “(i) the offender has provided evidence that he …has accepted responsibility for his … actions, and  
        
       
       
        
        (ii) the offender has acknowledged any injury, loss or damage caused by his …actions or made reparation for such injury, loss or damage (or both)”. 
        
       
      
    71 The offender has by his plea of guilty to manslaughter accepted responsibility for his actions and the plea is an indication of his remorse and contrition. The Crown case on manslaughter was, however, very strong. His plea of guilty was, in my opinion, a recognition of the inevitable. The strength of the Crown case, I emphasise, is relevant only to the evaluation of remorse: R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA at [12]. 
     
      
    72 A troublesome feature in assessing whether the offender is remorseful is the indifference to his wife which he displayed between the commission of the offence and the arrival of police. During submissions on sentence, Mr Dailly pointed to the offender’s testimony during the trial that he loved his wife and still did as demonstrating remorse. The offender’s commitment to her was demonstrated by the agreement to purchase a house in Lebanon and to live there and by the payment of significant amounts of money. Notwithstanding, that evidence by itself does not fulfil the requirements of s 21A(3)(i)(i)-(ii). Morris Saad, however, writes in his character testimonial that he has visited the offender regularly during his time in custody. He states: “Harb and I have had long chats about his life after the incident. I can honestly say that on each occasion we have spoken since this incident, Harb has expressed his sincere regret and deep remorse for the incident. Harb “tells me that he misses Wadad and that all he ever wanted was to live with her in a happy peaceful environment…” Joseph Saad refers to the offender often speaking to him about missing the deceased and “how he was willing to give up everything for her, and how he would do anything to have her back.” 
     
      
    73 I am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the offender has accepted responsibility for his actions and has acknowledged the loss that he has caused. I am satisfied that he is remorseful for his offending.  
     
      
    74 I conclude on the balance of probabilities that he is unlikely to re-offend and has good prospects of rehabilitation: s 21A(3)(g)-(h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    75 Such a manslaughter in a domestic setting would usually call for a strong element of general deterrence in the sentence. But in this case, the part played by the offender’s depression and dementia in the commission of the offence diminishes the weight to be given to this factor. I do not overlook the offender’s failure to take the medication for his depression which was prescribed by Dr Benjamin. I do not consider, however, that this is a case where the failure to take prescribed medication reduces – if not eradicates - the mitigation which would otherwise be given for a mental condition: see R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 52. The offender’s depression and dementia render him to be an inappropriate medium for general deterrence and I give little weight to this factor: Hemsley; R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67 at 71. The Crown does not suggest nor do I find that there is any risk of future dangerousness which increases the need for protection of the public.  
     
      
    76 I take into account the offender’s age and state of health. The offender gave evidence of experiencing hallucinations of voices and of the medication he takes for depression, for an ulcer and for [high] cholesterol. It appears, however, that the offender’s depressive illness is in remission as a result of treatment with anti-depressant medication. Whilst there is a risk of further episodes of depression, adequate treatment is available to him in custody.  
     
      
    77 A difficult question is the probable course of the offender’s dementia. In a report dated 18 November 2009, Dr Nielssen states that “the prognosis of Mr Gabriel’s dementia, which is probably a form of vascular dementia is less certain.” Dementia is an irreversible and progressive condition and Dr Nielssen observes that “it is unusual not to have progressed to needing care within a few years of diagnosis. A recent estimate of the median survival after the diagnosis of vascular dementia is 3.3 years.”   
     
      
    78 Neither Dr Allnutt nor Dr McMahon diagnosed probable vascular dementia. Dr McMahon was of the opinion that the offender’s dementia “had its onset in the early nineteen nineties”. In a report dated 24 June 2009, Dr McMahon states at p 22:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        In the mid to long term, that is beyond 3 to 5 years, he will most probably require increased structure and support to meet activities of daily living. Fronto-temporal dementias typically have a rapid course of decline in the later stages, and in the long term beyond 8 to 10 years he will likely require significant support to meet his activities of daily living.” 
        
       
      
    79 The offender, it seems, has not been referred to a gerontologist. No formal diagnosis of vascular dementia has been made. On the present state of the evidence, I am unable to conclude on the balance of probabilities that the offender has vascular dementia.  
     
      
    80 When considering the probable rate of the offender’s cognitive loss, I am mindful that the offender’s testimony during the trial neither reflected disorganisation of speech nor loss of memory function. I note that when the offender was further interviewed by Dr Nielssen, the psychiatrist considered that the offender “was able to answer the additional questions put to him in a succinct way, when compared to his performance conducted earlier in the year.” 
     
      
    81 It is not possible to determine what will be the rate of decline in his cognitive abilities. Nevertheless, I accept that his dementia will progress so that he will eventually require significant support. Dr Nielssen recounted that the New South Wales prison system does not currently have facilities that can provide such a level of care. Whilst it is not presently the case that the dementia and depression renders imprisonment more burdensome to the offender than for the average prisoner, I take into account that the burden will increase during any journey of cognitive decline: Hemsley; Israil at [26]. This is a special circumstance justifying a departure from the statutory proportion between the non-parole period and the balance of term. A special circumstance is his first time in custody at the age of 62 years.  
     
      
    82 Various cases were cited by counsel during submissions. One of the cases to which my attention was drawn by Mr Dailly was R v Zeilaa [2009] NSWSC 532. In that case the term of the non-parole period set by Howie J was 2 years 6 months. Senior Counsel submits that a non-parole period of between 2 and 3 years would be an appropriate sentence in the present case. A distinguishing feature of Zeilaa is that it was accepted that Mr Zeilaa was substantially impaired due to the effects of dementia. The sentencing judge stressed at [22] – [23] that the sentence was “a very peculiar sentence imposed in circumstances of a very unusual case.”  The non-parole period put to me by Mr Dailly would not, to my mind, adequately reflect the objective seriousness of the offence. However, the cases cited by counsel and the sentencing statistics provided to me have been of assistance in determining the appropriate sentence. Each case depends on its own facts.  
     
      
    83 Although mitigated by the considerations of self-defence, provocation, the underlying conditions and subjective circumstances which I have detailed, the taking by the offender of his wife’s life is a serious crime. She suffered a horrible death.  
     
      
    84 The plea of guilty to manslaughter was entered when the offender was arraigned on 29 September 2009, the date on which the trial had originally been listed to commence. It had been anticipated that pre-trial issues would be raised and a jury panel was not required until 6 October 2009. On that day, the offender pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter in the presence of the jury panel which plea the Crown did not accept in full discharge of the indictment. Mr Dailly submits that the offender should receive a substantial discount for his plea. The offender’s plea which was rejected by the Crown is consistent with the jury verdict. If the plea had been accepted, its utilitarian value would, in my opinion, have been limited as it came at a late stage. Mr Dailly referred to difficulties in obtaining instructions because of the offender’s dementia. It seems, however, that it was never really in issue that the offender would plead guilty to manslaughter in some form yet an indication of such a plea was not provided to the Crown until shortly before it was entered. I have difficulty understanding how in the case of this offender, his dementia prohibited such an indication being given. The court history (exhibit B) details what had occurred in the proceedings before the plea was entered. I do not consider, in the present case, the reasons advanced for the delay in the plea as a matter of fairness impact upon the assessment of its utilitarian value: R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102; R v Zeilaa at [18]. The offender is entitled to a discount for the utilitarian effect of his plea of 10 per cent.  
     
      
    85 Mr Dailly submitted that the sentence should be mitigated by reason of “extra-curial punishment” as the deceased was a prominent figure in his life and in his plans for a life in retirement. It is submitted that, now his wife is gone, there is little left for him to look forward to. I reject this submission. This is not a case where there is a loss or detriment imposed on the offender by persons other than this court for the purpose of punishing him for his crime: Silvano v R (2008) 184 A Crim 593. What is said to be the offender’s loss is an inevitable consequence of his having committed the offence. I give no weight in the present circumstances to extra curial punishment.  
     
      
    86 A victim impact statement written by Nahla Makdissi at the request of members of the deceased’s family was tendered. The contents of the statement cannot be used by me to increase the offender’s sentence: R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76. I acknowledge the grief and distress of the deceased’s family and express on the community’s behalf its sympathy and compassion for them.  
     
      
    87 There is no alternative to a full time term of imprisonment being imposed. The offender has been in custody since 21 January 2008. Accordingly, the sentence will commence on that date.  
     
      
    88 I consider that the appropriate undiscounted starting point of the sentence is 10 years 4 months. The term of the sentence is reduced by 10 per cent for the utilitarian effect of the plea to 9 years 3 months (rounded down). Special circumstances have been found.  
     
      
    89 Harb Gabriel, I convict you. I sentence you to imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years 3 months which is to commence on 21 January 2008 and is to expire on 20 April 2014. I set a balance of term of 3 years which is to commence on 21 April 2014 and will expire on 20 April 2017. 
     
      
    90 You will be eligible to be released to parole on 20 April 2014.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: The applicant was sentenced in the District Court by Hulme DCJ (as his Honour then was) for a number of dishonesty offences. He had pleaded guilty to two counts of robbery, one count of larceny from the person and one count of robbery while armed with a dangerous weapon. In respect of that last offence the Judge was asked to take into account a further five matters on a Form 1: being two offences of larceny from the person; an offence of armed robbery; an offence of robbery; and an offence of drive conveyance without consent. 
     
      
    4 Each of the offences on the indictment, except that in the fourth count, carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 14 years. The fourth count carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    5 On 14 March 2008 the applicant was sentenced to a total effective term of 11 years with an overall non-parole period of 8 years 3 months. The sentences were dated from 12 November 2007, the date upon which the pleas of guilty were entered, and the applicant is eligible for release to parole on 31 January 2016. 
     
      
    6 The applicant was unrepresented before this Court. He had filed grounds and written submissions with the Registrar prior to the hearing. He placed further written material and made oral submissions before the Court at the hearing. He appeared to be intelligent and articulate. 
     
      
    7 The first count related to a robbery committed on a pharmacy on 27 September 2006. The applicant waited until the cash register was opened and attempted to snatch notes from the drawer. The pharmacist closed the drawer trapping the applicant’s hand. He threatened the pharmacist with his other fist and the till was opened. The applicant escaped with $450. 
     
      
    8 The next offence was a stealing from the person taken into account on the Form 1. On 29 September the applicant entered a pharmacy. He waited until the till was opened and then went to the staff side of the counter ordering the persons to “stand back”. He then took $260 in cash from the till. 
     
      
    9 The third offence was committed on 7 October and was an armed robbery taken into account on the Form 1. The applicant armed with a rifle entered a service station and threatened to shoot the attendant and a member of the public unless he was given money. He received $400. 
     
      
    10 The fourth offence was a stealing from the person taken into account on the Form 1. On 8 October the applicant entered a grocery store. He proffered $10 to purchase a chocolate bar and, when the till was opened, grabbed all of the $50 notes before fleeing from the store. He stole about $1,500. 
     
      
    11 The fifth offence was a robbery taken into account on the Form 1. On 28 October the applicant entered a supermarket. He waited for the till to be opened. He then pushed the attendant aside and grabbed notes from the till. He stole about $500. 
     
      
    12 Count 2 on the indictment was a robbery that took place on 29 October. The applicant entered a gourmet food store and proffered a $10 dollar note for the purchase of a soft drink. When the till was opened he attempted to grab the tray but was prevented by the attendant. However the applicant managed to grab about $80 in notes before running from the store. 
     
      
    13 Count 3 on the indictment was a stealing from the person that occurred on 30 October. The applicant was present in a supermarket and, when the attendant opened the till, he reached into it and withdrew about $350 before leaving the store. 
     
      
    14 Count 4 on the indictment occurred on 31 October 2006. The applicant and a co-offender entered a bank. The applicant was armed with a black replica pistol and the co-offender with a rifle. The applicant approached a teller and handed her a bag. He told her that he would shoot her unless she filled it with money. She was also told to obtain money from a neighbouring teller. Cash amounting to $9,490 was placed in the bag. In addition the teller planted two dye bombs in the bag. As the applicant and his co-offender left the bank, the dye bombs exploded, staining some of the money, the applicant’s clothing and the pistol. The police had been intercepting calls made by the applicant and heard him make statements implicating himself in the robbery. He was later arrested and was in possession of money and other objects stained with dye. 
     
      
    15 It should be noted that this is another case where a serious matter was inappropriately placed onto a Form 1 with the result that the judge could not impose a sentence to reflect the seriousness of that offence: see Eedens v R [2009] NSWCCA 254. This Court has been critical of this practice and has reminded judges of their power to reject a Form 1 which contains inappropriate matters: CP v R [2009] NSWCCA 291. Obviously the offence in the fourth count was the most serious matter for which the applicant was before the court. However, the next most serious offence was clearly the robbery on 7 October where the applicant was armed with a rifle. This offence, although contained on a Form 1, was substantially more serious than each of the first three offences on the indictment, which were in effect snatching money from a till. 
     
      
    16 At the hearing of the application the applicant indicated that he no longer relied upon four of the eight complaints he had raised in his earlier written submissions. The remaining complaints were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The discount given for the pleas of guilty was inadequate. 
         
         
        4. The failure of the sentencing judge to take into account “that corrective services had a duty of care to rehabilitate me after 8½ years in ‘E maximum’ but did not and released from maximum security with $420, into the community”. 
         
         
        6. The sentencing judge “was blinded by my past sentence and simply took that as a guideline for sentence”. 
         
         
        8. The sentencing judge imposed “an over bearing and crushing sentence”. 
        
       
      
    17 The applicant had little in his subjective circumstances that could assist him. He was born on 16 October 1966 and hence was 41 years at the date of sentence. He has a criminal record dating from 1985 for dishonesty and drug offences. He was first sentenced to imprisonment in 1995. In 1998 he was sentenced in the District Court for 5 offences of robbery in company to a minimum term of 7 years with an additional term of 3 years. The minimum term expired on 15 May 2005. The applicant unsuccessfully sought leave to appeal against these sentences: see [2000] NSWCCA 481. He later received a sentence for escape with a non-parole period to expire on 8 July 2006. The applicant was on parole from these sentences when he committed the offences for which Hulme DCJ sentenced him. His parole was revoked on 16 November 2006 and he was to serve a balance of parole to expire on 9 July 2008. 
     
      
    18 The applicant gave evidence on sentence. He expressed remorse for the offences and their effect on the victims. He gave the following history: 
     
      
       
        
         
        My upbringing from a Catholic upbringing, my father was very strict, ex-military man. My mother suffered a stroke when I was four years old and by the age of ten being the youngest child in the family - palliative was the utmost thing was to look after my mum. I didn't have a normal upbringing due to the fact that wherever my dad took my mum overseas to see doctors overseas to try and help her with her condition I was there with them all the time. So I attended numerous schools overseas as well as here and that was in the ten year period your Honour that I had to not only endure seeing my mum but not hearing her was another strange - you know strange part of my upbringing because my sister started to bring me up instead of my mum because she was so sick. But our main concern was my mother and to look after her and I’ve have been doing it for the last 30 odd years and she passed away last year, I lost mum. I wasn't allowed to attend her funeral being in Lithgow Gaol at the time and I lost my father 20 odd years ago as well. 
         
        
       
      
    19 The applicant explained that his E classification in the prison system as a result of his escape offence restricted his ability to undergo rehabilitation while serving his sentence. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It’s halted, or it did halt my further advancement to rehabilitation because I put in so many submissions prior to my release and there was a criteria followed by the Department that you had to do certain courses to get works release. I did that and some, with two TAFE courses and when it came up for time to review because it was being five years since then, no reason was given for the fact that I couldn't be given works release. They had to review it and at one time an officer said it sat in the pigeonhole for three months, no one looked at it. I couldn't receive works release and every time I asked they said well it's too late now, so it kept on going, they kept telling me to do this, do this course, do that course, and we will give it to you but in the end I just got laughed at. 
        
       
      
    20 The applicant was asked to explain the absence of works release upon his rehabilitation and he stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Your Honour I would say this honestly, if I had the chance for works release because I was working at the time of the gaol I don't think I would have done what I done, I know it might sound the wrong thing to say but I had the opportunity, I asked for the opportunity, it wasn't by chance. I did everything right, I complied, I haven't had a gaol charge in eight years, not a blemish. On works release I would have saved money because they do hold your money while you work and they pay your rent and I assume that I wouldn't have ended up in the predicament that I did if I had been given works release, so I was denied that as well. I am not laying blame on the Department but I would say that they had a hand in you know my rehabilitation but they didn't extend that hand. 
        
       
      
    21 The applicant also complained about his treatment by the Parole Board. He stated that instead of being assisted to find work he was sent for rehabilitation for his back injury, something that should have been done while he was in custody. He had work lined up on his release but the Parole Board told him to seek rehabilitation for his back injury. He also complained that he was not allocated a permanent parole officer. 
     
      
    22 The sentencing Judge stated that he was “not very impressed” with the applicant’s evidence and formed the impression that the applicant was not sincere. He found his professed remorse “was far from heartfelt”. He also felt that the applicant “was prepared to make any excuse rather than to acknowledge his own shortcomings and accept responsibility”. 
     
      
    23 On the hearing of the application before this Court the applicant tendered a certificate indicating that he had chronic hepatitis C. He also tendered a letter written by him to the Court in which he sought to appeal to the Court’s “altruistic side and compassion” in reviewing his history. In it he stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Prior to my incarceration, I held the position of Civil Engineer, for State Rail Authority for a period of 10 years - during which I was responsible for oversight of 20 members under my direct report. During this time, I was able to demonstrate good leadership skills, ethical standards and exercised the protocol and procedures of the department for which I worked through my daily work. 
         
         
        In the community, I was an active participant in Bankstown Community Centre, assisting with the elderly and disabled people, only because my poor mother was a paraplegic and a mute for over 40 years. My mother was my priority after my father passed away, and now my mother has past two years ago now. I supported her for most of my life. I drove members around in the community bus, as rostered, to the local community centres, RSL’s etc, to ensure they participated actively and often. 
         
         
        During the course of my incarceration, I have been entrusted to hold positions such as clerical support, sweeper, and have attended all programs required of me. 
         
         
        …………… 
         
         
        The purpose of my letter is appealing the sentence on severity. Your Honour, I feel that at this point in my life and my age, I would like to be given an opportunity simply because I have always spent my incarceration in maximum security and not given the chance to progress my classification status by the Department. 
         
         
        As it stands now that I have enquired about my rehabilitation and to progress to a minimum security gaol is ideal at the moment, such as ""works release"". Suffice to say that timing is crucial because I do not wish to walk out when I am 50 years of age and have had no chance of employment. The sentence is obviously crushing and overbearing in my opinion. If I have any chance in life it is in your hands to give me the opportunity to be successful in my future endeavours, as I had demonstrated previously. 
        
       
      
    24 The applicant also placed into evidence in this Court a statement from an alcohol and drug counsellor at the Long Bay Complex to the effect that the applicant has attended group and individual counselling. It contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        My experience of [the applicant] in his first session was that of a man who was extremely disempowered through his own anger and resentments. He saw himself as a victim of the system and was generally very lost and unhappy. Throughout the counselling process [the applicant] has made significant changes to the point where he no longer sees himself as the victim and has taken big steps and moving forward and taking responsibility for himself. [The applicant] has demonstrated a serious effort to rehabilitate himself and address his behaviours. He has shown he is developing insights into his lifestyle and issues that contribute to his offences. This is evidenced in his consistent attendance and attitude towards the counselling process. 
         
         
        His throughcare plan upon release is also developing and he has indicated he is willing to attend programs and support that is available to him. [The applicant] has also stated he will continue counselling and attend a self help support group, Narcotics Anonymous. He has stated that these will play a big part in his efforts to remain drug-free and continue his recovery from drug addiction and criminal behaviours. 
        
       
      
    25 The applicant’s first complaint is about the level of discount given to him for his plea of guilty. In his remarks his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The offender's pleas of guilty were entered on the day his matter was listed for trial. I was informed that serious discussions about the disposition of the matter commenced about two months before the trial date. Whilst I accept that the pleas came after the Crown had determined to take no further proceedings in respect of some charges for which the offender has been committed for trial, the fact remains that it was open to him to plead guilty to the subject offences at any time. The Crown was aware, however, before the actual day of trial that pleas were going to be entered. Weighing all of this I regard it as appropriate to recognise the utilitarian benefit of the pleas brought to the criminal justice system by discounting the sentences to be imposed by 12.5 per cent. It will be a little more in respect of counts 1 to 3 because there will be some slight rounding down in the offender's favour to produce a practical result. 
        
       
      
    26 There is no error of principle in this passage of the sentencing remarks and the discount was completely appropriate. The applicant’s complaint is based upon the fact that his co-offender in some matters received a discount of 25 per cent. But there is no issue of parity in this regard and, in any event, the co-offender pleaded guilty in the Local Court and, therefore, qualified for a discount at the top of the range. 
     
      
    27 The second complaint is really based upon what the applicant considered to be unfair treatment by the prison authorities in failing to give him the opportunity for works release. There is no merit in this complaint nor did his imprisonment history have any significant bearing upon the appropriate sentence to be imposed upon him. The applicant had escaped from custody and, therefore, was subject to more stringent custodial arrangements. That was a matter completely within the discretion of the custodial authorities. In any event, as his Honour noted, the applicant is prepared to blame others for his predicament and does not accept responsibility for his own conduct. Yet he is old enough and intelligent enough to make his own decisions about his conduct in the community. It was clearly an aggravating factor that the applicant was on parole and there was no mitigation in his custodial history or the conditions imposed upon him by the Parole Board. 
     
      
    28 The third complaint is that the Judge sentenced the applicant because of his past record. He was entitled to take into account as an aggravating factor the applicant’s prior criminal conduct in the sense that it indicated both general and specific deterrence were matters of substantial importance in determining the appropriate sentence to impose upon him consistent with the extent of his criminality revealed by the matters for which he was being sentenced. There is nothing in the sentencing remarks to suggest any error in the approach of the sentencing judge in exercising his discretion. 
     
      
    29 The final complaint is in effect that the sentence is manifestly excessive. It may seem to be a crushing one to the applicant but it was a sentence appropriate to his criminality in light of his record and his subjective matters that were of little significance having regard to his age and his breach of parole. As I have indicated, the applicant was fortunate to have a very serious matter placed upon a Form 1 in what appears to have been some plea bargain with the prosecution. That was an inappropriate course and as a result the applicant received a sentence that was less than his over-all criminality deserved. 
     
      
    30 Ultimately the applicant’s plea to this Court was to have the sentence reduced to give him an earlier opportunity for works release and release to parole. To that end he sought to have the court leave the overall term of the sentence undisturbed but to reduce the overall non-parole period by 2 years.  
     
      
    31 In my opinion there is no basis for the Court intervening to achieve that result. This Court must find error by the Judge in the exercise of his discretion. I do not believe there was any. The applicant’s sentence was made cumulative by 12 months on his balance of parole. This was a very fair result. In the end the applicant is serving a total period in custody of 12 years with a minimum period to be served of 9 year 3 months. That means that the minimum period is slightly over the statutory relationship set out in s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. But there was no warrant for a finding of special circumstances and there is no reason for this Court to reduce the non-parole period set by his Honour, and certainly a reduction of 2 years could not be justified. 
     
      
    32 In my opinion the Court should order that the application for leave is granted but the appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: The appeal in this matter was allowed at the hearing before this Court last November and the Court indicated its intention to quash the appellant’s convictions. The Court reserved its reasons and also reserved the question as to what further order should be made. I agree that the orders should be those proposed by Howie J. 
     
      
    2 Pursuant to s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), the Court, if it allows an appeal against conviction, “shall … quash the conviction and direct a judgment and verdict of acquittal to be entered”: s 6(2). That obligation is, however, subject to “the special provisions of this Act”. Section 7 of the Act refers to the powers of the Court “in special cases”. That section provides power for the Court, for example, to substitute a verdict: s 7(2). It is clearly a “special provision”. 
     
      
    3 Section 8 of the Criminal Appeal Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        8 Power of court to grant new trial 
         
          
          (1) On an appeal against a conviction on indictment, the court may, either of its own motion, or on the application of the appellant, order a new trial in such manner as it thinks fit, if the court considers that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, and, that having regard to all the circumstances, such miscarriage of justice can be more adequately remedied by an order for a new trial than by any other order which the court is empowered to make.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    4 The formulation of these various provisions reflects more of the history of the development of criminal appeals than an attempt to provide an orderly statement of the jurisdiction of the Court and its powers. Nevertheless, it has been accepted that s 8 is a “special provision” for the purposes of s 6, and that a new trial is appropriately ordered on the application of the Director. 
     
      
    5 In King v The Queen [1986] HCA 59; 161 CLR 423, Murphy J, dissenting, stated that a new trial “should only be ordered where it would more adequately remedy the miscarriage of justice than any other order the court is empowered to make” and that the “onus rests squarely on the prosecution to show the court that a new trial is the most appropriate remedy”: at 426. Dawson J noted that the section laid down the conditions for its own application and that it conferred a broad discretion: at 433. 
     
      
    6 The approach of Murphy J has not been followed. For example, in Spies v The Queen [2000] HCA 43; 201 CLR 603 a new trial was ordered despite the fact that the appellant had already served the sentence for the particular offence and that it was “unthinkable” that, if convicted, he would receive any additional punishment. The joint judgment (Gaudron, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ) stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “[103] … That being so, it seems prima facie oppressive to put the appellant to the expense and worry of another trial which, on the evidence of the previous trial, is likely to take about ten days. On the other hand, the case against the appellant … seems a strong one. If this Court were now to refuse to order a new trial of that charge, the appellant would be acquitted of all charges. In addition, members of the commercial community as well as the general public have a vital interest in ensuring that directors who abuse their office and breach the criminal or company law do not escape conviction.” 
        
       
       
        
        [104] Unless the interests of justice require the entry of an acquittal, an appellate court should ordinarily order a new trial of a charge where a conviction in respect of that charge has been set aside but there is evidence to support the charge. In the present case, given the competing considerations, it cannot be said that the interests of justice require that the appellant be acquitted …. That being so, it is a matter for the prosecuting authority to determine whether in all the circumstances there should be a further trial ….” 
        
       
      
    7 One question raised by these provisions is whether this Court is limited to the alternative of directing an acquittal or ordering a new trial. An intermediate possibility may be to quash a conviction and leave it to the Director of Public Prosecutions to determine whether to place the appellant before a jury for a second trial. Gerakiteys v The Queen [1984] HCA 8; 153 CLR 317 appears to be authority for the proposition that such a course was available and that this Court need not direct a verdict of acquittal in circumstances where it was inappropriate to order a new trial. 
     
      
    8 However, this Court has explained a number of cases, including Fowler (see below) in the High Court, where an appeal was allowed and a conviction quashed, but no new trial ordered or verdict of acquittal directed, as involving in each case an “oversight”: Regina v Pedrana [2001] NSWCCA 66; 123 A Crim R 1 at [71]-[77] (Ipp AJA, Wood CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing). 
     
      
    9 It is well-established that a new trial should not be ordered if the evidence presented to the jury on the first trial was inadequate to support a conviction: Andrews v The Queen [1968] HCA 84; 126 CLR 198 at 211; Director of Public Prosecutions (Nauru) v Fowler [1984] HCA 48; 154 CLR 627 at 630. 
     
      
    10 Where the evidence satisfies the test of sufficiency, the discretionary power to grant a new trial is properly engaged. As explained by O’Connor J in Peacock v The King [1911] HCA 66; 13 CLR 619 at 675: 
     
      
       
        
        “In exercising the discretion given by the Statute the interests, not only of the prisoner, but of the efficient administration of justice ought to be considered, always providing that no injustice is done to the accused. In this case there was … ample evidence to justify a verdict of guilty, if the jury thought fit to come to that finding on the evidence. If it were not for the misdirection as to the prisoner's statement, the verdict of the jury could not in my opinion have been disturbed.” 
        
       
      
    11 A similar approach was adopted by the High Court in Fowler at 630. That course should be applied in the present circumstances. For the reasons given by Howie J, there was evidence which would, absent the misdirection, have entitled the jury to convict. 
     
      
    12 The power being properly engaged, it is necessary to consider whether other factors militate for or against such an order. First, although there has been a significant lapse of time since the offences were committed, that did not render the initial trial unfair to the appellant and similarly would not preclude him properly being put before a second jury. 
     
      
    13 Secondly, by the time of his release on bail, the appellant had served a little more than 18 months of his sentence and had a little less than a year to serve of his non-parole period on count 1. The sentence on count 3 was cumulative by a period of six months and he had, accordingly, served a little over a year of the non-parole period of two years, six months imposed with respect to count 3. In each case there remained a balance of term of two years which, in relation to count 3 would have expired on 22 April 2013. 
     
      
    14 The fact that a significant part of the sentence on each count has been served is a factor weighing against the order of a retrial: see The Queen v Taufahema [2007] HCA 11; 228 CLR 232 at [55] (Gummow, Hayne, Heydon and Crennan JJ). However, as explained in Spies, even completion of the sentence is not conclusive against an order for a new trial. 
     
      
    15 Thirdly, the first trial was brief, the evidence being completed within two days, and any retrial may be expected to be of similar duration. 
     
      
    16 Fourthly, in some circumstances it may be relevant to inquire as to whether the error at the first trial was one for which the prosecution was responsible: Taufahema at [51]. Although there was debate between the trial judge and counsel as to the legal requirements relating to jury directions, this is not a case in which responsibility for error should be apportioned or treated as significant. There is a material difference between the circumstance which arises where the prosecution has deliberately presented a case on an erroneous basis and one where a legal question has been wrongly decided, resulting in a misdirection. In the former case, as Taufahema illustrates, there is a real risk that the Director is seeking a retrial in order to run a different case, in itself a highly relevant factor. 
     
      
    17 Fifthly, it has been treated as a relevant consideration militating against an order for a retrial that the appellant has been released from custody following a successful appeal: Taufahema at [55], referring to Everett v The Queen [1994] HCA 49; 181 CLR 295 at 302, although the Court was there dealing with a discretionary decision to grant leave to the prosecution to appeal against inadequacy of sentence. It is doubtful whether this factor is entitled to great weight, although it might be an element of potential prejudice to the appellant in having to face the stress and ordeal of a second trial. 
     
      
    18 Finally, it should be noted that the transitional provision of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), discussed by Howie J, will have the effect that the direction required by Longman v The Queen [1989] HCA 60; 168 CLR 79 would operate in a new trial, as it should have operated in the first trial. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
      
    19 An order for a new trial under s 8 is supported by the following factors: 
     
      
       
      (a) the case presented at the first trial was one on which a jury, properly instructed, could reasonably convict on each count; 
       
      (b) there is no suggestion that the evidential basis for the prosecution would be different in any significant respect at a new trial. 
       
      (c) the administration of justice favours the resolution of the charge at a properly conducted trial; 
       
      (d) it would not be unfair, in a general sense, to put the appellant on his trial again; 
       
      (e) the first trial was completed within three days. 
       
      
    20 The following factors militate against such an order: 
     
      
       
      (a) there has been a significant lapse of time since the offences were committed in 1999/2000; 
       
       
      (b) the appellant has served a significant part of his mandatory custodial sentence, namely approximately one-half of the accumulated non-parole periods; 
       
       
      (c) the appellant was released from custody on the convictions being quashed; 
       
       
      (d) there will be a degree of stress and uncertainty caused by an order for a new trial. 
       
      
    21 The factor weighing most heavily against such an order is the fact of a significant portion of the sentence having being served. However, the effect of a further period of conditional liberty, could, if a further trial resulted in fresh convictions, properly be taken into account by the sentencing judge. Overall the public interest in ensuring that complaints of sexual abuse on a young boy, committed by a member of the family, at least on one occasion acting in a position of trust as a babysitter, should be resolved in accordance with the due process of law should be allowed to prevail. Furthermore, in the present case the appellant resisted the Director’s application for a new trial purely on the basis that the verdict was unreasonable. Accordingly, the order for a new trial should be made. 
     
      
    22 An order for a retrial, perhaps anomalously, does not mean that a further trial will necessarily take place. The decision to put the appellant on trial a second time ultimately rests with the Director of Public Prosecutions: see Spies, above at [6]. 
     
      
    23 HOWIE J: The appellant was convicted after trial by jury of two counts of having sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900. He has appealed against those convictions. The appeal was heard on 13 November last and the Court indicated that the appeal would be allowed and the convictions quashed. However the Court made no other orders and reserved its decision. The issue to be resolved was whether the Court should order a retrial or enter a verdict of acquittal consequent upon quashing the convictions. The appellant was subsequently granted bail. 
     
      
    24 The offences were alleged to have been committed on two separate occasions, about 2 months apart, between 1 September 1999 and 1 March 2000 when the complainant, M.M. was aged 5 or 6 years. The appellant was a juvenile at the time of the alleged offences, being 16 or 17 years. No complaint was made about the alleged sexual abuse until 2006 and the complainant made an interview with police on 19 May 2006. The trial commenced on 29 April 2008 when the complainant was aged 14. The jury returned guilty verdicts on 1 May 2008. The appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment on 8 August 2008 and remained in custody until he was granted bail following the hearing of the appeal. There was no application to appeal against the sentences imposed. 
     
      
    25 There were a number or grounds of appeal filed but only two have to be resolved. The second ground of appeal asserted in effect that the trial judge failed to give the jury a Longman direction as a result of the delay between the date of the commission of the alleged offences and the complaint to police, a period of over 6 years. The fifth ground of appeal is that a miscarriage of justice occurred because “the jury ought to have entertained a reasonable doubt”. It was accepted by both parties that, if the Court upheld the second ground of appeal, the only other ground that needed to be addressed was the fifth ground. 
     
      
    26 The Court indicated at the hearing of the appeal that it would uphold the second ground of appeal and counsel then addressed the Court on the fifth ground. The reasons for upholding the second ground of appeal can be briefly stated and ultimately the Crown all but conceded that the ground should succeed. 
     
      
       
        
        The Crown case 
        
       
      
    27 The Crown case presented at the trial can be summarised very briefly. The complainant was the son of the appellant’s half brother. The jury had played to them a recording of the interview conducted between a police officer and the complainant on 19 May 2006. In the interview the complainant asserted that the first offence occurred while the appellant was babysitting him and his brother while his parents were in Bathurst. The complainant said that he was in kindergarten at the time and his teachers were Mrs Briddle and Miss Moyo. The incident occurred during school holidays. In cross-examination he said that it took place in winter and during a weekday, as his mother went to Bathurst on Thursdays. 
     
      
    28 The complainant stated that the incident occurred in the bathroom of the appellant’s flat in Dart St, Oberon. He was washing his hands when the appellant entered the bathroom, grabbed him on the arms and forced him to the ground. The appellant then pulled down the complainant’s pants and inserted his penis into his anus. The complainant said he was on his stomach and felt something like a “stick going up him”. He could hear the appellant breathing. When he got up from the floor, he saw the appellant’s penis and it looked “red and normal” and big. 
     
      
    29 The complainant said that while the incident was occurring his brother came to the door and asked whether the complainant was all right. The appellant said, “He’s okay. He’s just having a little pain”. Although the brother was called to give evidence at the trial he could not recall any incident occurring. There was evidence that he had learning difficulties and trouble with his memory. 
     
      
    30 The complainant said that after the incident his anus hurt and he felt pain. He could see that his buttocks were red. He did not tell anybody about the incident because he was afraid. The appellant had told him, “Its our little secret”. He also told him not to tell anybody and that, if he told his mother or father, they would not believe him. The complainant said as a result he felt alone and sad. 
     
      
    31 The complainant alleged that the second offence occurred at his home in Bligh Street, Oberon in the same year as the first incident. In cross–examination he said the incidents occurred a month or two apart but he was not certain of this. He was playing in his bedroom and a number of family members and relatives were in the lounge room. The appellant entered the room and said, “Lay on the floor for me again”. The appellant then pulled down the complainant’s pants and inserted his penis into his anus. The complainant said that it hurt and it felt like there was some “really, really sharp thing”. Although he did not see the appellant’s penis, he remembered how it felt on the first occasion. 
     
      
    32 The complainant repeatedly asked the appellant to stop, but he said that “it will be over in a second”. He also said that the pain would not last long. The appellant was moving up and down and the complainant could hear his breathing. When the appellant stopped, he told the complainant to remember it was “our little secret”. The complainant said that he cried and his father asked him what was the matter. He said that he had fallen over. 
     
      
    33 The complainant explained that he had not told his parents because he did not know that what the appellant had done was wrong. He saw a television programme which was about people getting raped and he knew then that what the appellant had done was wrong. He told his parents about a year after seeing the programme. 
     
      
    34 The complainant’s mother gave evidence that the tenancy of the Bligh Street premises commenced in September 1998. The appellant came to live there some time in 1999. Her husband moved into premises in Dart Street in September 1999 because he was a shift worker. The appellant moved into those premises in January or February 2000 but would come to visit at Blight Street. At times the complainant and his brother would sleep over at Dart Street. 
     
      
    35 She said that the complainant told her in 2006 that the appellant had raped him. He told her that it happened when he was sleeping at Dart Street and the appellant had come into help him in the bathroom. He told the complainant to lie on the floor and put his “his thingy” in his bum. 
     
      
    36 A letter from the principal of the school at which the complainant had attended indicated that the complainant commenced kindergarten on 1 February 2000. Ms Biddle gave evidence that she taught the complainant in the first three terms and that Ms Moyo taught him in fourth term. She said that complainant was a well-behaved child and she did not notice any change in his conduct in 2000. 
     
      
       
        
        The defence case 
        
       
      
    37 The appellant gave evidence. He said that in 2000 he was living in the flat in Dart Street. There were times when the complainant and his brother were left there while their parents were away in Bathurst. He denied ever indecently assaulting the complainant. He denied that the boys ever slept over and said they were there for at the most three hours. He denied ever helping the complainant to use the toilet because “it’s not the right thing to do”. 
     
      
       
       
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
        
        Failure to give a Longman warning 
        
       
      
    38 This ground of appeal relies upon a decision of this Court given after the hearing of the trial but before the hearing of the appeal. In TJ v R [2009] NSWCCA 257, this Court was concerned to determine what law operated at the date of the trial of that appellant with respect to the necessity or otherwise of giving a Longman warning. This is a warning to be given to the jury where there has been extensive delay between the date of the alleged offence and the date of the trial. The necessity for a warning and its contents was derived from the decision of the High Court in Longman v The Queen [1989] HCA 60; 168 CLR 79. It is unnecessary for the determination of this ground of appeal to consider in detail that decision or the plethora of cases in this Court concerning the warning. They were reviewed in TJ v R. It was necessary in that case to determine whether the warning given at the trial complied with what the High Court held to be the appropriate warning about the prejudice suffered by an accused where there had been lengthy delay between the alleged offence and the commencement of criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    39 In the present case no Longman warning was given of any kind. This was because the Judge believed, incorrectly as it now appears, that the law was governed by s 294 of the Criminal Procedure Act as it had been amended in January 2007 before the date of the trial. 
     
      
    40 The history of the section is set out in TJ v R and does not need to be repeated in detail here. The section originally was concerned with what the a trial judge should say to the jury where there was evidence that there had been no complaint or a delay in complaint about the conduct that gave rise to the charge before the jury. However, in January 2007 the section was amended by the Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual and Other Offences) Act 2006 to address the circumstances in which a Longman warning should be given and what its contents should be. In effect the section, as amended, required the trial judge to make a determination whether the period of delay was such that the accused had suffered a “significant forensic disadvantage” before warning the jury about the effects of delay. Subsection (5) of s 294 stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The mere passage of time is not in itself to be regarded as establishing a significant forensic disadvantage. 
        
       
      
    41 The Judge raised with defence counsel prior to the summing up the terms of the section as it then appeared and noted that there had to be evidence that the accused had suffered “significant forensic disadvantage” and that there was no “presumed prejudice”. He was of the view that there was no evidence that the accused had suffered a “significant forensic disadvantage”. He, therefore, concluded that, although the delay was significant, “it doesn’t seem to me that it requires a Longman style direction given s 294”. 
     
      
    42 In TJ v R this Court was chiefly concerned with interpreting the transitional provision that applied to the amendments that came into operation on 1 January 2007. The relevant provisions stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        (1) The amendments made by the  
        Criminal Procedure Amendment (Sexual and Other Offences) 
         Act 2006 do not extend to any proceedings commenced before the commencement of the amendments and any such proceedings may continue as if that Act had not been enacted."" 
        
       
      
    43 The Court unanimously held that the amendments did not apply where the accused was charged with the offence prior to 1 January 2007 even if the trial commenced after that date: see per McClelland CJ at CL at [21] to [23]. The other members of the Court agreed with the Chief Judge on this interpretation of the transitional provision. 
     
      
    44 Therefore, applying TJ v R, as the present appellant was charged with the offences prior to 1 January 2007, the amended section did not apply to his trial and a Longman direction was required in accordance with the decided cases. 
     
      
    45 The Judge in the present case, in accordance with his previous ruling, said nothing by way of warning, comment or direction to the jury about the effects of delay upon the ability of the appellant to defend himself. The only warning he gave the jury was what has become known as the Murray warning. This is a standard direction given in addition to a Longman warning and in no way addresses the matters with which the Longman warning is concerned. It focuses the jury’s attention on the importance of the complainant as the sole witness of the allegations in the Crown case whereas the Longman warning draws the jury’s attention to the disadvantages suffered by the accused in meeting the allegations made by the complainant because of the delay before the commencement of proceedings. There was nothing in the summing up that touched upon that issue. 
     
      
    46 The appellant raised a number of matters that were said to be particular forensic difficulties faced by him due to the delay. The solicitor appearing at the trial raised none of these matters in an attempt to persuade the judge that there had been a “significant forensic disadvantage”. Rule 4 may have been relevant had his Honour been correct in determining that the section applied. But in my opinion the trial miscarried because his Honour, by reason of his erroneous view of the applicability of the section, made no attempt to raise the issue of delay to the jury’s attention and point to the difficulties it caused, or may have caused, the appellant in meeting the Crown case. Presumed prejudice by reason of the delay would have warranted the Longman warning. 
     
      
    47 It was for these reasons that I reached the conclusion that the ground was made out and that the convictions would have to be set aside. 
     
      
       
        
        Unreasonable verdict 
        
       
      
    48 The approach that this Court takes to a ground asserting that the verdict of the jury was unreasonable has been settled by a number of decisions in both the High Court and this Court. This Court most recently considered the various authorities in TK v R [2009] NSWCCA 151. The question is whether this Court thinks that upon the whole of the evidence it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty. If this Court experiences a doubt about the guilt of the appellant, after taking into account what advantage the jury had in seeing both the complainant and the appellant give evidence, then that is a doubt that the jury ought to have held. 
     
      
    49 The trial was a short one and the evidence was in a very narrow compass. In deciding whether it was open to the jury to convict the appellant or whether this Court has a doubt about the appellant’s guilt, it is necessary to take into account both that there was no evidence in the Crown case to support the allegations made by the complainant. We also must take into account, even though the jury were not required to do so, the prejudice to the appellant arising from the delay of six years before any complaint was made. 
     
      
    50 In considering the reliability of the complainant the Court was asked to take into account an argument that had given rise to the first ground of appeal filed for the appellant. The ground alleged that the date specified in the indictment should have been of the essence. There was no such submission at the trial but it is argued that the complainant was proved by the evidence to be fundamentally unreliable in his assertion of when the offences took place and therefore the jury should have had a doubt about the appellant’s guilt. 
     
      
    51 The indictment alleged that both of the offences occurred between 1 September 1999 and 1 March 2000. The complainant was never specific about when the offences occurred, which is unsurprising given his age at the time and the delay before complaint. However, he thought they occurred about 2 months apart but was uncertain of this. 
     
      
    52 In his interview with police the complainant said that he thought he was aged 5 or 6 “because he was living in the flats when I was about that age”. He said he was in kindergarten. He believed it was in school holidays because he was not at school. He said it was on a Thursday because that was when his mother went to Bathurst. He said, during cross-examination, that he thought it occurred in winter. 
     
      
    53 The contention is that, when all the evidence is considered together, the incidents occurred in the latter part of 2000, this was because the complaint though it occurred in winter when he was in kindergarten but on holidays. Yet the indictment indicated a period up to March 2000. However, the complainant’s mother thought that the appellant had left Dart St in January or February 2000. The appellant accepted that in 2000 he was living in Dart St and the complainant’s father was staying there as well. He thought he was there for about 3 or 6 months. He also accepted that the complainant and his brother visited those premises when their parents were in Bathurst but denied they slept over. It was common ground that the appellant visited the Bligh St premises after leaving Dart St. It seems plain that, if the incidents occurred, the first of them took place while the appellant was living at Dart St. The evidence seems to be that he left there in early 2000, at the latest in February. 
     
      
    54 It is unnecessary strictly to determine whether the Judge should have told the jury that the time in the indictment was of the essence. But I do not believe that it was. The jury could well find that the incidents occurred in 2000, by reason of the complainant’s association of the incidents with when he was in kindergarten. Yet on all the evidence the appellant had left those premises by March 2000. Clearly the complainant was in error in that he thought they occurred in winter, because by winter of 2000 the appellant was not living in Dart St. Again it was open to the jury to conclude that he was mistaken that the first incident occurred while he was on holidays, that is after he had commenced kindergarten, because he did not start kindergarten until February 2000. He thought it happened while he was on holidays because he was not at school and yet it took place on a Thursday when his mother went to Bathurst. 
     
      
    55 In my opinion there was nothing about the way the trial was conducted that required the jury to find that both the offences occurred within the time specified in the indictment. There was no forensic issue that overcame the general rule that the date specified in the indictment is not an element of the offence: R v RND [1999] NSWCCA 122. It was well open to the jury to conclude that the first incident occurred within the period in the indictment but the second incident occurred after that date. The fact that the complainant was in kindergarten established the year as 2000 but it did not mean that he had actually commenced kindergarten when the first incident occurred. It was open to the jury to find that the complainant was mistaken as to the fact that he was actually in kindergarten at the time and that the evidence was consistent with the incident having taken place shortly before he actually started attending. 
     
      
    56 The second incident seems to have taken place after the appellant had left Dart St and, even though this might have been a date outside the time specified in the indictment, it did not follow that the Crown case failed for that reason alone. 
     
      
    57 Nor do I find that this question about when the incidents occurred destroys the reliability of the complainant to such a degree that the jury should have rejected his evidence. Apart from the issue of whether the complainant and his brother slept over in Dart St, there was no dispute that the circumstances surrounding the two incidents could have occurred. The complainant’s mother supported his account that he and his brother slept over in Dart St contrary to the evidence of the appellant. 
     
      
    58 I take into account the fact that the complainant’s allegations were unsupported by evidence of his family members or the presence of injuries. I also take into account the delay in complaint generally and in particular after he saw the television programme. I accept that the delay caused the appellant forensic prejudice in defending the allegations particularly because of the vagueness of the complainant as to exactly when it was that each incident occurred. Yet unlike the jury I have not had the advantage of hearing the complainant in his interview with investigating police or in his evidence. Of course the jury also saw and heard the appellant give evidence. 
     
      
    59 I am not persuaded from a consideration of the whole of the evidence that the jury should have had a reasonable doubt about the general reliability of the complainant. There was no such inconsistency in his account to police or his evidence or what he told his mother about the allegations that I am left with a doubt about the general truthfulness and accuracy of his account of the incidents. Just from reading the transcript of the evidence I have a sense that the complainant was giving an honest and accurate account of the events and his sensations at the time. 
     
      
    60 I propose that the appeal be allowed, the convictions quashed and that there be a retrial of the counts in the indictment. 
     
      
    61 HISLOP J: I agree with Howie J.

      Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence imposed by Toner DCJ at Goulburn District Court. The applicant was committed for sentence from Moss Vale Local Court after pleading guilty to a charge of robbery in company contrary to s 97 (1) of the Crimes Act 1900. His Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months with a balance term of 2 years. It was agreed that the applicant had been in custody in respect of this matter since 4 March 2008 and that his Honour, as he did, should specify that as the commencement date of sentence. 
     
      
    2 The facts were not the subject of controversy. At about 2.20 am on Saturday 16 February 2008, having departed from a party where considerable amounts of liquor had been consumed, three young men approached the car park of a McDonalds restaurant in Mittagong. The victim was working as a cleaner in the car park. The applicant and one other (a juvenile) accosted him and the latter said that he would get his mates to rob him. These two were carrying beer bottles at the time. As a result of what was said, the victim stood still. 
     
      
    3 The applicant admired a necklace which the victim was wearing and he unclipped the catch and put the item in his pocket. He then asked if the victim had anything else, in response to which a mobile phone was produced and the applicant also took this. 
     
      
    4 Thereafter all three young men ran off. 
     
      
    5 On the same day, police attended premises in Mittagong and found the applicant there on a bench seat. He was seen to be wearing the necklace that had been taken in the early hours of the day but he claimed that he “got it from a mate last night”. The applicant was arrested, handcuffed and placed in a police vehicle. 
     
      
    6 On the journey to the police station the applicant told police honestly how he had acquired the necklace and he also produced the mobile phone from within his trousers. He identified the two persons in whose company he had been at the restaurant car park. 
     
      
    7 At the Bowral Police Station he was formally interviewed and made full admissions about taking the necklace and the mobile phone from the victim. 
     
      
    8 The applicant was aged eighteen at the time of the offence and at the time of sentence. He is now twenty. He had a record of offending for which he had been dealt with at Children’s Courts. At the time of this offence he was subject to a good behaviour bond. A pre-sentence report recorded turbulent family relations during his formative years and transfers between his parents, both of whom had formed new relationships. The transfer to his father’s care involved residing in New Zealand. His schooling was described as “problematic”. He had used multiple illicit drugs from a young age and he also came to drink immense quantities intoxicating liquor. At one point he spent four months at the Ted Noffs Rehabilitation Centre to address this problem but on graduation he partook of “a celebratory drink” and quickly fell back to abusing drugs and alcohol. 
     
      
    9 After leaving school he had some employment tiling and at a warehouse. He has the support of his mother who informed his Honour that she could arrange work on a voluntary basis with the local council when the applicant is released from prison. 
     
      
    10 Consistently with his frankness to police, the applicant pleaded guilty at the earliest opportunity. Subject to the intent of an observation about R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 and guidelines appearing therein, it was nevertheless appropriate for his Honour to consider, inter alia, the utilitarian value of the early plea and what benefit might therefore flow to the applicant in sentence assessment: R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383. 
     
      
    11 Ground 2 in the Notice of Appeal claimed that his Honour failed to allow any, or any sufficient, discount for the utilitarian value of the plea. It is convenient to address this ground. Save initially noting the plea of guilty the only reference in his Honour’s Remarks on Sentence to the plea of guilty was a statement “the offender has entered a plea of guilty at the earliest opportunity, albeit there was probably a pretty strong Crown case against him.” As the strength of the Crown case is irrelevant to any utilitarian value of the plea: R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225 a conclusion follows that his Honour did not make an allowance in his assessment for the utilitarian value of the plea.  
     
      
    12 Ground 3 complained that his Honour failed to have sufficient regard to the value of the guilty plea as demonstrating contrition. As, for reasons which appear herein, I consider this Court should intervene and resentence, it is not necessary to deal separately with this ground. 
     
      
    13 Ground 1 asserted that his Honour “erred in treating the applicant as being ‘on all fours’ with the factors identified in the Henry guideline judgment”. 
     
      
    14 His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This case is broadly on all fours with  
        Henry’s 
         case (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. Each of the criteria identified in  
        Henry 
         at paragraph 162 more or less apply here. There are however additional aggravating features in this man’s case. He is a young offender, true enough but he has quite a substantial criminal history already and for offences like that for which he now stands to be sentenced. There was no weapon used in this case however he did have a beer bottle in his hand and that might have created some additional apprehension in Mr Singh’s mind when he found himself confronted by these three young men alone in a car-park at 2.20am. 
        
       
       
        
        There was a limited degree of planning and I accept entirely that this crime was opportunistic. There was limited violence but the circumstances of the offence itself were pregnant with the possibility of violence against the victim. The victim was in a vulnerable position as I have identified previously. The amount taken, or the value of the goods taken was relatively small, namely the value of the chain and the mobile phone.” 
        
       
      
    15 He added: 
     
      
       
        
        “The aggravating feature above and beyond the factors identified in  
        Henry 
         are that he has a substantial criminal history and he was on conditional liberty at the time; namely he was on a bond from the Children’s Court as I have noted previously.” 
        
       
      
    16 The guideline in Henry specifically applied to an offence of armed robbery, the current offence of robbery in company has the same prescribed penalty and the guideline has been held to apply to such offences: R v Murchie (1999) 108 A Crim R 482. 
     
      
    17 As his Honour did not reveal what gloss he intended by the expression “more or less” it is necessary to look at some of the evidence. 
     
      
    18 As stated, the applicant was a young offender but he did have a criminal history.  
     
      
    19 Each of the applicant and the other offenders were carrying beer bottles at the time. There was no evidence that these had been broken and had sharpened edges so that they might qualify as expressed in the second criterion as a “weapon like a knife”. It was not suggested that the bottles were brandished at the victim nor were they used to threaten him in any way. There was no evidence that this criterion was applicable. 
     
      
    20 The third criterion referred to a limited degree of planning but it is difficult to reconcile his Honour “entirely” accepting that the crime was opportunistic with any degree at all of what might ordinarily be understood as planning. 
     
      
    21 The seventh criterion in Henry is in terms “plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case.” This is consistent with his Honour’s comment already quoted. 
     
      
    22 The notion that the Henry guideline has an incorporated allowance for the plea of guilty has led to some complications particularly in the light of the subsequent decision in Thomson and Houlton. In the latter case the suggested upper limit of discount for a plea at the earliest opportunity was 25 percent. In R v Sundar [2005] NSWCCA 93 it was said to be accepted doctrine that the seventh Henry criterion is taken as representing a discount of 10 percent. That doctrine had earlier been applied in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 with the result that a factor for the utilitarian value of the difference (15 percent) was calculated. This approach has not always been taken although, of course, circumstances differ; see for example R v Teterycz [2005] NSWCCA 197.  
     
      
    23 This appeal is not an appropriate vehicle for pause to analyse whether any inconsistency of approach can be detected. The applicant’s date for parole eligibility is a little over six months hence. For the reasons given, I am of the opinion that this Court should intervene and resentence and in particular he should have a benefit of the utilitarian value of his plea of guilty. Any resentence giving appropriate weight will result in the applicant’s eligibility for release falling due in the very near future. He has already been in custody for nearly two years of the two years six months non-parole period ordered by the sentencing judge.  
     
      
    24 At the hearing his Honour was provided with a letter from the applicant in which he stated that he had remorse for what he had done and that his time in gaol had given him time to think about his actions and to assert that “nothing like that will ever happen again.” 
     
      
    25 For the purpose of resentence the Court received an affidavit from the applicant which reveals that he has maintained that attitude and made good use of his time in custody. An affidavit by his mother reveals that upon release, a home is available for him and some detail is given of the available work which was mentioned at the sentencing proceedings. The applicant’s mother is employed by the local council and her employer has agreed that the applicant may accompany her to work in order to learn about the environment. She has also spoken to a previous employer who has indicated his willingness to consider re-employing the applicant. His mother commented that she had seen a change in her son whilst in custody and she described him as “bright, healthy and accepting of responsibility for his wrongdoings.”  
     
      
    26 In resentencing I would adopt the finding of special circumstances. The sentence which I would substitute represents a head sentence of four years discounted by 25 percent for the earliest available plea of guilty. 
     
      
    27 I would propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) Application for leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      (ii) Appeal allowed. 
       
      (iii) Sentence imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      (iv) In lieu thereof the applicant sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years commencing on 4 March 2008 and expiring on 3 March 2010 with a balance term of 1 year commencing on 4 March 2010. 
       
      (v) The applicant ordered released to parole on 3 March 2010. 
       
      
    28 SIMPSON J: I agree with Grove J. 
     
      
    29 RA HULME J: I agree that leave to appeal should be granted, the appeal allowed and the appellant re-sentenced. 
     
      
    30 I agree with what Grove J has proposed in terms of the non-parole period but find myself unable to agree with the balance of the term of the sentence being twelve months. As I am in the minority in this respect I will state my reasons briefly. 
     
      
    31 As Grove J has observed, the sentencing judge found that: 
     
      
       
        
         “This case is  
        broadly on all fours 
         with Henry’s case (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. Each of the criteria identified in  
        Henry 
         at paragraph 162  
        more or less apply here 
        ”. (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    32 I agree with what Grove J has said above (at [18] – [21]) about some of the specific characteristics identified in relation to the typical case identified in Henry. I also agree that the sentencing judge omitted to make allowance for the applicant’s early plea of guilty. The omission was the failure to observe that the Henry guideline range has built into it an allowance for the utilitarian value of a late plea of guilty. The early plea in this case warranted additional allowance. 
     
      
    33 There is discussion in the cases to which Grove J has referred to there being a need to deduct 15 per cent from the Henry range to achieve appropriate recognition of the utilitarian value of an early plea of guilty. In strict mathematical terms that is not quite correct as the four to five year range in Henry represents sentences that are 90 per cent of a notional starting point. Sentencing, however, is not a matter of mathematical precision (Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at [27]) and guidelines are simply that, they are not tramlines (Legge v Regina [2007] NSWCCA 244 per Spigelman CJ at [58] – [59]). 
     
      
    34 In addition to what the judge said in comparing the typical case characteristics referred to in Henry with the relevant aspects of the case at hand, including that the applicant could not be described as having “no or little criminal history”, he also took into account the aggravating feature that the applicant was on conditional liberty at the time of the offence. A mere four days prior to the commission of the offence he had been placed on a bond by the Children’s Court at Moss Vale for two offences of assault and two offences of resist/hinder police officer in the execution of the officer’s duty.  
     
      
    35 I note also from the criminal history that at the time of the offence the applicant had charges outstanding for an offence of robbery in company, three offences of possession of a prohibited drug committed on separate occasions, and two offences of destroy/damage property. He had been charged with those offences on 30 June 2006, 2 March 2007 and 11 February 2008, the latter being a mere five days before the offence in question. 
     
      
    36 Taking into account these matters of aggravation but giving the applicant full allowance for the utilitarian value of his early plea of guilty and also taking into account the additional material to which Grove J as referred (at [25]), a total term of 3 years 9 months is appropriate.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by King DCJ in Sydney District Court. The applicant had been committed for sentence following pleas of guilty at Downing Centre Local Court on charges of what might shortly be described as fraud by an officer of a company. In the event he appeared for sentence in the District Court on nine counts of such an offence with a further eighteen similar charges being taken into account pursuant to the Form 1 procedure. On eight charges (1 – 7 and 9) his Honour imposed fixed terms of imprisonment for two years commencing on 29 August 2008. These sentences were to be served concurrently with each other. On the remaining count (8) and taking into account the Form 1 offences, his Honour imposed a sentence of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years commencing on 29 August 2009 and expiring on 28 August 2012 with a balance term of 1 year. 
     
      
    2 The practical effect of the sentences created a continuous term of custody for 4 years prior to eligibility for parole for a potential period of 1 year. 
     
      
    3 In his Remarks on Sentence his Honour dealt in detail with the facts of the offences and counsel for the applicant acknowledged in his submissions that there was no challenge to the recitation of them. In that circumstance, and bearing in mind the ambit of challenge in the grounds advanced by the applicant, it will suffice for present purposes to describe the criminal conduct only generally. 
     
      
    4 The applicant was employed by the Nestle Company from about 1993. By 2000 he was appointed to a position described as “Category Manager Confectionary Independents”. His duties and authorities included the provision of gifts, discounts, rebates and prizes to retailers of the company’s products. 
     
      
    5 The applicant participated in a scheme whereby funds which should have been distributed for those purposes were redirected for his own use. The applicant sometimes received the benefit of the funds indirectly by payment for holidays, travel, clothing and other items. It is not presently necessary to digress into an examination of his assertions concerning similar participation by other company employees including those senior to him.  
     
      
    6 His Honour observed that the Crown accepted that offences of the nature charged had been occurring prior to the applicant being engaged but he found that he “not only took over the pre-existing activities but took the offences to a new level by recruiting firms and individuals to be parties to defrauding of Nestle”.  
     
      
    7 The loss to Nestle relating to the nine counts and the eighteen charges on the Form 1 totalled $626,467.92. His Honour found that at least $153,446 was provided directly to the applicant alone whilst the remainder was used in payments for goods and services either by him alone or jointly with others.  
     
      
    8 These findings were not challenged. 
     
      
    9 Civil proceedings by Nestle did not result in any restitution being obtained and his Honour made an order for compensation to be paid by the applicant in the amount of the larger sum abovementioned.  
     
      
    10 The applicant relied upon four grounds of appeal numbered in the notice 1, 2,3 and 5, a ground numbered 4 was abandoned. 
     
      
    11 Ground 1: 
     
      
       
      The learned sentencing judge misstated the period of offending involving the applicant and so over-estimated the total criminality of the offences brought against him. 
       
      
    12 In his Remarks on Sentence his Honour stated that the offences were committed between 4 September 2000 and 28 May 2004. The emphasis has been added. Those dates define the period during which the applicant occupied the position of Category Manager Confectionary Independents.  
     
      
    13 Counsel for the applicant has pointed out that analysis of the specifications in the counts and in the charges on the Form 1 shows that the earliest offence charged occurred on 1 December 2000 and the latest was charged to have taken place on 19 March 2004. Of course, that analysis does not undermine the literal accuracy of the range mentioned by his Honour but it was submitted that “his Honour’s misstatement over-estimated the period of offending by more than five months”. 
     
      
    14 The argument was developed to assert that “by stating a period that must have incorporated offences not brought against the applicant, (his Honour) fell into error by taking into account erroneous material in aggravation of the applicant’s offending”. Reference was made to The Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383. The argument should be rejected. The dates mentioned by his Honour had obvious relevance to the applicant’s holding the position which enabled him to perpetrate the frauds. There was no indication that the applicant was being punished for uncharged offences either during the five months calculated by counsel or any other time. To the contrary his Honour was careful to avoid so doing. Inter alia he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offences occurred at least between the period of 4 September 2000 and 28 May 2004, which is a lengthy period. Although the offender is not to be sentenced for matters other than those which he has been charged with, it is of note that on the agreed facts it appears that the offender has otherwise benefited in the past from funds transferred improperly from the company by others who were later concerned in these matters. But, as I say, Mr Wakefield is only to be sentenced in relation to those matters that are brought against him. Of course the only matters bought (sic) against him are those where he was the person responsible for improperly authorising the actual payment.” 
        
       
       
      
    15 There was therefore no indication of any breach of principle such as those discussed by the High Court in De Simoni. 
     
      
    16 Ground 2 
     
      
       
      The learned sentencing judge failed to assess properly, or at all, the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. 
       
      
    17 The Remarks on Sentence do not contain the expression “prospects of rehabilitation”. That absence does not offer a conclusion that his Honour overlooked that aspect of the applicant’s subjective case. The applicant’s contention was that, in declining to find special circumstances it must be assumed that his Honour rejected the notion that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. I would uphold a Crown submission that such an assumption should not be made. Attention was drawn to a number of matters which would operate to counter a reliable prediction that the applicant had favourable prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    18 These included that, despite a recent substantial income over a significant period no effort had been made to make restitution for the losses and that the motivation of the applicant for revealing information was to diminish his own role rather than to assist in the investigation of his assertions of misconduct by others. His Honour observed that he had difficulty in accepting that the applicant was genuinely contrite and remorseful. The applicant gave evidence in the proceedings and it was open to his Honour to form an impression thereby and he observed that the applicant impressed him in his evidence as “being a salesman attempting to put the best gloss on a defective product”.  
     
      
    19 It is to be noted that his Honour did not find that the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation were poor. An adverse finding to that effect would have made more relevant an examination of the evidence concerning the applicant’s post offence stable relationship and employment and weighing them against matters which had been found to be adverse. Compare Elyard v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 43. His Honour was simply not satisfied that it had been shown that prospects of rehabilitation were good. 
     
      
    20 No error by his Honour has been demonstrated and it is plain that express findings which he made would have inhibited any positive conclusion such as is now sought pursuant to this ground.  
     
      
    21 Ground 3 
     
      
       
      The learned sentencing judge was in error in not finding special circumstances. 
       
      
    22 There are two aspects to this ground. First, whether his Honour erred in not finding special circumstances within the meaning of s 44 of the sentencing legislation, and second, if he did not so err, whether there was error in the ratio which emerged from the cumulated sentences whereby the minimum period of custody before eligibility for parole was 80 percent of the total term. 
     
      
    23 A finding of special circumstances involves a discretionary judgment. In R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 it was said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Simply because there is present in a case a circumstance which is capable of constituting a ‘special circumstance’ does not mean that a sentencing judge is obliged to vary the statutory proportion. To repeat what was said in  
        R v Simpson 
         (2001) 53 NSWLR 704, it is necessary that the circumstances be sufficiently special to justify a variation.” 
        
       
      
    24 The written submissions on behalf of the applicant directed attention first to the departure from the formula in s 44.  
     
      
    25 The learned sentencing judge when imposing sentence on count 8 said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I sentence you to a total term of the sentence of four years. I do not find special circumstances. I impose a non-parole period of three years, which is to commence one year after the commencement of the fixed sentence that I have already imposed in relation to each of the eight other counts. Accordingly, the non-parole period will commence on 29 September 2009, and it will expire on 28 September 2012. The balance of the term of that sentence of four years is one year. That is to commence on 29 September 2012, and to expire on 28 September 2013. I have also taken into account, in the way that I have structured the sentence, the totality of the sentences. Accordingly, Mr Wakefield, you will first be eligible for parole on 28 September 2012, and you will be subject to a further term of one year.”  
        
       
       
      (The stated dates were corrected to substitute August for September, but the need for this has no impact on the point being sought to be made.) 
       
      
     
     
      
    26 No reference was made to the effect of the partial cumulation whereby the balance term then set for count 8 created a minimum custodial term of 80 percent of the total sentence. It is true that, whilst the statute requires reasons to be stated for reducing the non-parole period against the stated formulation, no such requirement has been legislated if it is increased. However it has been stated in this Court more than once that it is expected that in circumstances where there is such an increase some reasons should be provided if only to forestall a conclusion that the specification was the result of error or oversight. In R v Dunn [2007] NSWCCA 312 it was said that this was especially the case where cumulation had taken place. Other examples of intervention by this Court in similar circumstances can be found in R v Lyndon [2003] NSWCCA 152; R v Ibraham [2005] NSWCCA 43. 
     
      
    27 It is clear, as the Crown Prosecutor submitted, that his Honour revealed an express intention that the potential parole period would be twelve months but that expression does not overcome the silence about the proportion of a minimum custody to total term. 
     
      
    28 In my view, it cannot safely be concluded that the matter was not simply overlooked (and neither counsel at the hearing drew his Honour’s attention to it) and this Court should intervene to the extent of applying the statutory formulation. 
     
      
    29 It was further submitted that his Honour should have found special circumstances and further reduced the non-parole period in favour of the applicant on the basis that he had good prospects of rehabilitation and was being required to serve a sentence for the first time. The issue of rehabilitation has been sufficiently dealt with in relation to the previous ground. It is well recognized that first committal into custody may not be sufficient to justify a finding of special circumstances and his Honour was not obliged so to find: R v Kama (2000) 110 A Crim R 47: R v Christoff (2003) 140 A Crim R 45; R v Kaliti [2001] NSWCCA 268. 
     
      
    30 His Honour was not obliged to find special circumstances for the reason advanced nor for any other reason and his discretion in this regard has not been shown to have miscarried.  
     
      
    31 Ground 5 
     
      
       
      The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    32 In support of this ground the applicant presented a series of references to sentences in cases of various frauds. Unsurprisingly, none of these involved conduct exactly matching that of the applicant. Nothing will be gained by reproducing the schedule of cases. It was candidly acknowledged by counsel in written submissions that statistics present a blunt tool and the number of cases was, in any event, insufficient to provide real assistance. 
     
      
    33 To establish that a sentence is manifestly excessive, it is required to demonstrate that it was unreasonable or plainly unjust: The Queen v Dinsdale (2000) 202 CLR 321; R v Vuni [2006] NSWCCA 171. 
     
      
    34 The applicant’s offences continued over a long period of time. The financial loss to the employer has been noted. The offences were committed to sustain what the applicant described to a psychologist as a “pampered lifestyle”.  
     
      
    35 It is not necessary to recapitulate adverse aspects of the applicant’s offending which his Honour noted. The sentence was well within the range of the sound exercise of discretion. 
     
      
    36 Subject to the adjustment of the proportion of the non-parole period to head sentence above indicated, the grounds of appeal fail. 
     
      
    37 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (i) Leave to appeal against sentence granted. 
       
      (ii) Appeal allowed in part. 
       
      (iii) (a) Sentences of fixed terms of imprisonment for 2 years on counts 1-7 and 9 commencing on 29 August 2008 and expiring on 28 August 2010 confirmed. 
       
        
        (b) Sentence on count 8 quashed and in lieu thereof (taking into account the matters on the Form 1) the applicant sentenced to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 2 years 9 months commencing on 29 August 2009 and expiring on 28 May 2012 with a balance term of 1 year 3 months commencing on 29 May 2012 and expiring on 28 August 2013. 
        
       
      (iv) 28 May 2012 is specified as the earliest date of eligibility of the applicant for parole.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against severity of sentence imposed by Woods DCJ at Sydney District Court on 12 March 2009. The applicant had been committed for sentence after pleading guilty in Burwood Local Court to a charge of knowingly taking part in the cultivation of a large commercial quantity of prohibited plants grown by enhanced indoor means for which there is a maximum prescribed penalty of 20 years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 10 years. His Honour was asked to and took into account in sentence assessment a further charge, somewhat imprecisely formulated, in that the applicant “did use, consume, divert etc electricity” unless authorized contrary to the Electricity Supply Act 1995. 
     
      
    2 His Honour sentenced the applicant to imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance term of 2 years. 
     
      
    3 An agreed statement of facts was put before the court for the purpose of sentence. In August 2007 premises at Condell Park were leased to a man using the name of Hung Van Nguyen. This was a false identity. On 27 September 2007 police executed a search warrant at the premises, the front door and windows of which had been fortified with iron bars. No person was in the premises at the time. There was found within a sophisticated hydroponic system being used to grow cannabis under artificial light and fed by complex irrigation lines. 
     
      
    4 A conservative street value of the crop was said to be approximately $500,000. It was found that the electricity supply monitor had been bypassed at the rear of an external switchboard.  
     
      
    5 Investigators identified the applicant’s fingerprints in two rooms of the premises including impressions on two electric transformers, which were located in one of those rooms. A strong profile match was established between the applicant and a toothbrush found in the premises. Other DNA samples related to a female person who was not able to be identified. 
     
      
    6 On 9 May 2008 the applicant was arrested in Bathurst and, as he was entitled, he declined to participate in an interview. 
     
      
    7 The foregoing has been extracted from the agreed facts, however, the applicant gave evidence in the proceedings before his Honour. The learned judge rejected a Crown submission that Hung Van Nguyen was fictitious and that the applicant was the principal in the criminal activity. Having rejected that submission, he continued, drawing from both sources: 
     
      
       
        
        “While I may have my suspicion that that is the case, on the evidence, the probabilities are that this man was approached by somebody or other using the name of Nguyen to undertake some handyman type work on the premises. Generally I accept the version given by the offender. I do so not without some hesitation, but nonetheless on the evidence I am satisfied on the probabilities that he was only there for three days, he realised either immediately or shortly thereafter what the premises were for and he participated in the set up to some extent, the length of which is unidentifiable but I accept three days and he was not one of the gardeners. What he did at the request of the person ‘Nguyen’ was, on his version, to knock down a wall, divert some electrical leads and remove carpeting. Plainly he realised that this was a marijuana cultivation set up. He had already spent time in custody for heroin supply and he is not naïve in the field of illicit drugs. He is not, however, the mastermind of this enterprise, I conclude. He was found at Bathurst in a situation not manifesting any evidence of great wealth and he was still on the disability pension. More significantly in that respect the Probation and Parole reports, exhibits S1 and S2, the report by Dr Law, exhibit S4, and the psychological report, exhibit S3, indicate that this man is a person with reduced mental capacity. He is towards the lower end of functioning intelligence, he has suffered from anxiety to a significant degree and he has had psychological and psychiatric attention for those problems well before these events. On the whole I am prepared to accept his version of events. Nonetheless he has pleaded guilty to a serious crime.” 
        
       
      
    8 At the hearing of the appeal the court drew attention to his Honour’s expression that the applicant did “divert some electrical leads” and to the applicant’s somewhat ambiguous testimony concerning the diversion of the electricity supply to the premises. Counsel confirmed, particularly having regard to the request for the scheduled offence contrary to the Electricity Supply Act being taken into account, that it was not disputed that the applicant diverted the electricity supply. Neither could it be disputed that such activity, apart from reducing or avoiding power usage charges, would be calculated to shield the illegal cultivation from detection. His Honour’s reference to the absence of naivety in relation to drugs was a reference to the applicant’s conviction at Parramatta District Court for supplying more than small but less than indictable quantity of heroin for which he was sentenced to imprisonment for 3 years dating from 23 March 2004 with a non-parole period of 21 months. Although, given the length of sentence, the applicant would have been ordered released to parole at the expiry of the non-parole period, it is not without significance that the present offence occurred only about six months after the expiry of that sentence. The applicant had a further separate conviction for being found on, entering or leaving drug premises contrary to s 36X of the Drug Misuse & Trafficking Act. Details have not been provided but by definition “drug premises” are places used for supply or manufacture of prohibited drugs or the growing of prohibited plants by enhanced indoor means. 
     
      
    9 The applicant relied upon a single ground of appeal which contained two express elements, viz: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. The Sentencing Judge erred in imposing an overall sentence and non-parole period which were each manifestly excessive, having regard to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the objective seriousness of the offence; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the mental health problems suffered by the applicant” 
          
         
        
       
      
    10 It was submitted that his Honour fell into error in failing to assess the objective seriousness of the offence and, referring to the above extract from the Remarks on Sentence, it was submitted that it was not sufficient simply to assess the applicant’s conduct as “a serious offence”.  
     
      
    11 As was observed in the joint judgment in Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357 at 371, neither principle nor grounds of appellate review dictates a particular path that a sentencing judge must follow and that what is required is that all relevant considerations be taken into account in forming a conclusion. The implication of the applicant’s submission was that, given the specification of a standard non-parole period for the offence, his Honour ought to have assessed where in the range of objective seriousness it fell: R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168; SKA v R [2009] NSWCCA 186. Although his Honour did not use that language, setting a non-parole period of less than one-third of the prescription was a demonstration beyond argument that the seriousness was assessed as well below the middle of the range. Matters available to be considered are referred to later in these reasons. 
     
      
    12 The second element of the ground referred to the mental health problems suffered by the applicant. In the passage already quoted from the Remarks on Sentence express reference was made to evidence touching upon these. His Honour returned to them in dealing with a submission that he should vary the ratio between sentence and non-parole period in favour of the applicant. He said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He (counsel) urges upon me that I should find special circumstances for varying the normal relationship between the head sentence and the non-parole period. I am prepared to do that because the mental condition described in the report is significant. He is, I conclude from the helpful report, exhibit S3, a person who has had some kind of a knock to the head when he was a child, which has reduced his brain development. He was not cross-examined about this, but he put to the court that he told the truth to the psychologist and this was not disputed in cross-examination. I accept it. But sometime in his early years, probably about twelve, he had a brain injury following some accident at the age of twelve. His current cognitive testing suggests overall limited cognitive function; this is exhibit S3 para.25. I take that into account and it causes me to structure the sentence as I will, in some part.” 
        
       
      
    13 Again, when referring to the standard non-parole period which, as above noted is ten years, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, it is a measure of the seriousness with which the parliament and the courts view such cases as this, that there would be a standard non-parole period of that kind. The limited role of the offender to which I have made reference and his reduced mental capacity are considerations which make it appropriate for me in calculating the sentence as I have done and bearing in mind the standard non-parole period as a guidepost but no more to set a non-parole period very substantially less than the standard non-parole period.” 
        
       
      
    14 In a written submission counsel for the Crown noted that it was not submitted to the sentencing court that there was evidence sufficient to establish a causal relationship between the applicant’s condition and the commission of the offence. It is true that relevance of a mental condition is not limited to such cases: TC v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 296. But it is plain that his Honour did not restrict his consideration and the applicant in fact received an amelioration of sentence assessment by reason of mental difficulties.  
     
      
    15 It was not disputed and his Honour accepted that the role of the applicant was limited. It was submitted that the applicant’s criminal conduct lay at “the bottom of the range” of seriousness for the particular offence. Obviously it might be assessed as lower than the culpability of the unidentified person or persons who, it can be inferred, intended to nurture, harvest and market the illicit crop. Nevertheless, in common with like activities, every contributor possesses a degree of significance in the overall scheme. His Honour described the applicant’s role as not insignificant. In this instance, the action taken by the applicant, particularly in bypassing the regular electricity monitoring was of marked importance. It is notorious that the power requirements of hydroponic cultivation are so high that usage at such a level is likely to attract attention. The applicant was not naïve and he did not suggest in his evidence that he needed to inquire as to why he was being asked to bypass the electricity monitor. The finding that immediately on arrival or shortly thereafter the applicant realized what the premises were for was not challenged. 
     
      
    16 Viewed in isolation from the legislative prescription of penalty and standard non-parole period, the imposition, reflecting the limited role of the applicant and as ameliorated by the factors take into account, might at first glance impress as severe. However, as the applicant pleaded guilty and the offence was not found to be in the category as high as “mid-range” the standard non-parole period was not directly applicable. Nevertheless his Honour recognized that he was bound to have regard to the prescription as “a guidepost”: Way. In the event, the non-parole period set by his Honour and which the applicant must serve is less than one third of the prescribed standard which reflected an appropriate utilization of the guide. Any further reduction would suggest that the guide had been treated as relatively insignificant.  
     
      
    17 It has not been shown that his Honour erred in using the guide and, taking that and all relevant matters into account, the sentence was not disproportionately high. I am unpersuaded that his Honour’s sentencing discretion has miscarried. 
     
      
    18 I would grant leave to appeal against sentence but dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    19 SIMPSON J: I agree with the orders proposed by Grove J, and with his Honour’s reasons. In agreeing with the outcome, I accord particular emphasis to the applicant’s previous drug convictions. This was the view taken by the sentencing judge, a view I consider to have been correct. 
     
      
    20 RA HULME J: I agree with Grove J.

    2 SIMPSON J: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    3 HIDDEN J: The applicant, Michael Lawrence Waugh, pleaded guilty in the District Court to a charge of armed robbery, and asked the sentencing judge to take into account on a Form 1 an offence of attempting to steal a motor vehicle. For the armed robbery, with the Form 1 matter taken into account, he was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years, comprising a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of 2 years. He seeks leave to appeal against that sentence.  
     
      
    4 The robbery was in breach of a bond associated with a suspended sentence under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That bond was revoked and the applicant was ordered to serve that sentence. However, the commencement date of that sentence was such that it was wholly subsumed within the non-parole period for the armed robbery, and leave to appeal against it is not sought. 
     
      
    5 The facts of the armed robbery can be stated shortly. In the morning of 30 September 2007, the applicant entered the store of a service station at St Marys and presented a knife to the console operator, a woman in her thirties. He demanded money from a cash drawer, saying, “I’m not going to hurt you or anything. I don’t want to hurt you.” She handed him the cash, totalling $102, and he left the service station in a taxi. Notwithstanding his statement to her that he did not wish to hurt her, she feared that she would be stabbed and burst into tears after he had left.  
     
      
    6 The offence on the Form 1 was his attempt to steal a Holden Commodore sedan outside the Nepean Square Shopping Centre some years earlier, on 24 May 2004. He forced open the driver’s door, ripped out the wires to the ignition and attempted to start the car. He was unsuccessful and left the scene. While trying to start the car he cut his hand. After his arrest for the armed robbery, his DNA was found to match that of blood samples taken from the car. 
     
      
    7 The applicant was 32 years old at the time of the armed robbery, and is now 34. He had a troubled background, including a lengthy period when he was a resident of various boys’ homes and was the victim of physical and sexual abuse. He has an extensive history of substance abuse, having used heroin from his early teenage years. Perhaps not surprisingly in those circumstances, he also has a lengthy criminal history.  
     
      
       
      The application 
       
      
    8 The applicant was unrepresented in this Court. He contended that the sentence is excessive, arguing that the sentencing judge fell into error in specific respects. He relied upon written submissions, which he expanded orally. 
     
      
    9 Firstly, he argued that his Honour had given inadequate weight to the fact that he was under the influence of the drug Stilnox at the time of the offence. His Honour accepted evidence that he had been using that drug to help him sleep, and the author of a psychological report explained that it could produce side effects, “including psychotic symptoms and anterograde amnesia”. His Honour had regard to this material in the light of the principles concerning the sentencing of offenders with a mental abnormality or disability summarised in R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228. He found that the applicant suffered from a mental condition which contributed to the commission of the offence in a material way, so that there was not “the same call for denunciation and punishment as would otherwise have been the case …” He also accepted that the condition rendered the applicant an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence, moderating that consideration “to some extent”.  
     
      
    10 His Honour emphasised, however, that the deduction for those factors would be “modest”, referring to R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48. The applicant contended that his Honour’s approach to this issue demonstrates that he had not appreciated the extent to which he was affected by the drug at the relevant time. However, it is clear that his Honour accepted that he was significantly affected. The question was the extent to which that factor should moderate the sentence otherwise appropriate, and it was in that context that his Honour used the word “modest”. In the circumstances of the case, it was open to his Honour to conclude that that “moderation need not be great”, to use the words of Hunt CJ at CL in Wright at 51. There was no error in this approach. 
     
      
    11 Secondly, the applicant complained that his Honour had not taken into account his background and childhood. He referred to his troubled early upbringing, the fact that he was made a ward of the state at the age of 10 or 11, that he was abused physically, mentally and sexually throughout his youth, that it was in those circumstances that he took to the use of heroin, that he had longstanding psychological issues, and that in his youth he did not have the guidance and support he needed. In fact, in his remarks on sentence his Honour referred to all these matters in a comprehensive review of the applicant’s subjective case, and it is clear that he did give it appropriate weight in the sentencing exercise. 
     
      
    12 Thirdly, the applicant challenged his Honour’s finding that there was a degree of planning in the armed robbery. Addressing the applicant in his remarks, his Honour said “… I am satisfied here that there was some degree of planning because you took the knife with you and obviously went to the service station with the intention of using the knife.” The applicant contended that the offence was impulsive and opportunistic, noting that he committed it in broad daylight, undisguised, and used a taxi to leave the scene. 
     
      
    13 However, his Honour referred to the degree of planning in the context of examining the features of the typical armed robbery considered in the guideline judgment in R v Henry [1999] NSWCCA 111, 46 NSWLR 346, per Spigelman CJ at [162]. One of those features is a “limited degree of planning”. Nothing his Honour said suggested that he considered the applicant‘s offence to have been planned in any careful or sophisticated way. He found a level of planning which was no more than limited, and that finding was clearly available. 
     
      
    14 Fourthly, the applicant argued that his Honour had not taken into account the fact that he had reassured the victim of the robbery that she would not be hurt. As he put it in his written submissions, “there was a very low or no intensity of threat shown.” However, as is apparent from my recitation of the facts, that reassurance was of little comfort to the console operator, who feared being stabbed and who burst into tears after the offence was committed. As Giles JA observed in R v Speeding [2001] NSWCCA 105, 121 A Crim R 246 at [24]:  
     
      
       
        
        “When robbery is committed under the threat of a knife, I see no room for alleviating the seriousness of the offence and, as part of that seriousness, the possible traumatic effect on those threatened, by the use of so-called reassuring words.” 
        
       
      
    15 Finally, the applicant complained that his Honour had not given appropriate weight to the effect of his incarceration upon his family, and to the fact that his desire to pursue drug rehabilitation in prison had been frustrated by lack of facilities. He gave evidence in the sentence proceedings about both these matters.  
     
      
    16 At the time of sentence, he had been living with his partner and her son, and the boy was under the care of both of them. His evidence was that, because of his incarceration and his inability to provide for them, his partner and the child had been evicted from their home and were living “house by house” without stable support. However, it seems that no submission about this matter was made to his Honour. This, no doubt, is because the applicant’s legal representative was aware of authority to the effect that hardship to third parties occasioned by the imprisonment of an offender is a matter to be taken into account only in exceptional circumstances.  
     
      
    17 In R v Edwards (1996) 90 A Crim R 510, Gleeson CJ said at 515: 
     
      
       
        
        “There is nothing unusual about a situation in which the sentencing of an offender to a term of imprisonment would impose hardship upon some other person. Indeed, as senior counsel for the respondent acknowledged in argument, it may be taken that sending a person to prison will more often than not cause hardship, sometimes serious hardship, and sometimes extreme hardship, to another person. It requires no imagination to understand why this is so. Sentencing judges and magistrates are routinely obliged, in the course of their duties, to sentence offenders who may be breadwinners of families, carers, paid or unpaid, of the disabled, parents of children, protectors of persons who are weak or vulnerable, employers upon whom workers depend for their livelihood, and many others, in a variety of circumstances bound to result in hardship to third parties if such an offender is sentenced to a term of full-time imprisonment.” 
        
       
       
      Sadly, those observations are apposite to the present case. The hardship to the applicant’s family is not of an exceptional nature such as to warrant a reduction of sentence on that account. I might add that there was no evidence about the family’s access to assistance, including accommodation or financial assistance through government or charitable sources. 
       
      
    18 Whatever might be the truth of the response to the applicant’s attempts to pursue drug rehabilitation in custody, his Honour was dealing with a case in which appropriate weight had to be given to considerations of retribution and deterrence, both specific and general. As the solicitor representing the Crown in this Court put it in written submissions, promotion of the rehabilitation of an offender is but one of the purposes of sentencing. Throughout his lengthy criminal history the applicant had been given the benefit of non-custodial dispositions on a number of occasions and, as I have noted, he was subject to a s 12 bond at the time of the armed robbery. His Honour accepted that he had “some prospects of rehabilitation”, having recognised that he had a major problem with drug abuse, and he sought to foster his rehabilitation through a finding of special circumstances. Nevertheless, a substantial period of full-time custody was inevitable. 
     
      
    19 Given the objective gravity of the armed robbery, the applicant’s age and antecedents, and the fact that he committed the offence while subject to conditional liberty, the sentence his Honour passed is consistent with the Henry guideline and was entirely appropriate. I am not persuaded that his Honour fell into error in any respect in his remarks and, in any event, I am satisfied that no lesser sentence was warranted by the circumstances of the case. 
     
      
    20 I would grant leave to appeal but dismiss the appeal.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: The final ruling I need to make before the trial can commence before a jury, concerns the admissibility of some evidence to the effect that the accused has changed the tattoos he had on his arms after 11 February 2006. The Crown wishes to rely on that evidence as demonstrating a consciousness of guilt, the Crown suggesting that the jury are entitled to find that the accused changed his tattoos because he knew that he was guilty of the crime and because he knew that his lower arms were exposed at the time he committed the crime. 2 Evidence was called today from the tattooist who altered the accused’s tattoos. If accepted that would tend to suggest that the plan to change them had been in place before the offence. Thus if accepted that consciousness of guilt submission falls away completely. However, it is not for me to decide whether Mr Davies was telling the truth or whether Mr Davies was accurate or not. That is, if the evidence is admitted, a matter for the jury. However I will simply say at this stage that it does appear that if Mr Davies comes up to proof there will be no harm (beyond possible prejudice of course) to the accused at all through the admission of the evidence because he will have a complete explanation for the change in tattoos. But of course the probative value of the evidence is obvious. The accused was, according to video footage, in a short sleeved shirt. The accused would not have known what descriptions were given of the tattoos by witnesses and so the jury could conclude that his actions in changing the tattoos after the offence resulted from a consciousness of guilt. 3 Of course simply saying the evidence is probative is not enough to have the evidence admitted, instead I have to compare the probative value of the evidence with the risk of unfair prejudice. The particular prejudice which has caused me some concern relates to the reason advanced by Mr Schneider for him having the tattoos changed. I will have to explain a bit what I mean. One of the tattoos on one of his upper arms was put there as a result of his membership with a motorcycle group called the Lone Wolf motorcycle club. He left that organisation, in somewhat acrimonious circumstance he says, and was seeking to join another motorcycle group, the Hell’s Angels. His evidence was that he could not become a member of the Hell’s Angels while he still had the insignia of another motorcycle club tattooed upon him. He says therefore he went to the tattooist and made arrangements for changes to be made. He also said that he had on his other arm, the word “corruption” in old English lettering which was put there when he and a number of other men, when they were younger, thought it would be a good idea, a decision he later regretted. He finally says that he has also on his arms now the insignia of the Hell’s Angels motor cycle group. 4 Thus it is put by Mr Heliotis that in order to rebut the suggestion made by the Crown, the accused would have to identify himself as a former member of the Lone Wolf motor cycle club and a person who wanted to join the Hell’s Angels. In my view it is not necessary for the accused to go into that detail in order to effectively rebut the evidence advanced by the Crown. Even if he did refer to his former membership of the Lone Wolf motorcycle group it is significant that his membership of that organisation has come to an end. I also have to rely on my own experience here. As far as I am aware, there has not been any publicity let alone significant publicity to the Lone Wolf motorcycle group being involved in any crime such as those attributed to other motorcycle groups such as the Nomads and the Bandidos. 5 I further, do not see that it is necessary for the accused to explain that he wanted to get the Lone Wolf tattoo covered up because he wanted to join the Hell’s Angels. Also in this regard it is important to understand that the alteration which covered up the Lone Wolf insignia caused the tattoo to extend further down one of his arms and in circumstances where it is the lower arms that were exposed the Crown might be able to advance the argument that it is one thing to get the upper arm tattoo changed but to extend it significantly further down the arm is another matter indeed.6 Mr Heliotis also said that there is a risk that the admission of this evidence would enable the Crown to rebut some aspects of what the accused was saying by introducing evidence that the accused had absconded for a significant period of time. It is enough for me to deal with that argument by saying that the Crown has indicated that she would not do so. 7 Mr Heliotis also says that it is prejudicial to his client because he needs to demonstrate that there are other men with tattoos present at the Sapphire Club on the relevant night. Despite many attempts I just was not able ever to understand what it was that made the change in Mr Schneider’s tattoos relevant to an increased prejudice relating to the fact that other men had tattoos. I would have thought that the fact that other men had tattoos was relevant and would be the subject of evidence from the accused if the Crown did not adduce it, whether or not Mr Schneider had changed his tattoos in any way whatsoever.8 The Crown makes the point that what has been altered is the visible parts of the arm with colour being introduced. As I have said there may be innocent explanations for that and the accused may be able to advance it, but that does not mean that the evidence loses all of its probative force.9 Finally Mr Heliotis says that because the tattoos took seven to eight months it may raise the question of what the accused was doing in that time and the jurors may conclude that he had no contact with the police over that time. In my view it is drawing a long bow to say that a jury would conclude merely from the fact that tattoos had significantly changed, that the accused was on the run for a lengthy period of time. That would require the jury to conclude that tattoos took a lengthy period of time to be done, that the tattoos were necessarily done before the accused came to the attention of police, and even that the accused had the particular susceptibility to bleeding that the accused said he did. In my view the danger that a jury might conclude in the way that Mr Heliotis said he or she might, is absent.10 It must be remembered that we are not dealing with this case in the sixties or the seventies and that tattoos are common place these days. It may have in the past said something about the person’s character that they were tattooed but that time has long past.11 I am satisfied that the probative value of the evidence outweighs the risk of prejudicial effect because it is not necessary for the accused to tell the jury everything he has told me in order to effectively rebut what the Crown says against him.12 The evidence that the Crown seeks to adduce will therefore be admitted.

    1 GROVE J: I agree with R A Hulme J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: I agree with R A Hulme J.3 R A HULME: The applicant was sentenced on 9 December 2008 in the District Court at Penrith by his Honour Judge Knight for three offences. There was an offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (methylamphetamine). This is an offence against s 24(2) Drugs Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (“the Act”) for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. A standard non-parole period of 10 years is also prescribed in the table to Division 1A of Part 4 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. 4 The second offence was possession of a precursor intended for use in the manufacture of a prohibited drug, the precursor being hypophosphorous acid and the prohibited drug methylamphetamine. This is an offence against s 24(A)(1) of the Act for which there is prescribed a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. 5 The third offence was one of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (pseudoephedrine). That is an offence against s 25(2) of the Act for which there is a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 10 years.6 In sentencing for the first offence the judge took into account at the applicant’s request three further offences listed on a Form 1 document. They were offences of possessing a prohibited drug (192.5 grams of cannabis), possession of a prescribed restricted substance (53mls of steroids) and possession of ammunition without a licence.7 For the first offence, and taking into account the offences on the Form 1 document, the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years with effect from 19 December 2006. For the second offence the judge imposed a fixed term of imprisonment for 2 years and for the third offence a fixed term of imprisonment for 3 years, both of which sentences were also specified to commence on 19 December 2006. 8 The total effective sentence was one of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years.9 Four grounds of appeal were notified but two were abandoned on the hearing of the application. The remaining grounds are: 
     
      
       
        
        1. The learned sentencing judge erred in allowing his suspicion to affect the ultimate sentence by taking into account matters that were not part of the Agreed Facts. 
         
         
        2. The learned sentencing judge erred by taking into consideration matters adverse to the applicant, which were not open to be made. 
        
       
      
    Facts10 A statement of facts was tendered before the judge without objection and from it I have drawn the following.11 On 19 December 2006 police executed a search warrant at a two acre property in Government Road, Berkshire Park, upon which there was a house, a garage, and three sheds. The applicant lived at this property with various family members.12 51 packets of cold and flu tablets containing pseudoephedrine were found in a kitchen cupboard and in the laundry. A glass jug containing 83.5 grams of methylamphetamine was found in the oven in the kitchen. Also in the oven were two plastic bottles containing liquid in which there was methylamphetamine. In the kitchen pantry was a plastic container which contained 62.7 grams of methylamphetamine.13 Pseudoephedrine in various concentrations were found in the garage in three 70 litre plastic containers of white sludge and powder, on two of three electric woks and on a blender. There were also fifteen empty 20 litre drums and sixteen empty 4 litre bottles which were each labelled as having contained methylated spirits.14 A scanner was found in one of the sheds. Another shed, described as the “green shed”, had a glass sliding door which was open when the police approached. Inside the doorway there was a sheet of black plastic hanging from the roof to the floor obscuring the view into the shed. Within this shed were scientific glassware, exhaust tubing and other equipment set up as a laboratory. The applicant told police that he had rented this shed to a person for about three months for $80 per week. He declined to tell the police this person’s name.15 The statement of facts sets out the method of manufacture that had been carried out on the premises. It involved the use of cold and flu tablets containing pseudoephedrine and the various chemicals and equipment that had been found. The scientific glassware that was found within the green shed was set up in a distillation configuration. The statement of facts also asserts that “multiple processes of this method of manufacture of methylamphetamine had been carried out in the shed”. It also asserts that the pseudoephedrine contained in the three 70 litre drums found in the garage could have been used in this process to manufacture no less than 97.11 grams of methylamphetamine.16 The applicant was arrested and taken to a police station where he was formally interviewed. During the course of that interview he admitted to possession of the drugs and other items which had been seized by the police from within the house. He denied any knowledge of the contents of the green shed. He said that he had put up the black plastic near the door when he set up a hydroponic system there a year previously, but that he cleared the system out of the way when he rented the shed about three months earlier. He said that he was aware that methylated spirits had been placed in the garage and that the woks found there “were dirty and had been chucked aside”. 17 The applicant said that he used 1½ grams of methylamphetamine a day as well as about 1 or 2 grams of cannabis a day. He said that he had not been employed for 11 months. Of the 5 adults and 8 children who lived in the house only 1 adult was employed. None of the occupants paid rent to him. 18 Under the heading “the offenders participation in the manufacture process” the following appears: 
     
      
       
        
        The offender permitted equipment for the manufacture of methylamphetamine to be set up in the green garden shed, and allowed chemicals and equipment used in the manufacture process to be stored in the green garden shed and in the garage shed. He also allowed products of the manufacture process to be stored in both sheds. 
         
         
        The offender also stored cold and flu tablets, precursor chemicals and pseudoephedrine to be used in the manufacture process in his house. Methylamphetamine manufactured in the shed was also stored in the kitchen of his house – 83.5 grams in glass jug in the oven, 62.7 grams in a plastic container in the pantry, and 2 bottles above the oven containing liquid with concentrations of methylamphetamine. 
         
         
        Peter Ballard, forensic chemist, observed the equipment and materials found at the property. Based on the amount of waste product found, he is of the opinion that an amount of methylamphetamine in excess of 1 kilogram could have been manufactured in the green garden shed. 
         
         
        The (applicant) was aware that an amount of about 900g methylamphetamine was being manufactured in the green shed. 
        
       
      
    19 The second offence of possessing a precursor for the manufacture of a prohibited drug relates to the police finding in the laundry of the house a 2 litre plastic bottle containing 1.5 litres of hypophosphorous acid.20 The offence of supplying not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug relates to the police finding on a shelf in a room set up as an office inside the house a plastic shopping bag containing 1,461 grams of pseudoephedrine. 21 The three offences on the Form 1 document related to other items found in various locations throughout the house. There were fifty-three 1 millilitre ampoules of steroids which the applicant said that he had bought for $40 each for his own use, 192.5 grams of cannabis for which the applicant acknowledged ownership, and a total of 217 rounds of various calibres of ammunition.22 In his sentencing remarks the judge noted that the commercial quantity prescribed for methylamphetamine is 250 grams and the large commercial quantity is 1 kilogram. The judge said that he accepted that an amount of about 900 grams of methylamphetamine was being manufactured in the green shed, that is to say a commercial quantity but not a large commercial quantity. The judge specifically noted that if he were to accept that an amount of 1 kilogram or more had been manufactured that would constitute a more serious offence and he would be falling into the error referred to in Queen v De Simoni (1981) 147 CLR 383.23 Further in relation to the manufacturing offence the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        Before going on to look at the other drugs, I should indicate that I am quite satisfied that you knew exactly what was happening in the shed and on your property generally in relation to the manufacture of the methylamphetamine, and that is shown by the multiple places in which the drug and its precursors were found and the very fact that they were found in the house, and in a part of the house which would normally be frequented by people living in it, to wit, the kitchen and laundry. 
        
       
      
    24 In relation to the third offence of supplying a prohibited drug, namely pseudoephedrine, the judge noted that the commercial quantity prescribed for that drug is 1.25 kilograms and the large commercial quantity is 5 kilograms.25 Upon completion of his review of the facts of the matter the judge then stated: 
     
      
       
        
        It does not need words of mine to indicate that these offences are very significant indeed. The community is fed up to the back teeth with people who manufacture and supply and deal in prohibited drugs. There seems to be at large a concept that a person who is a user is in some way, less culpable than a person who is not a user, and that may well be the case, but it is no excuse for engaging in the drug traffic arena that you are doing so to feed a personal habit. 
         
         
        I have a strong suspicion that you were far more involved in the manufacturing process than you have been prepared to concede in your record of interview. But it seems to me  
        I must sentence you on the facts which have been placed before me, and I do so 
        , and, on those facts, your role in the matter was the methylamphetamine to be manufactured in the garden shed on your property, allowing the chemicals and equipment used in that process to be stored in the shed and also in your garage shed, and allowing products of the manufacturing process to be stored in those sheds. As I have already pointed out, you also allowed the precursor chemicals to be stored in your house and you stored the end result, the methylamphetamine, also in your house, and you made available items used in the manufacturing process, such as the oven and woks, on your property, the oven, of course, being part of the house itself. (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    26 The judge then made reference to the judgment of Howie J in R v Gu [2006] NSWCCA 104 at [27] as to the “consistent line of authority … that has made it quite clear that, unless there are truly exceptional circumstances present, a fulltime custodial sentence ought to be imposed wherever the offender has been substantially involved in the supply of prohibited drugs”. He referred to those principles applying also to cases of manufacturing and being knowingly concerned in the manufacture of prohibited drugs. The judge continued: 
     
      
       
        
        The authorities also establish that, in general terms, being knowingly concerned in the manufacture is a somewhat lesser offence than the actual manufacture itself. Having said that, I have little doubt that you were involved, and  
        to the extent that I have already indicated 
        , in this manufacture, and your role in the manufacturing process was significant. I say that because obviously it was your property and it was your facilities which enabled the methylamphetamine to be manufactured on your premises. (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    Subjective features27 The judge noted that the applicant was born in August 1973 and so was aged 33 at the time of the offences and aged 35 at the time of sentence.28 The applicant entered pleas of guilty in the Local Court and for this the judge allowed a discount of twenty-five per cent for their utilitarian value. He also regarded the pleas of guilty as being evidence of contrition and remorse.29 The applicant has a criminal history which the judge described as “very slight”. He noted that the applicant had not spent any time in custody prior to the commission of the subject offences, he was not on any form of conditional liberty, there were no previous drug offences, and the last of the previous offences had occurred some nine years previously. Taking those matters into account the judge concluded that the prior record could be disregarded.30 The judge had before him two reports from the Probation and Parole Service in addition to a report from a clinical psychologist.31 The applicant was born in Lebanon and came to Australia in 1976 at the age of about three years. He was raised in what was described as a strict family environment with a dominating father who rigidly adhered to the traditions of his religion, culture and customs. The applicant left home at the age of about 15 or 16 because of tensions between his father and himself. At some subsequent stage he moved back into the family home because his mother had become ill. His parents separated with his father moving away. The applicant then played something of parental role to his younger siblings and also cared for his mother whose state of health was declining. After about three years his mother died and the judge noted that this had been a source of grief to him and he found it difficult to cope.32 The applicant subsequently married and has three children, the oldest of whom is eight. The marriage lasted about ten years but by the time of sentencing he was separated and regarded himself as being divorced under the law of Islam. The judge noted that the applicant had strong support from his family. He had reconciled with his father, his siblings and other members of his family who had indicated that they would provide him with assistance when he was eventually released from custody.33 The applicant completed the Higher School Certificate in 1991 and had thereafter engaged in regular employment whenever it was available. For most of his adult life, however, he had used illicit drugs to a very significant extent, including heroin, cocaine, amphetamines and cannabis, although there had been periods of abstinence. The applicant gave evidence about the amount of money that he was spending on illicit drugs at the time of commission of the offences but the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        I do not accept that evidence because it varied from time to time. Thus there is conflict between what you originally said, which was five hundred dollars per week, and that was a statement that you made as well to the Probation and Parole Officer, whereas, when you were cross-examined by the Crown it became apparent that you were saying it was five hundred dollars per day, and at one stage you were talking about five thousand dollars per week. Your evidence was all over the place and I am not satisfied that it should be relied on, besides which I do not regard it as being necessary for the purposes of sentencing. I accept that you were using a cocktail of various drugs at the time you committed these offences and had been doing so for years, and I accept that part of your payment in relation to allowing these drugs to be manufactured on your property was the supply of illicit drugs. I accept the statement at the top of page 3 of the Probation and Parole Service report on 16 July 2008 as follows: 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “He attributed his use of illicit substances and the lure of financial gain as causal to his offending.” 
          
         
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        I accept that as an accurate statement. It does not seem to me that the precise amounts of money involved are important in the determination of the appropriate sentence for you. 
        
       
      
    34 The judge then stated that the applicant had behaved himself “at a very high level” since going into custody. He had undertaken various drug and alcohol programs and some educational programs in literacy and computing. It was also noted that the applicant was currently engaged in study as an external student at the University of Southern Queensland, studying in the field of child psychology and that he hoped to complete that course which would take approximately four years. He continued: 
     
      
       
        
        It seems to me, on the material that has been put before me, that you are making considerable efforts to overcome what you now recognise as a real problem in your life, namely your use of illicit drugs, and the sentences that I intend to impose on you are designed to try and assist you in your rehabilitation. 
        
       
      
    Other aspects of the judge’s approach to sentencing35 The judge found that there were three statutory aggravating features but given the abandonment of the ground that the sentences are manifestly excessive it is unnecessary to dwell upon them.36 As to mitigating factors in s 21A(3) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, the judge was satisfied that the applicant did not have a significant record and that he was a person of good character, notwithstanding the previous convictions, and that he was remorseful. He found that the applicant had “high prospects, and good prospects, of being able to avoid re-offending” but stopped short of finding that he was unlikely to re-offend. He did find, however, that there were good prospects of rehabilitation. In this regard, he noted that the applicant had not previously had any professional assistance in attempting to overcome his drug addiction prior to going into custody and that he had availed himself of the services that were available in custody for that purpose. The judge said that this spoke volumes for the applicant’s intention and he was satisfied that the psychologist was correct with the emphasis that he had placed on rehabilitation. He noted, in particular, a passage in the report which stated, “rehabilitation will necessarily be long and extensive”. The judge indicated that he agreed with that statement and that it would have a significant impact in terms of the parole period that he would impose. Finally, the judge again noted the applicant’s plea of guilty. 37 The judge indicated that, in accordance with Pearce v R (1998) 194 CLR 610, he had determined the appropriate sentence for each offence and then considered the question of whether to accumulate or partially accumulate the sentences having regard to the principle of totality. He stated that his conclusion was that the “second and third offences were completely bound up with the first offence” and so he proposed to make all of the sentences concurrent.38 After announcing the sentences the judge indicated that he found special circumstances for the non-parole period for the first offence being less than three quarters of the total term in that this would be the applicant’s first time in custody in conjunction with his need for a lengthy period of supervised parole in order to assist his rehabilitation.Grounds 1 and 239 These grounds were argued together in written submissions and were not supplemented by oral submissions. Briefly they assert, first, an error in the judge allowing his suspicion to affect the ultimate sentence by taking into account matters that were not part of the agreed facts and, secondly, an error in taking into consideration matters adverse to the applicant which were not open to be taken into account.40 Attention was invited to the following exchanges which occurred in the course of submissions on behalf of the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: … It’s quite clear that special circumstances need to be found. 
         
         
        DAILLY: Thank you, your Honour. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: So I would be envisaging dividing any period of time in custody half and half between non-parole period and total term. 
         
         
        DAILLY: Thank you, your Honour. I’ll jump forward in my submissions and see what else I’m able to put to your Honour in that regard. 
        
       
      
    41 A little later in the course of an exchange with the representative of the Crown concerning the applicant’s role in the manufacture offence there was this: 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: I mean quite frankly Mr Crown I have extreme reservations about accepting his evidence that his involvement in it was as little as –  
        but I can’t allow suspicion to rule the case. I’m bound by the agreed statement of facts and I intend to apply them 
         but if it were left to me I frankly don’t believe in what he says that his only part in it was the renting out of the shed.  
        I think he was in it up to his ears but I won’t sentence on that basis 
        . (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    42 Then, immediately after indicating that he proposed taking the luncheon adjournment: 
     
      
       
        
        DAILLY: Before your Honour takes it, Mr Yaghi just pointed out to me, which I remind, well not remind, your Honour hasn’t heard the evidence, there was no evidence in the brief in relation to Mr Yaghi, surveillance evidence, if we put anything of that nature being in the shed, there is no fingerprint, no DNA evidence. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Yes, look I want to make it perfectly plain, whilst I have reservations about accepting his role in the matter was as little as what the facts that have been put before me would indicate,  
        I am bound to sentence on the facts that have been agreed between the parties and I intend to do so 
        . I have a very strong suspicion but  
        suspicion is not a basis of sentencing, so I want to make it perfectly plain to you and your client that even though I strongly suspect that he has a far greater role in this than he is prepared to admit, the fact is that I am going to sentence on the basis of what’s been put before me 
        . (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    43 Upon resumption after the luncheon adjournment there was this exchange with counsel for the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: Yes all right. There is a couple of things I have been thinking about this over lunch gentlemen, there is a couple of things I want to raise with you. First of all Mr Dailly I think I may have indicated to you that I was contemplating dividing any term in half for a short – for a special circumstances (sic). 
         
         
        DAILLY: Yes. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: I am not sure that that would be appropriate in the circumstances, I clearly think it is a case where special circumstances ought to be found but as I would not want to mislead you, I am not presently contemplating dividing precisely in half. So I may have cut you off earlier and if that is the case then now is your opportunity to speak. 
         
         
        DAILLY: I had obviously as I said the force of my submission rests in rehabilitation and it was based on that submission and principally that submission I was going to ask your Honour to split the sentence in half on that basis in furtherance of what Mr Borenstein said and I do not think I can make the submission anymore detailed than that to your Honour that I was going to ask your Honour to consider that, when your Honour made a note of that earlier that might have been what your Honour was going to do, I did not say anything at that point for that reason. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: No that is why and that is why I am raising it with you because I do not like to mislead counsel. I mean I was not attempting to but that was my thoughts at the time but I have been thinking about since. 
         
         
        DAILLY: Yes. No your Honour I would ask that your Honour still consider the split in that term … . 
        
       
      
    44 Counsel continued making a submission in support of his proposition that there should be an even division of the sentence as between non-parole and parole periods. Subsequent to that, the representative of the Crown conceded that special circumstances could be found but submitted that a “50/50 split would perhaps make any sentence perhaps more lenient than it would otherwise might be”. The judge then immediately delivered his sentencing judgment.45 It was submitted on behalf of the applicant that the judge had changed his mind from his earlier indication of setting a non-parole period at 50 per cent of the overall sentence after indicating his suspicion about the role played by the applicant in the manufacture offence. The submission was made that “despite his Honour’s clarification that he would not sentence based on ‘suspicion’ it would appear to have affected his decision concerning the calculation of the overall sentence and most notably the non-parole and parole periods”.46 It was further submitted that the comments by the judge concerning his suspicion about the applicant’s role gave rise to the appearance of bias. After referring to R v Kearns [2003] NSWCCA 367 at [35], which in reality is a reference to Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488 at 492, it was submitted that “a fair minded lay observer would reasonably apprehend that suspicion did in fact affect his Honour’s thought process and the ultimate sentence imposed. Particularly with reference to the parole and the non-parole period imposed”. 47 The written submissions assert that “counsel raised objection to his Honour’s comments on the basis that there was no evidence to suggest the presence of the Appellant (sic) ever having been inside the laboratory”. This is a reference to the submission of counsel immediately before the luncheon adjournment set out above. I would not characterise it as the “raising of an objection”. It is not at all evident that counsel perceived any appearance of bias and, in my view, there was no ground for any such a perception.48 On the material that was before him it was open to the sentencing judge to hold the suspicions that he outlined. The critical thing, however, is that the judge said, in the emphasised portions of the passages quoted above, both in his exchange with counsel and in his remarks on sentence, that he would not allow suspicion to affect the exercise of his sentencing discretion. Counsel for the applicant did not invite attention to anything said in the remarks on sentence that would indicate, either explicitly or implicitly, that the judge’s discretion had been influenced in even the slightest fashion by what he had said earlier in the course of submissions. The applicant bears the onus of persuading this Court that the judge should not be taken at his word. In my view he has not discharged that onus. 49 I am unpersuaded that there is any connection between the raising by the judge of his suspicions about the applicant’s role and his decision concerning the extent to which the non-parole period might be reduced. All that happened was that the judge at an earlier stage indicated a relatively generous but tentative view on that topic. Then, after reconsidering the matter during the luncheon adjournment and as a matter of procedural fairness he informed counsel for the applicant that he had modified his view.50 The written submissions on behalf of the applicant include reference to FV v R [2006] NSWCCA 237 and R v Uzabeaga [2000] NSWCCA 381; 119 A Crim R 452 which are concerned with the need for a sentencing judge to accord procedural fairness when the judge is contemplating sentencing upon a different factual basis than is set out in a statement of agreed facts. The cases are authority for the proposition that a sentencing judge will err if he or she fails to give notice that he or she is minded to sentence upon a basis which differs from that contained in a statement of agreed facts and fails to provide an opportunity for the parties to address on that issue. These cases do not support the applicant’s contention.51 There are other authorities concerning the same or analogous situations that are on point. They include R v House [2005] NSWCCA 88 per Wood CJ at CL at [23]; Fairbairn v Regina [2006] NSWCCA 337; 165 A Crim R 434 per Basten JA at [2] and Bell J at [37]; and Regina v JRB [2006] NSWCCA 371 per James J at [42]. 52 Most pertinently, in R v Howard [2004] NSWCCA 348 Spigelman CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        [47] … a trial judge is entitled to put propositions during the course of argument and to modify those propositions, either as a result of submissions or in the light of further consideration of the relevant material. 
        
       
      
    53 This is precisely what his Honour Judge Knight did in the present case. He indicated a view on a particular topic but, after he had considered the matter further and was contemplating taking a different approach, he informed counsel for the applicant so as to permit an opportunity for him to make further submissions on the topic.54 I am of the view that there is no merit in either grounds one or two. I propose that leave to appeal be granted but that the appeal be dismissed.

   1. HIS HONOUR: Beau Leglise, who was born on xx xxxx 1989, is before this Court on three charges. The first is aggravated robbery committed on 14 April 2009. That is proffered under s 95(1) of the Crimes Act1900 (NSW) and carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment. The second is robbery in company on 15 April 2009, the victim being Daniel Jones. The third is a robbery in company on the same day, the victim being Diego Valverdi.2. The second and third counts involved a robbery in company of two people who were together at the same time. The first count involved a robbery on a man called Kim at a totally separated time and in a different place.3. At the time these robberies were committed he was on bail for offences with which he had been charged on 21 December 2008, that is, of assaulting an officer, resisting arrest and behaving in an offensive manner and another offence for which he had been charged on 11 December 2008, one of possessing implements with an intention to use them for the purpose of breaking and entering a motor vehicle.4. Those particular matters, the 2008 matters, were eventually brought to court on 2 December 2009. He was given a sentence of three months imprisonment for assaulting an officer in the execution of his duty, a concurrent three months imprisonment for resisting an officer in the execution of his duty and four months for possessing implements with an intention to enter a motor vehicle. Those sentenced commenced on 2 December 2009. The three months sentences will cease on 1 March 2010 and the four months sentence will cease on 1 April 2010.5. At the time he committed these offences he was on a form of bail that permitted him to be at liberty so that he could take part in a conference program being organised in the local court, obviously with a view to keeping him out of gaol. However, he on 14 and 15 April committed offences that resulted in his being in gaol. He was arrested on 15 April, he was refused bail, and he is still there.6. The details of the offences are contained in a statement of facts. It is not necessary that I read out everything in the statement of facts. It suffices to say that the first offence at 9pm on 14 April was an attack on a Mr Kim who, with two of his friends, was walking home through Prince Alfred Park, towards Central Railway station, after he had attended an evening class. He was confronted by five or six people in a group and the offender was one of them. The facts produced by the Crown are to the effect that the offender, personally, grabbed a bag being held by Mr Kim over his shoulder and pulled it in an attempt to get it and that caused Mr Kim’s right shoulder to become dislocated. At that point the offender then took the mobile phone, rummaged through the bag that he had been attempting to get, looked at it, but left without doing anything more than take the mobile phone. The other men with the offender prevented Mr Kim’s friends from assisting him. 7. Mr Kim was taken to St Vincent’s Hospital and was treated for a dislocation of his right shoulder joint. So, in the course of this robbery he suffered actual bodily harm.8. About three hours later the offender, with the same group of people, probably, certainly a group of people, approached two men, Diego Valverdi and Daniel Jones, who were sitting in Bourke Street, Darlinghurst, near Taylor’s Square. He demanded that they hand over their money and he threatened to bash Mr Jones and his wife. The others were with him at the time these threats were made. One of them was holding a beer bottle and was swinging the beer bottle in a hand. The offender made offensive remarks to Mr Jones, alleging, amongst other things that he was a homosexual, and again demanding money. Eventually Mr Jones succumbed to the threats and gave him ten dollars and his mobile phone. One of the people in the group was a woman, she approached Mr Valverdi and demanded his phone and threatened to smack him in the head if he did not give it to her. The other people in the group took Mr Valverdi’s sunglasses. And the offender, just to complete the assault and show his contempt for the people he was assaulting, spat in Mr Valverdi’s left ear. Before the group left they handed Mr Valverdi back his phone, apparently believing it had a tracking device in it. Mr Valverdi and Mr Jones left the area. They people continued to pursue them and harass them until other persons intervened. The two victims then went to the Surry Hills police station and reported the robbery.9. Ultimately the offender was arrested and admitted that he was involved in both the robberies. I think it is fair to say, as his solicitor put to me, but for that admission it is unlikely he could have been charged with the robbery of Mr Valverdi and Mr Jones as they could not identify him.10. He has an unfortunate background, as is often the case with people who come to the court for offences such as this. He commenced attending courts when he was about fourteen years old and became involved in a number of offences for stealing motor vehicles, entering enclosed lands and similar offences. He was dealt with gently in the juvenile courts and spent really very little time locked up in juvenile institutions. It would appear that at an early age he was sexually assaulted by a family friend but could not bring himself to do anything much about it. He has also been sexually assaulted by other men and has found great difficulty in being able to talk to anyone about it; that is very understandable, it is a very difficult thing for anyone who has been sexually assaulted, particularly if he is a male, to be able to admit to other people that he has had that assault carried out on him.11. He has been assessed by a psychologist as having a fairly low IQ and has given evidence before me and having heard him give evidence I would agree with the assessment of the psychologist in that regard. The psychologist has also assessed him as suffering from post traumatic stress disorder and I would think that is a perfectly correct diagnosis. On the night concerned it would appear he had been drinking to excess from a flagon of wine and in fact he has very little memory of what went on. He accepts that he did what the Crown has said he did, but he cannot distinctly remember doing any of these things. He has expressed upset that he has hurt the victims in this way, and his expressions of regret and contrition appear to me to be perfectly genuine. He has had periods in his life when he has not been in trouble and those periods have been when he has had relationships with young women who have helped him to stay out of trouble. He has had employment on occasions. In gaol he has been working and in particular in Bathurst gaol he has been working in an area where small electrical goods are repaired. He is clearly frightened of gaol and related in evidence some threats that had been made to him. He I think has every reason to fear those threats.12. It is difficult to know precisely what to do with him. The first offence is more serious than the classic Henry guideline robbery because someone was actually injured. I think it likely he did not, when he was grabbing the bag, consider that possibility. There is no evidence that he set out to cause injury to someone or that he was gratuitously injuring someone in the course of a robbery. All offences are aggravated by the fact that he was on bail at the time and indeed the Local Court was attempting to get him to accept that he had problems and he could do something about it, and to keep him out of the criminal justice system. It is the first time he has been in custody in a prison. He has done a health survival course, he has done an occupational health and safety course. He has applied to do a drug and alcohol course, but there are currently no vacancies in that course. He is entitled to twenty five per cent discount on sentence because he pleaded guilty at the first opportunity, and indeed he made known to the police information that resulted in him being charged with the second and third offences.13. I am required to impose separate sentences for each offence. It is clear that for offences such as this only in very exceptional circumstances can there be a sentence otherwise than of imprisonment. There are no very exceptional circumstances here, or even exceptional circumstances here. All that can be said is there are some very sad circumstances from his background. Clearly he has been a disadvantaged young man. He can read and write, a little, but not very well, his education is very limited and he has unresolved problems arising from sexual assaults that have been perpetrated upon him. 14. That being said, there can be no excuse for anybody robbing people who are quite lawfully walking across a park. The park in question, Prince Alfred Park, is very much used as a thoroughfare for people attending courses in the Redfern area who wish to go back to Central Railway station or to Surry Hills. 15. Taylor Square, Darlinghurst, the offence of the second and third robberies, is a place where many people gather. There are seats for them to sit in, there’s a fountain, great care has been taken by the council to make the area an attractive one, there are lights, there are cafes, there are places of entertainment nearby, and anybody should be able to feel perfectly safe and free of threat and able to sit there at any hour of the day or night. 16. I have no doubt that the fact that he was drinking heavily had a lot to do with these offences. That being said, that does not excuse what was done. Because he is young and it is the first time he has been in a gaol I think there is some reason for some leniency. Normally, it would not be appropriate to make all sentences concurrent. As the prosecution has quite correctly put to me, the offences committed on 15 April, though some hours later, were separate offences and in normal circumstances would require a separate cumulative, or partially cumulative sentence. 17. In this case, because of his youth, because of his very sad background circumstances, because of the attempts he has made to rehabilitate himself, I have decided I am going to give him an exceptionally generous sentence which will be the same for each offence and each sentence will be concurrent. I have done that deliberately, not accidentally, and I have done it recognising that in normal circumstances it would not be correct to do it. But I have done it because in this case I think he should be given some chance at rehabilitation - that should outweigh everything else at this stage. And that chance of rehabilitation, if it is accepted by him, will see him not come back to gaol in the future. If I am wrong, he will be back and regretfully things will get worse and worse for him.18. In each matter I sentence him to a non-parole period in each case that will commence on 15 April 2009 and will cease on 14 October 2010. The balance will go from 15 October 2010 to 14 April 2013. There will thus be a four year head sentence and effectively a one year six month non-parole period, which is an exceptionally generous non-parole period.19. I recommend that when he is on parole, the parole authorities should consider finding a rehabilitation facility to place him in for the purpose of dealing with his alcohol problem, which is a marked one. I recommend that when he is in custody he be given access to drug and alcohol programs and anger management programs and literacy programs and education programs. I recommend that the gaol authorities, if they possibly can, return him to Bathurst gaol and permit him to continue to work in the small electrical repair shop.20. The larger than usual non-parole period should enable an intensive effort to be made to keep him out of trouble, I have to tell you Mr Leglise, when you are released on 14 October 2010, and I direct that you be released on that date. If you go back to what you were doing before and get yourself into any sort of trouble, at all, the parole authority will revoke your parole. And that in all likelihood means you will be required to serve the balance of the term, which is a four year term, in a gaol. That is not absolutely fixed, they have their own discretions, I do not have anything to do with it. The parole officers will help you, if you wish to be helped. They will give you the benefit of programs and assistance, if you wish to be assisted. If you do not, and you want to go back to drinking and robbing, you will be back in gaol again. And, indeed, not only will they revoke the parole and put you back for that, but for what other offence you have committed you will get another sentence and it just gets worse and worse. Now, I have had people before me that have spent most of their adult life in gaol. They have spent twenty-five, thirty years, in and out of gaol. They go in for a couple of years, they come out for a couple of months, they go in for three years, they come out, they go in again, they come out again - and when they are fifty-five they have served already a life sentence in short sentences, all the way till they are fifty-five years. Now, that can be your fate if you just keep offending. It is really up to you to decide. If you do the right thing, you will be released on 14 October this year. The parole authority, although I have said you should be released on that date I directed you be released, they can prevent that if they considered you were for some reason not suitable. Now, I do not think they would do that. You apparently are doing the right thing in the gaol. But you have to continue doing the right thing.21. I have made recommendations for courses I think will be made available to you as people become able to give them to you, you should take advantage of them when they are offered. I also recommend that you be classified as soon as possible. They may then, when they classify you, put you in a lower security classification. That again depends on your conduct. If they do that there are minimum security sections at Bathurst Gaol.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Much of the last few days has been taken up with the question of whether the Crown should be entitled to rely on evidence of flight before the jury. 2 It seems that soon after the events of 11 February 2006 the appellant learnt from rumours at his workplace and from his friends that he was a suspect in the shooting. He approached a number of lawyers and arrangements were made for him to hand himself in. But instead of that occurring he fled, making efforts to cover his tracks. The authorities heard nothing from him until some eighteen months later when the accused, who was then living in South Australia, contacted a South Australian lawyer. Arrangements were made for him to surrender himself to South Australian police. He was granted bail and he voluntarily came back to New South Wales where he turned himself in to New South Wales police. 3 A great deal of the evidence that I have heard concerns the events of early March. The accused relies on those events as demonstrating that he had a reason for absconding that was unrelated to a consciousness of guilt. I do not need to set out that evidence in any detail at all. I will however say that I do not accept that that was the reason for his initial flight. It is not the law that an accused person can cause Crown evidence to be rejected simply by claiming a need to introduce prejudicial evidence to rebut it. And so if I was looking only at the question of initial flight I would say that I do not accept the appellant’s evidence on that and would have allowed the Crown to call the evidence it wished. However the situation is entirely different regarding an explanation that the accused offered for his continued absence.4 He gave evidence that whilst he was on the run he became aware of newspaper articles. The Crown tendered a copy of one of the newspaper articles. It contains a number of inaccurate and inflammatory statements, I am not able to reject the accused’s evidence that having seen or at least learnt of these articles he formed the opinion that he may not get a fair trial. The article is headed “Police hunt for bikie angel of violence” and a photograph of Mr Schneider appears. The first paragraph is, 
     
      
       
       “This is the man police believe drew first blood in a dangerous ongoing turf war between Sydney’s outlaw motorcycle gangs”.  
      
    This is not correct. The shooting had nothing to do with any “turf war”. Of course I can tell the jury that it is not correct but no doubt the fact that Mr Schneider who was there at the scene when the shooting occurred and knew that it had nothing to do with an ongoing turf war between Sydney’s outlaw motorcycle gangs would have led Mr Schneider to have concerns about the fairness of any trial that he would face, both in terms of the inaccuracy of the statement and its likely effect on any potential juror.5 The article refers to a “spray of bullets”. Again that is not accurate but has the potential in Mr Schneider’s mind to inflame a potential juror and cause concern that inaccurate information was published. The article says, “Gang squad detectives are tight lipped about Schneider”. Well that is not true either. It seems that they were responsible for the publication of the article in the first place in a matter referred to by Detective Sergeant Kerfoot in his evidence before me. I wish to make it clear I am not being critical of the police at all. They had a man who they believed to be an armed and dangerous offender on the run and needed the assistance of the media in order to identify where he was. So I repeat, I am not being critical of the officers. What I am looking at however is the affect of the publication of that article on the decision of Mr Schneider to remain in hiding.6 Having looked at the article, having heard Mr Schneider’s evidence, I cannot say that I am satisfied that the newspaper article had nothing to do with his decision to remain in hiding. That means I have to look at the question of whether it would be fair to Mr Schneider to introduce evidence of flight and remaining in hiding in circumstances where I consider that he should be entitled to put before the jury an explanation which reveals a number of aspects of his character including that he was a member of the Hell’s Angels outlaw motorcycle gang. In particular I have to compare the probative value of the evidence of flight with the risk of unfair prejudice that the explanation would create. 7 This is an unusual flight case because of the circumstance that the offender ultimately turned himself in. Nor is it a case where he waited until the evidence against him was significantly weaker, such as might be the case if a star Crown witness had died. So in terms of consciousness of guilt this is not as strong a case as if the accused had ultimately been detected by police and arrested without his cooperation. 8 The probative value of flight is always problematic because it can usually, in fact almost always, be explained by a fear of unjust conviction. A person can say “look I ran away because I was worried that I, an innocent man, would find myself unjustly convicted. “9 On top of that is the circumstance that I referred to in this case; that it was the offender who turned himself in. The probative value of the evidence has to be looked at in that light.10 Then we come to the question of the risk of unfair prejudice and there are two particular aspects that I wish to refer to. The first is the accused, in order to present his response to the Crown’s suggestion that he fled because he knew he was guilty, would have to refer to some aspects of the newspaper articles, those being the aspects that caused him concern. The newspaper articles, even such reference to them would raise in a potential juror’s mind significant questions as to the accused’s bad character.11 The other is the possibility, which I must do what I can to guard against, that despite any direction from me, even a forceful one, a juror might act in contrary to his or her oath or affirmation and conduct their own research. If one types in the words “Wayne Schneider” into Google the results are such that significant features of the publicity that has attended Mr Schneider are revealed.12 So the risk of unfair prejudice encompasses not only the fact that in order to present his case as forcefully as it should be presented, he would have to refer to the content of the newspaper articles. It also includes the risk that a juror would himself or herself, having learned about the existence of the newspaper articles, go looking for them. The publicity which has attended Mr Schneider’s flight and arrest, and I see from Google other matters as well, is going to require careful management by me and counsel as well in order to prevent jurors being prejudiced against the accused. The risk however of prejudice is exacerbated to the extent that the risk of unfair prejudice outweighs the probative value of the flight, if I were to admit evidence of flight.13 I note in passing that Madam Crown made the submission that evidence of the accused’s membership of the Hell’s Angels would need to be admitted in any case. However I rather gather that she pressed that position somewhat faintly. In my view the accused’s membership has, as I understand the case, no relevance at all and certainly if it has relevance in a way I have not yet understood, I cannot see how the probative value of that evidence would outweigh the risk of unfair prejudice; that risk of unfair prejudice being rather obvious.14 The result is that I will not allow the Crown to adduce evidence of flight, nor will I allow the Crown to adduce evidence at this stage that the accused was a member of the Hell’s Angels. It may be that I need to revisit that latter ruling later on, but as matters stand that is the decision I have come to.

     Judgment 
      
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: Like Hidden J, I agree with Howie J that the overall sentence imposed upon the applicant was excessive and I also agree with the orders which his Honour proposes. 
     
      
    2 I also agree with his Honour’s view as to the inadequacy of the range of sentences currently being imposed on those who commit a large number of armed robberies. However, it must be noted that in the present case the applicant was being sentenced only with respect to two offences of armed robbery and one offence of assault with intent to rob. Accordingly, I would not regard him as being one of those persons to whom Howie J’s remarks were directed. 
     
      
    3 Nevertheless, although he was being sentenced with respect to multiple robbery offences, their number could not be described as large: cf Qing An. This fact provides further support for his Honour’s conclusion that in the circumstances the overall sentence imposed on the applicant by the sentencing judge was excessive. 
     
      
    4 HIDDEN J: I agree with Howie J that the overall sentence passed upon the applicant is excessive, and I agree with the orders which his Honour proposes. I prefer to express no view about the adequacy of the current range of sentence for multiple armed robberies.  
     
      
    5 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court by Judge Nield (the Judge). The sentences were passed upon the applicant after a jury convicted him of three robbery offences. The three counts on the indictment were as follows: an armed robbery committed on 29 July 2006 (count 1); an armed robbery committed on 6 August 2006 (count 2); an assault with intent to rob while in company on 12 August 2006 (count 3). The maximum penalty prescribed for each of the offences was 20 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    6 The Judge sentenced the applicant as follows: (count 1) imprisonment for 7 years made up of a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months from 14 August 2007 and to expire on 13 February 2012 with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months; (count 2) imprisonment for 7 years made up of a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months from 14 August 2011 and to expire on 13 February 2016 with a balance of term of 2 years 6 months; (count 3) imprisonment for 7 years made up of a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months from 14 August 2015 and to expire on 13 February 2017 with a balance of term of 5 years 6 months. 
     
      
    7 In the result the applicant was sentenced to an overall period of imprisonment of 15 years from 14 August 2007 with an overall non-parole period of 9 years 6 months. The earliest date upon which the applicant can be considered for release on parole is 13 February 2017. 
     
      
    8 There are three grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. “The sentencing exercise miscarried because the applicant has been left with a justifiable sense of grievance in that he received a comparatively harsher sentence than did a co-offender, Barry Paul Cavanagh.” 
         
         
        2. “His Honour erred by failing to give proper effect to the principle of totality.” 
         
         
        3. “The sentences were manifestly excessive.” 
        
       
      
    9 The relevant facts can be summarised briefly. Each of the three offences was committed with a co-offender, Barry Cavanagh. Judge Morgan sentenced him for a number of robbery offences on 6 June 2008. He received an overall term of imprisonment of 14 years with an overall non-parole period of 10 years. An appeal to this Court against the sentence imposed was dismissed: see Cavanagh v R [2009] NSWCCA 174. 
     
      
    10 Count 1 on the indictment against the applicant related to an armed robbery committed when he and Cavanagh, each armed with a knife, entered a liquor store in Beverly Hills. The proprietor was threatened and robbed of money, his wallet and a mobile telephone. Count 2 related to an offence committed about a week later when both men, again armed with knives, entered a liquor store in Villawood and robbed the occupants of money and a mobile telephone. Count 3 related to an offence committed six days later when the two men, armed with knives, entered a liquor store at Peakhurst. They threatened the occupant intending to rob him but were unsuccessful. 
     
      
    11 The applicant was born on 2 March 1982. He has a criminal record dating from September 2000. In 2002 he was sentenced in the District Court on two counts of robbery in company to a total sentence of imprisonment for 2 years with a non-parole period of 7 months 7 days. In 2003 he was sentenced for one count of armed robbery to imprisonment for 5 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months. The applicant was released to parole on 16 December 2005. He was thus on parole for armed robbery when he committed these offences. 
     
      
    12 A pre-sentence report and a psychological report were tendered in the sentencing proceedings. His Honour stated, “I do not see anything in his background or upbringing relevant to his commission of the subject offences”. The Judge noted that the applicant was struck by a motor vehicle in 1999 and in the course of treatment received morphine for pain management. Thereafter the applicant became a user of heroin and this, his Honour said, “caused his descent into a life of crime”. 
     
      
    13 When released to parole, the applicant obtained employment with a firm in which a person, who had known the applicant over many years, held a managerial position. The applicant was described as a “good worker”. He is single and had a girlfriend for a few months before his arrest on 14 August 2006. Following his arrest his parole was revoked and he had the balance of his sentence to serve until 31 December 2008. 
     
      
    14 The Judge found there were a number of aggravating factors relevant to the determination of the sentences for the present offences including the fact that the applicant was on conditional liberty, the vulnerability of the victims and that the offences were part of planned criminal activity. He accepted that the applicant had the support of his family and employment available to him on release but stated, “his past drug use and criminal life do not instil confidence in me that he is motivated towards living a drug and crime free life”. The Judge thought that both specific and general deterrence were important. He also noted that he had to bear in mind parity with Cavanagh and, accordingly, noted similarities and differences between the two offenders. 
     
      
    15 The Judge considered the issue of totality and observed that the three offences were committed on separate occasions. He determined that there should be some accumulation between the sentences. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        As to special circumstances, I consider the facts that I intend to order that the first sentence commenced on a date after the date of the offender’s arrest and that the sentences be served partly concurrently and partly consecutively are special circumstances to justify a total non parole period of nine years six months and a total parole period of five years 6 months. 
         
        
       
      
    16 I intend to deal with the last ground of appeal first. This is because, if the sentences imposed are manifestly excessive, the Court must intervene and will address questions of totality and parity in imposing new sentences. I should indicate that there is no patent error in the sentencing of the applicant that operated to his detriment. The non-parole period is a lenient one as against the total sentence imposed and was not justified by the reasons given by his Honour. The applicant was to serve 15 years cumulative upon a year for his breach of parole: that is the equivalent of an over-all period in custody of 16 years from the date of his arrest. An application of the statutory relationship between the overall total sentence and the overall non-parole period would have resulted in a non-parole period of 12 years. Yet the applicant received an overall non-parole period of 10 years 6 months even though there were no special circumstances mentioned by his Honour that would justify such a reduction in the non-parole period from the statutory relationship. 
     
      
    17 In support of the third ground of appeal the applicant has called in aid sentencing statistics and they reveal, as is often the case, that the sentences actually imposed do not appear to reflect the statutory maximum penalty of 20 years. The sentencing statistics are frequently being used to displace the maximum penalty so that the sentencing court and this Court are being asked to have regard to the highest sentence that has been imposed in order to determine the appropriate sentence to be imposed in the instant case. The statistics indicate to me that the range of sentences being imposed for multiple armed robbery offences is too low. But the applicant was entitled to be sentenced in accordance with the actual range of sentences being imposed rather than by the range that this Court might think is appropriate. 
     
      
    18 A number of decisions of this Court were referred to in order to indicate that lesser sentences or comparable sentences have been imposed upon other offenders for more armed robberies. Where the appeal is by an applicant and the appeal is dismissed, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that this Court did not believe that the sentence was manifestly excessive. Some of the sentences on their face seem to me to be manifestly inadequate in light of the large number of offences for which sentence was being imposed or that were being taken into account. A number of the cases to which reference was made offer little guide to whether the sentencing discretion miscarried in this case because of the very different subjective factors being taken into account. 
     
      
    19 Of more significance are those cases where this Court has intervened. In TS v R [2007] NSWCCA 194 this Court found a number of errors of principle in the sentencing judges remarks and re-sentenced the applicant for five armed robbery offences where a knife had been used and taking into account matters on a Form 1. The applicant however was only 16 at the time of offending. The Court imposed sentences giving rise to an overall non-parole period of 3 years 6 months and balance of term of 1 year 6 months. Giles JA who delivered the principal judgment said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The sentences are markedly more lenient than would have been imposed on an adult offender. 
        
       
      
    20 In Qing An [2007] NSWCCA 53 the appellant was convicted after trial of 8 counts of armed robbery committed on massage parlours by the use of a knife in some offences and a replica pistol in others. He received an overall sentence of 12 years with a non-parole period of 10 years. This Court found that the sentences were manifestly excessive. The Judge had sentenced by increasing the sentences for particular offences even though the seriousness of the conduct in each case was the same and this was held to be an error of principle. So, for example, a sentence of 6 years was imposed for the first count but a sentence of 9 years was imposed for counts 9 and 10. It was held that sentences of 8 and 9 years were outside the available range and the overall sentence was excessive. There was also a consideration of parity with a co-offender. The appellant was sentenced to an overall term of 10 years and 6 months with a non-parole period of 7 years 6 months. Unlike the present applicant the appellant in that case was not on conditional liberty at the time of the offending. 
     
      
    21 There are other decisions of this Court where sentences have been reduced for multiple counts of armed robbery by two-person benches. With respect to the opinions of the judges comprising those benches, the sentences imposed appear to me to be manifestly inadequate as representing the seriousness of multiple armed robberies. For example, I cannot accept that an overall sentence of 9½ years with a non-parole period of 5½ years can adequately reflect the criminality of 7 armed robberies, 2 attempted armed robberies and 13 similar offences taken into account on a Form 1: R v Antecki [2001] NSWCCA 312. 
     
      
    22 However taking account of the sentences that have been considered by this Court and in particular the decision in Qing An, it does seem to me that the overall sentence imposed upon the applicant is outside the range that appears to have been established notwithstanding my view that the range is generally too low for sentences for a large number of armed robberies. 
     
      
    23 In relation to the ground based upon parity, in my opinion this Court should refuse to entertain such a ground of appeal in circumstances similar to this case. Cavanagh was sentenced for only one offence that he committed with the applicant. The other two offences were taken on a Form 1. True it is that Cavanagh received a fixed term of 4 years 6 months for that offence, being count 3 on the applicant’s indictment. But a fixed term represents the equivalent of a non-parole period and, in Cavanagh’s case, it was after a discount for a plea of guilty. Yet the applicant received a sentence with a non-parole period of 1 year six months for that offence after trial. Of course a strict parity argument cannot be sustained on that basis. 
     
      
    24 The real complaint is that Cavanagh received an effective sentence of 14 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 10 years for four offences of armed robbery and the joint offence committed with the applicant and having five offences of armed robbery, two of them committed with the applicant, on a Form 1. The applicant argues that he should have received a lesser sentence having regard to the greater criminality for which Cavanagh was sentenced. That is not, in my opinion, a legitimate sense of grievance arising from a lack of parity between co-offenders. It is no more relevant to compare the sentence imposed upon Cavanagh than it is to compare the sentence imposed upon some other offender who received a lesser sentence than the applicant did yet committed more offences. The argument in such a case is not concerned with parity but is one based upon a consideration of the available range. If the sentences being compared are within the available range and the difference is a result simply of the exercise of discretion within the range, there is no legitimate sense of grievance for this Court to address. 
     
      
    25 However, the sentence imposed upon Cavanagh does confirm the view that I had already formed that the overall sentence imposed upon the appellant is excessive. 
     
      
    26 In my opinion none of the individual sentences is excessive. A sentence of 7 years seems to me to appropriately reflect the criminality of the offence taking into account that the applicant was on parole at the time. The offences were aggravated as his Honour found and there was little by way of mitigation. The only basis for a finding of special circumstances is the fact that there will be an accumulation of sentences. In my opinion the overall non-parole period should be three quarters of the period the applicant is to spend in custody. The overall sentence should be 10 years with an overall non-parole period of 7 years 3 months. The non-parole period is three quarters of the 11 years sentence taking into account the 12 months accumulation with the balance of parole. The applicant will be eligible to be considered for release to parole on 13 November 2014. 
     
      
    27 I propose the following orders. The application for leave is granted and the appeal allowed in part. The sentence for count 1 is confirmed. In respect of count 2 the term of 7 years, made up of a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months and a balance of term of 2 years 6 months, is confirmed but is to date from 14 August 2009 with the non-parole period to expire on 13 February 2014. In respect of count 3 the sentence is quashed and in lieu a term of 7 years is imposed to commence on 14 August 2010 and made up of a non-parole period of 4 years 3 months to expire on 13 November 2014 and a balance of term of 2 years 9 months from 14 November 2014.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 BASTEN JA: The applicant was sentenced by Blackmore DCJ on a count of having sexual intercourse with a girl under the age of 16 years to a term of imprisonment of two years, of which one year, three months constituted a non-parole period. The circumstances of the offence, together with other matters taken into account in sentencing the applicant, are set out in the judgment of Howie J and need not be repeated.  
     
      
    2 When the matter came before this Court on 15 December 2009, orders were made granting leave to appeal, but dismissing the appeal. By way of further elucidation of the reasons given by Howie J (with which I agree) I would add the following comments in respect of each of the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Use of internet; planning offence 
      
    3 The first two grounds of appeal complained that the sentencing judge wrongly took into account as aggravating factors the use of the internet to establish contact and arrange for a meeting with the complainant and that there was a degree of planning of the offence. To treat such factors as matters of aggravation was erroneous, it was submitted, because the applicant held an honest belief that the victim was not under 16 years of age. 
     
      
    4 The factual basis for this complaint was uncertain. The sentencing proceeded on a set of “agreed facts” which included the statement that the complainant, some two months prior to the date of the offences, had told the applicant during an internet exchange that she was “15”. 
     
      
    5 The statement further contained the following propositions: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 10 June 2004 the defendant participated in a recorded interview, in which he claimed that at the relevant time he believed that the complainant was 16 years old. The defendant and the Crown accept that in the circumstances, this belief was not reasonable.” 
        
       
      
    6 This statement is ambivalent as to whether or not the applicant held a belief as to her age. It was not an ambiguity which could be resolved, in the absence of evidence. The sentencing judge did not seek to resolve it but rather stated that the applicant had “accepted by his plea that he was at least reckless as to the fact that she was below the age of sixteen at the time the offences were committed”: Judgment, p 4. 
     
      
    7 The manner in which his Honour took into account the state of mind of the applicant appears from the following passages (Judgment, pp 5-7): 
     
      
       
        
        “His decision to use this internet chat page must have been a conscious decision. His use of this internet site to make contact with girls or young women is a disturbing factor in the case. 
         
        … 
         
        The facts reveal the lengths that the offender went to [to] meet the complainant. There is evidence which suggests that he groomed the complainant to procure her consent to this intercourse. Of course the offences took place in a motel room in a country town in New South Wales. The offender paid for the room. He also brought with him photographic equipment to record the occasion. To my mind the evidence does disclose considerable planning on his part and that planning amounts to an aggravating factor on sentence.” 
        
       
      
    8 By referring to “this” internet chat page, his Honour was referring to the fact that the chat room “was advertised as being a place for 15 to 18 year olds to meet and chat via the internet”: Judgment, p 2. It is relevant that, whatever the correct age of the complainant, the applicant used a chat site on which he might expect to meet persons who were under 16 years of age. Further, the events which constituted the offence were clearly planned in the way described by the sentencing judge. No doubt the conduct of the applicant would have carried a higher level of moral culpability if he had known that the complainant was under 16 years of age. However, that he was merely reckless as to that state of affairs does not render either his use of the internet site or the planning of the events constituting the offence irrelevant. They remain aggravating factors, although the degree of aggravation may depend upon where the offender’s state of mind sits on the range from deliberate malice to inadvertence. There is nothing in the reasons given by the sentencing judge to suppose that his Honour used them in a way inconsistent either with principle or with the factual basis on which the matter proceeded. 
     
      
       
      Public opprobrium 
      
    9 In addressing the applicant’s personal circumstances, the sentencing judge noted (Judgment, p 9): 
     
      
       
        
        “He apparently had a bright future with a political party at the time of the offending. He has suffered the public denigration that naturally flows from the revelation of such an offence. In his case the denigration was more pronounced due to his public position as a counsellor. On the other hand the community expects and deserves high standards from their public representatives and naturally when offences as repugnant as those committed in this case are publicly revealed, there is a backlash against the public figure involved. I do not believe that such public humiliation is more than would naturally be expected given these offences and his public figure, such that the offender should be entitled to a finding that he has suffered extra curial punishment as a result.” 
        
       
      
    10 By the third ground of appeal, the applicant contended that his Honour should have taken into account, by way of mitigation of penalty, the fact that he had suffered “public denigration” and “public humiliation”. His Honour was wrong, the contention proceeded, to discount these factors on two bases, namely that there was an expectation of high standards from public figures and that the “backlash” was to be expected. 
     
      
    11 Although no complaint was specifically directed to the manner in which his Honour dealt with prior character, it is convenient to note that his Honour had taken into account (at p 8) the following circumstances: 
     
      
       
        
        “He has no prior convictions whatsoever, he can be treated as a person of prior good character, although good character is not a matter of substantial mitigation in cases involving sexual offences with children.” 
        
       
      
    12 In Melbourne v The Queen [1999] HCA 32; 198 CLR 1, a case not concerned with sentencing, both McHugh J at [33]-[35] and Gummow J at [62]-[67] noted the distinction between character and reputation, a distinction which also has relevance in relation to sentencing practice. As noted by McHugh J at [33]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In its strict sense, character refers to the inherent moral qualities of a person …. It is to be contrasted with reputation, which refers to the public estimation or repute of a person, irrespective of the inherent moral qualities of that person.” 
        
       
      
    13 The relevance of “good character” to sentencing for criminal offences has been questioned, as noted by McHugh J in Ryan v The Queen [2001] HCA 21; 206 CLR 267 at [30]. However, his Honour held that it was “an established mitigating factor in the sentencing process”: at [31]. It is helpful to ask why that is so and to note that there are potential justifications which are relevant in the present context. For example, prior good character may be relevant to determining the level of penalty necessary to constitute a sufficient deterrent for the individual offender. Thus, it may more readily be accepted that a person who has otherwise conducted himself or herself honourably and decently will be dissuaded from further criminality by a relatively lenient sentence. 
     
      
    14 Reputation may also be relevant to the extent that for a person with a high reputation, its destruction, taken in combination with a relatively lenient sentence, may again provide a sufficient individual deterrent. 
     
      
    15 Against those considerations, there are other principles which underlie the sentencing exercise, including a broader educative effect or general deterrence, and the satisfaction of a community sense of the need for retribution and the affirmation of the importance of the underlying prohibition which has been breached. 
     
      
    16 The separation of these differing factors will not give rise to any mechanical approach to sentencing, but it may give rise to greater clarity of thinking and reasoning on the part of the sentencing judge. That is no less important in circumstances where statute prescribes that the fact that an offender “was a person of good character” is a mitigating factor in determining the appropriate sentence: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW), s 21A(3)(f). In part that is because the Court must nevertheless have regard to such a factor only if it would not be contrary to a rule of law to do so: s 21A(4). 
     
      
    17 As noted by Gummow J in Ryan at [68], reputation and good character may both be relevant in sentencing. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “For example, where the offence is an isolated lapse representing human frailty or the offence is one of strict liability, to a person valuing a good reputation the mere fact of conviction may be a punishment. ‘Good character’ in such a case also may indicate the capacity of the person to appreciate the censure inherent in the outcome of the criminal process and may suggest that repetition of the criminal conduct is unlikely.” 
        
       
      
    18 It may also be important to distinguish the case where the person’s reputation is, apart from its destruction, independent of the offence and the case where the person’s reputation and office have been used or abused in the course of the criminal conduct. In the latter case, there may be good reason to disregard the destruction of reputation resulting from an abuse of trust: see R v Jackson and Hakim (1988) 33 A Crim R 413 at 436-437, referred to by Callinan J in Ryan at [176]. Callinan J, however, sought to qualify the principle stating, at [177]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Of course the abuse of an office to commit a crime is greatly to be deplored but the crime of a person occupying an office of some prominence will often attract much greater vilification, adverse publicity, public humiliation, and personal, social and family stress than a crime by a person not so circumstanced. When these consequences are attracted they should not be ignored by the sentencing court.” 
        
       
      
    19 The views of Callinan J in respect of public opprobrium in Ryan were shared by Kirby J in that case, particularly at [123]. His Honour acknowledged that “in cases of prolonged criminal activity, a previously demonstrated, or assumed, good character is of less importance than in other cases”: at [111] referring to R v Hermann (1988) 37 A Crim R 440 at 448. After referring to the public identification of the appellant in that case as a paedophile, his Honour continued at [123]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where this occurs, the stigma will commonly add a significant element of shame and isolation to the prisoner and the prisoner's family. This may comprise a special burden that is incidental to the punishment imposed and connected with it. If properly based on evidence, it could, in a particular case, be just to take such considerations into account in fixing the judicial punishment required.” 
        
       
      
    20 McHugh J in Ryan took a different view, noting the difficulty for a sentencing judge in assessing the degree of “public opprobrium” which would attach to an offence or a particular offender: at [53]. His Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the case of long sentences, taking into account the impact of public opprobrium or stigma would seem an impossible exercise and almost meaningless. In addition, taking public opprobrium or stigma into account would seem to favour the powerful and well known over those who were lesser known. I see no reason why the well known individual should get a lesser sentence than the person who is hardly known in his or her community.” 
        
       
      
    21 His Honour was at pains to distinguish public opprobrium from “the loss of a job or similar personal or financial loss”, being factors which his Honour thought could properly be taken into account: at [54]. No doubt the effect of such factors is more readily identifiable, but it must be the case that most offenders sentenced to significant terms of imprisonment will suffer such loss. It is not clear whether his Honour thought that the loss should be measured in absolute or relative terms, depending on the social status and rate of pay. 
     
      
    22 McHugh J also noted that “the worse the crime, the greater will be the public stigma and opprobrium”: at [55]. His Honour doubted whether “the objectively appropriate sentence” for the greater offence should be reduced by reason of the disparity in public opprobrium or stigma. 
     
      
    23 None of these factors and considerations operate in a clear and constant way. Each must be assessed according to underlying principles of retribution, deterrence and the need to ensure that the penalty fits the crime. 
     
      
    24 In the present case, it may be said that the reasons given by his Honour could have identified more explicitly how the various factors were taken into account. Nevertheless, it cannot be said that the particular considerations his Honour identified were in any respect irrelevant, nor is it apparent from the overall result that they were improperly taken into account. For these reasons, the third ground of appeal was also unsuccessful. 
     
      
    25 HOWIE J: On 15 December 2009 this Court made orders granting leave to appeal but dismissing the appeal. These are the reasons why I joined in those orders. 
     
      
    26 The applicant stood trial in respect of a number of child sexual assault offences. However after the trial commenced, but before the complainant gave evidence, he pleaded guilty to two counts of having sexual intercourse with a child between the age of 14 and 16 years contrary to s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act 1900. He also asked the sentencing judge to take into account three matters on a Form 1 in relation to the second count on the indictment. The matters taken into account were two further offences under s 66C(3) and an offence of aggravated indecent assault contrary to s 61M(1) of the Act. The maximum penalty prescribed for an offence contrary to s 66C(3) is imprisonment for 10 years. 
     
      
    27 On 13 February 2009 Judge Blackmore sentenced the applicant as follows: on the first count on the indictment he ordered that the applicant enter into a good behaviour bond for a period of four years under which he was required to undergo supervision with the Probation and Parole Service. On the second count and taking into account the matters on the Form 1, he sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of one year and three months to date from 13 February 2009 with a balance of term of nine months. The applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 12 May 2010. 
     
      
    28 There are three grounds filed in support of the application for leave to appeal: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The sentencing judge erred in holding that the fact that [the] applicant made contact with the complainant through use of the Internet was a factor that aggravated the offences. 
         
         
        2. The sentencing judge erred in holding that the offences involved ""significant planning"" and a factor that aggravated the offences. 
         
         
        3. The sentencing judge erred in holding that the applicant's ""public humiliation"" was not a mitigating factor in the form of ""extra curial punishment"". 
         
        
       
      
    29 There was an agreed statement of facts presented to his Honour. They can be summarised briefly. In 2003 the complainant, who was 15 years of age, being born in April 1988, moved from Urunga to Brisbane. At this time the applicant was aged 33 years. The complainant participated in a “chat room” on the Internet meant for persons between the ages of 15 and 18. She had a profile of herself that misstated her age as 16. 
     
      
    30 In October 2003 the applicant made contact with the complainant in the chat room. The applicant wrote. “ASL?” which was an acronym for “age, sex and location”. The complainant replied that she was 15, female and lived in Brisbane. 
     
      
    31 Contact between the two increased including by email and telephone. Over a period of six weeks the content of their conversations became increasingly sexual culminating in the complainant sending him photographs of herself and he sending her sexually explicit photographs of himself. 
     
      
    32 In December 2003 they arranged to meet in Urunga. The applicant travelled there and booked a motel room. Before they met and again at Urunga, the applicant told the complainant that sexual activity would only take place if she agreed to it. On 13 December 2003 they indulged in various acts of a sexual nature that gave rise to the offences before the sentencing Judge. These included both penile-vaginal and penile-anal intercourse. These acts gave rise to the first and second counts on the indictment. The latter act caused the complainant pain and the applicant ceased at her request. They took photographs of each other. The complainant was then aged 15 years and 8 months. 
     
      
    33 The complainant returned to Brisbane and remained in contact with the applicant by email and telephone in what was described as a “loving and caring relationship”. The complainant’s mother learned of their activity and notified the police. They commenced an investigation that included an officer posing as the complainant in communications with the applicant. The applicant was eventually arrested on 10 June 2004 with photographs of the complainant in his possession. 
     
      
    34 The agreed statement of facts contains the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        On 10 June 2004 the [applicant] participated in a recorded interview in which he claimed that at the relevant time he believed that the complainant was 16 years old. [The applicant] and the Crown accept that in the circumstances this belief was unreasonable. 
        
       
      
    35 The applicant had no prior convictions. There were in evidence psychological reports and a pre-sentence report. There is no suggestion that his Honour erred in the use he made of this material either in favour, or to the detriment, of the applicant. 
     
      
    36 The first ground of appeal refers to comments made by the Judge during the course of his sentencing remarks. The Judge quoted the following passage from my judgment in R v Dagwell [2006] NSWCCA 98: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [41]………… The offences of which the respondent has been convicted and the method of procurement of the supposed consent of the complainant are both serious and insidious. Users of Internet chat rooms should be well aware that crimes committed in such circumstances are treated with great concern by the criminal justice system and will be dealt with severely. Children must be protected from themselves and from those who prey on their vulnerability by gaining access to them through means such as that used by the respondent. The only way that this policy can be achieved is by the courts imposing condign punishment upon those convicted of such offences in the hope that others who are minded to act in the same way might fear the consequences if they are caught. 
        
       
      
    37 His Honour then went on: 
     
      
       
        
         
        For that policy to be implemented as stated, sentencing courts must pay particular attention to general deterrence when sentencing offences of sexual intercourse with children in circumstances where that sexual intercourse is procured through the use of the Internet. 
         
         
        To my mind to properly reflect the community's disapproval of this sort of activity and the policy outlined above by the Court of Criminal Appeal, this court is required to impose a sentence of full-time custody with respect to these offences. However it should immediately be acknowledged that the circumstances of this case are not on all fours with that in [ 
        Dagwell 
        ]. In that case the offences to which the offender pleaded guilty were more serious charges carrying a lengthier maximum penalty. The girl involved there was 13 years old, whereas in this case the complainant was 15. In [ 
        Dagwell 
        ] the court was dealing with a case involving two distinct occasions of intercourse, whereas here the offender had sex with the complainant admittedly in a number of different ways on the one occasion. 
        
       
      
    38 The submission made on behalf of the applicant is as follows. The agreed statement of facts was based upon the proposition that the applicant had a belief, albeit an unreasonable one, that the complainant was 16 years of age. The Internet was not being used to prey upon the vulnerability of the complainant arising from the fact that she was under the age of consent because the applicant believed, unreasonably, that she was over the age of consent. Therefore, the use of the Internet was not a relevant factor. 
     
      
    39 I am unable to accept the argument. The applicant, aged 33, entered a chat room designed for persons between the ages of 15 and 18. There was a substantial risk, therefore, that one or more of the participants would be under the age of 16. The applicant was clearly seeking out a young person for the purposes of sexual activity. He was told that the complainant was aged 15, although the agreed facts indicated that he had forgotten that communication. Presumably this was part of the reason why he accepted that his belief that she was aged 16 was unreasonable. 
     
      
    40 By his use of the Internet the applicant developed the relationship with the child and it was always a risk that she might misstate her age. If a person uses the Internet to both meet and then groom a person for sexual purposes, general deterrence applies if, as a result, he has intercourse with an under-aged child in circumstances that amount to a criminal offence. I do not see why the courts should not discourage such conduct. I see no error in what the sentencing judge said in this regard. 
     
      
    41 The second ground is that the Judge was in error in taking into account that the offences were planned. The argument in the written submissions is as follows: “Given that the applicant was sentenced on the basis that he honestly believed that the complainant was 16, it is impossible to see how there was any planning in the commission of the offence”. But the sexual acts between the complainant and the applicant were criminal, because his belief was unreasonable. Therefore his planning in order to commit the offences was to be taken into account as part of the circumstances of the offending regardless of the fact that he may have believed she was 16 years and that he was not committing an offence. This was not an offence occurring on the spur of the moment but was a result of forethought and planning. In my opinion it was open to the Judge to find the offences aggravated by the conduct leading up to their commission. 
     
      
    42 The third ground arises from the following passage in the Judge’s sentencing remarks: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The offender's personal circumstances can be dealt with relatively shortly. He does not claim other than a happy upbringing by caring parents. He apparently had a bright future with a political party at the time of the offending. He has suffered the public denigration that naturally flows from the revelation of such an offence. In his case the denigration was more pronounced due to his public position as councillor. On the other hand the community expects and deserves high standards from their public representatives and naturally when offences as repugnant as those committed in this case are publicly revealed, there is a backlash against the public figure involved. I do not believe that such public humiliation is more than would naturally be expected given these offences and his public figure, such that the offender should be entitled to a finding that he has suffered extra curial punishment as a result. There is no evidence of any additional penalty being meted out to the offender. To the contrary he remained in public office years after the revelation of these offences, which he now admits. 
         
        
       
      
    43 The written submission on behalf of the applicant is that, ""extra curial punishment should be taken into account regardless of whether it may ‘naturally be expected’"". However as developed in oral argument the complaint is that the Judge did not take into account the loss of the applicant’s political career.  
     
      
    44 There is little doubt that a court can take into account the effects upon the offender that have occurred as a consequence of the commission of the offence. It can be a financial loss, for example the loss of employment or superannuation benefits. It can be a physical injury that has occurred to the offender, for example serious injury to the driver charged with causing death or injury to some other person as a result of the use of a motor vehicle. But it can go further and include other types of disadvantages resulting from the offending. 
     
      
    45 In R v Allpass (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 the Court was concerned with a Crown appeal in respect of the digital penetration of the vagina of a 9 year old girl by a man aged 76. There was intense media coverage of the offence and the sentence imposed. The Court referred to some of the effects of the offence and its publicity as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The evidence showed that, following the events of 4 January 1992, the respondent and his elderly wife were subjected to a campaign of abuse and harassment, involving threats of serious injury to person and property. It should be added that the Crown concedes that it is relevant to the outcome of this appeal that this campaign intensified following the announcement of Judge O'Reilly's decision. It reached such a level that the respondent was forced into a psychiatric clinic for treatment, and, according to the evidence, he was pursued even there. The respondent and his wife have had to leave their home, removing their belongings under cover of darkness, and they now live elsewhere under assumed names. Quite apart from the decision of this Court, the respondent and his wife have paid a high price for his wrongdoing. 
        
       
       
      This was one of the considerations taken into account by the Court in determining to dismiss the Crown appeal. 
       
        
       
      
    46 The applicant’s original submission was that public humiliation could be sufficient to amount to extra-curial punishment. He relied upon R v Cobb [1999] FCA 158; 84 FCR 450. There a member of Parliament was sentenced for defrauding the Commonwealth as a result of claims he made as a parliamentarian. He received a suspended sentence and the Crown appealed. The sentencing Judge had remarked: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I must also take into account what Mr Cobb has already suffered for his crimes.... 
         
         
        Even if he is not imprisoned, he will have been very severely punished.  
        
       
       
      The Full Court in dismissing the appeal simply quoted this passage of the sentencing remarks without comment. It is not clear from the judgment what punishment the respondent had suffered and that was taken into account by the sentencing judge. 
       
      
    47 The applicant also relied upon R v Poynder [2007] NSWCCA 157; 171 A Crim R 544. That was a case involving a solicitor, aged 50, who had made telephone calls, some to chat services, where for his gratification he spoke about sexual matters including, for example, planning the rape of a five-year old child and bestiality. In dismissing the Crown appeal, James J stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        86 Some allowance could properly be made for the severe extra-curial punishment the respondent had suffered and would suffer, including the virtually certain loss of his profession of 25 years and his livelihood. Some allowance, albeit only limited, could be made for the public humiliation the respondent had suffered. 
         
        
       
      
    48 There was evidence in that case that the Legal Services Commissioner had initiated complaints against the respondent that, by reason of the conduct giving rise to the offences for which he was sentenced, the respondent was not a fit and proper person to hold a practicing certificate. The sentencing judge had acted on the basis that the charges would be pursued and the respondent would lose his profession as a solicitor.  
     
      
    49 Clearly that was a matter that could be taken into account as extra-curial punishment. My initial reaction was that public humiliation that arises from the commission of the offence should not alone give rise to a mitigation of sentence without more. However having regard to what Basten JA has written about this matter, the issue appears to be unresolved in the High Court and need not be determined for the purpose of disposing of this ground of appeal. Clearly there may be an exceptional case where it reaches such proportion that it has had some physical or psychological effect on the person so that it could be taken into account as additional punishment. That was in effect the position in Allpass. It was also the position in R v King [2009] NSWCCA 117 where media coverage of the respondent’s sentence resulted in threats to him and made him a virtual prisoner in his own home. 
     
      
    50 In so far as in the present case his Honour was not prepared to take into account as a mitigating factor the public humiliation suffered by the applicant, I agree with that view. But even if it were wrong, the impact upon the sentence would be very slight. 
     
      
    51 In any event I do not apprehend any error in what his Honour said about the effects upon the applicant in the passage quoted above. It was a matter for his Honour as a factual finding to determine whether the impact upon the applicant’s political career was a matter that should mitigate the sentence as extra-curial punishment. I am not persuaded he was wrong in the view he took on that issue. It should also be noted that in determining the impact upon the applicant of delay between the offence and sentence his Honour took into account the effect of the charges upon the applicant. He stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Some of the delay here can be explained by the fact that the offender pleaded not guilty initially. However that cannot explain the entirety of the delay. Moreover the offender had to endure the glare of public attention as a result of the charge. He had a public position at the time of the commission of the offences and naturally his charging with these offences was a matter of public interest and concern. I believe there is substance in the submission that the delay in this matter had been so extensive that some allowance be made for it in mitigation on sentence. 
        
       
      
    52 In my opinion none of the grounds of appeal have been made out. 
     
      
    53 JOHNSON J: On 15 December 2009, I joined in orders granting the Applicant leave to appeal, but dismissing the appeal. I agree with the judgment of Howie J and the additional comments of Basten JA.

   SENTENCE1 Clayton Kean appears for sentence today on a number of matters. The first of the matters for which he is to sentenced concerns an offence of aggravated break, enter and steal committed on 29 September 2008. Mr Kean went to some premises, he attempted to break in by removing a fly screen but was unsuccessful. He was then able to obtain a garden stake and put it through an unlocked dog door thereby reaching into one of the living rooms of the home hooking a bag and removing it. In doing so part of his body but not all of it crossed the line of the premises and so he broke into those premises and stole the bag and it’s contents.2 Mr Kean admitted doing all of that but denied doing so where a circumstance of aggravation was present, namely that he knew that the premises were occupied at the time. The trial was held before me, sitting without a jury, limited to that issue. In order to find Mr Kean guilty of the aggravated form of the offence it was not necessary for me to decide anything about Mr Kean’s actual mental state. It was enough, because of the way the legislation is framed, that I found that I was not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that any such belief would have been a reasonable one. For the purposes of sentencing him however I make the finding that, given the state of the premises, which I described in my judgment, I am satisfied that Mr Kean knew that it was most likely that a person was at home when the offence was committed. 3 He also is to be sentenced in relation to the stealing of a Mercedes motor vehicle. When he stole the bag it contained within it the keys to that vehicle. The day after the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal he returned to the premises and stole that motor vehicle using the keys he had earlier taken.4 Mr Kean is also to be sentenced for an offence of break, enter and steal that was committed in circumstances where Mr Kean did not believe and could not have reasonably believed that there were people present at the time even though in fact there were. When he is sentenced for that matter he asks that I take into account a further matter on a Form 1, that being the taking and driving of a conveyance without consent of the owner.5 The Form 1 offence was committed on 6 December 2008 while the break, enter and steal was committed on 11 December 2008. On that day he went to the Tony Ferguson Weight Loss and Wellbeing Centre, and entered the premises through a steel security gate. People who were present inside heard the door being opened and went to investigate. They found the offender standing next to the safe. They panicked and ran out the front of the store where they used a bystander’s phone to call police. In the meantime the offender had opened the safe and removed about $200 worth of notes and coins before running away. Police attended and discovered the offender’s fingerprint.6 The offender has been in custody, not continuously but for a total period of one year, two months, one week and five days referrable to these offences and so it is appropriate that I start the sentence I will shortly announce on 1 December 2008.7 Mr Kean is a person who has spent a great deal of his life in custody. He was brought up in Tasmania where he had troubles at school and developed a drug habit. In order to satisfy that habit, as is regularly the case, he resorted to regular offending. He has spent a great deal of this life in custody. Upon release he has no skills with which to support himself in the community and he soon re-offends. In fact both of these offences were committed whilst he was on conditional liberty. He was on parole at the time of the aggravated break, enter and steal and bail at the time of the break, enter and steal. He has been married but separated from his wife about six years ago. He has a son and tragically a daughter died whilst he was in custody. He has had another relationship with a woman in Tasmania which he describes as an on and off relationship.8 He said to the Probation and Parole Office in New South Wales that he left Tasmania in mid 2008 after he was released from custody there in order to make a fresh start. However as soon as he got to New South Wales he continued his transient lifestyle and needed to pay for both accommodation and drugs which he continued to use. It was in those circumstances that these offences were committed. He has not really made any efforts to rehabilitate himself and overcome his drug addiction. He was accepted into a rehabilitation facility, at one stage. This was upon release to bail but he simply did not go to the facility but relapsed into drug use. He now recognises, I suspect, the futility of the life that he has been leading. He seeks the assistance of the correctional authorities both in rehabilitating himself whilst in custody and in ensuring that he attends residential rehabilitation upon his release from custody.9 The offender has displayed a continuing attitude of disobedience to the law. In ordinary circumstances that would be a significant impediment to a finding of special circumstances made in his favour. On one view he has failed to take advantage of any leniency offered to him in the past and allowing him out any earlier than would be the case by the application of the statutory ratio would simply allow him to commit offences earlier than he would otherwise. But I will accept the offender’s invitation and do what I can to rehabilitate himself. 10 I will make a finding of special circumstances in his favour but on this firm understanding. Although it is not me who sets the conditions of parole it is my strong recommendation that upon the expiry of the offender’s non-parole period he be released to parole, a condition of which is that he attend a residential rehabilitation program. That will require the assistance of the Correctional Service authorities in obtaining a place for Mr Kean in such a facility as well as assistance in transporting him to that facility upon his release from custody. It may seem that Mr Kean is going to require a bit more effort put into him than some might think he deserves but I am not doing this as a favour for Mr Kean. I am doing this because I hope to promote his rehabilitation so that he does not commit any further offences. If that is the case then the community benefits and in particular the members of the community benefit.11 The aggravated break, enter and steal has a standard non-parole period of five years. The offence I am satisfied is lower than the middle range of objective gravity. It was a break, and enter only to the extent that Mr Kean put part of his body, his arm, through the dog door and although it was aggravated by the circumstance that the premises were occupied the person who was there at the time did not even realise she had been burgled until some time later. It was not a case where she confronted the offender in her home with all the attendant terror that that would entail. Another factor leading me to impose a non-parole period lower than the standard concerns the fact that it would be necessary for me to accumulate sentences in order to properly reflect the offender’s overall misconduct.12 The offender pleaded guilty to both the larceny of the Mercedes motor vehicle and the break, enter and steal and so I will impose a sentence that is twenty-five percent lower than would otherwise be the case. As Mr Buckman pointed out in objective gravity terms non-aggravated offence is probably more serious than the aggravated offence involving as it did Mr Kean entering the premises completely and stealing from a safe that was there after he had been seen by people working on the premises. Although I have been structuring an overall sentence I have decided to sentence the offender for the aggravated break, enter and steal sentence first. 
     
      
      MAGNUS: Can I interrupt your Honour? 
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: Yes have I made a mistake? 
       
       
      MAGNUS: No well we have but it’s not your mistake. The covering sheet indicates that the accused, the prisoner was on parole at the time. I’ve just worked it out, I think his parole had expired two days before. So when your Honour said he was on parole he was in fact not on parole. 
      
    13 HIS HONOUR: I withdraw the suggestion that the offender was actually on parole at the time he committed the aggravated break, enter and steal offence. However if the Crown’s new calculation is correct it was only a matter of days after the expiration of his parole that he committed that offence. That is consistent with what I have described as the offender’s continuing attitude of disobedience to the law and his re-offending soon after release from custody.14 For the offence of aggravated break, enter and steal committed on 29 September 2008 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 1 December 2008 and an overall term of four years. 15 For the offence of stealing the Mercedes motor vehicle on 30 September 2008 I set a fixed term of one year to date from 1 December 2010. For the offence of break, enter and steal committed on 11 December 2008 the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. Taking into account the Form 1 matter I set a non-parole period of two and a half years to date from 1 June 2010, the non-parole period will thus expire on 30 November 2012. I set a head sentence for that matter of five years.16 I refer the matter to the Drug Court for consideration as to whether the offender is eligible to enter the Intensive Drug Treatment Program at Parklea Gaol. 17 I dismiss both of the matters on the 166 certificate.

   JUDGMENT1. Nathan Riley is a young Aboriginal male. In March of 2008 he was twenty-one. He was living at Wellington. He had not been in trouble with the law. He had completed Year 12 at high school. He has a reasonable work ethic. As with many young men this age, he had bonded with a couple of mates including Nathan Ah See.2. On 15 March 2008 he was at a mate’s place and as I understand it, the local club drinking. He claims that he consumed more than twenty schooners over a twelve-hour period. That was not contested by the crown. He is a tall, heavy set young man. Even so, that quantity of alcohol he had consumed, he says, may explain why it was he participated in what was a group related activity of violence.3. He received information that his friend Ah See was involved in a fight. It does not appear Riley sought any further information, simply that he was willing to stand by Ah See’s side and participate with others in attacking and assaulting Richard Hutching without knowing the rights or wrongs of that matter. Riley has pleaded guilty to that assault which occasioned actual bodily harm to Hutchings, the assault being done whilst he was in the company of Ah See and two other men. Today he is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct. He asked when I sentence him that I take into account a further offence of affray arising from the same incident. That matter was originally to be a s 166 criminal procedure matter. I have been asked to allow the prosecution to withdraw it from the summary jurisdiction so that it may be taken into account on the Form 1. That seems a sensible approach.4. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence before this court committed by this offender harming this victim in the Wellington community. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to Riley, that is subjective matters, because I am dealing both with an offence and with an offender. 5. The starting point for assessments requires me to make findings of fact from evidence before the court relating to the offence and to the offender. My fact-finding task has been circumscribed in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts to which I shall shortly return. It is sufficient at this point that I remind the court that a judge is not a party to an agreed set of facts. The tender of those facts does not relieve him or her from the fact finding responsibility implicit in being a judge. It simply limits the material from which facts may be found. To the extent if it be the case that the facts, as agreed, do not reflect the actual events that occurred, it must be remembered the court can only find facts from evidence placed before it.6. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects need to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, Form 1 matters. I’ve just mentioned the backup charge brought from the Local Court which needs to be dismissed or withdrawn, and ultimately the term of imprisonment or other penalty that is to be imposed. None of that can be determined until the primary facts are determined.7. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against an imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community also needs to be determined. See R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740. 8. The facts as I find them to be are principally sourced from those agreed facts earlier referred to and evidence given by the offender.Agreed Facts9. About 12.45am, that is early on Saturday morning 15 March 2008, Richard Hutchings and Leanne Shepherd left the Wellington Hotel in Swift Street Wellington. They were walking to Shepherd’s residence in Swift Street. Hutchings was slightly intoxicated. Near the intersection of Warne and Percy Streets a motor vehicle in which Nathan Ah See was a passenger drove past. He was hanging out the window and called out, “Don’t fuck her, she’s got AIDS” or words to that effect. Other passengers in the vehicle were yelling, “Richard, Richard”. The vehicle continued past and performed a U-turn coming back to where Hutchings and Shepherd were walking. It stopped near Hutchings who then recognised Ah See from a prior matter.10. The occupants of the vehicle told the two of their intention to assault Hutchings. He responded, “I’m not going to fight you all at once”. Hutchings and Shepherd then commenced running to their residence at 44 Percy Street Wellington. Whilst running Hutchings telephoned his eighteen year old son, Kegan Smith, for help. He asked Shepherd to phone the police. He reached his front driveway to see Ah See and the other males chasing him.11. Riley and Mitchell Moylan left the Grand Hotel on foot and started walking past Cameron’s Park. As they proceeded the vehicle that earlier had Ah See in it drove past and a passenger told the two that Ah See was going to be in a fight. The two entered the vehicle and were driven to the intersection of Warne and Percy Street, a position near 44 Percy Street where Hutchings was heading. Hutchings saw Ah See reach over the front fence and arm himself with a timber fence paling. Ah See then ran at Hutchings who managed to take the paling from him. Hutchings then chased Ah See, Riley and Moylan some distance, however, Ah See turned and came at Hutchings again. The two men began to grapple each other and Hutchings had Ah See in a headlock. Riley and Moylan entered the fray. Hutchings swung the paling which connected with Ah See and Moylan. Riley and Moylan then started punching Hutchings causing him to fall in his driveway. 12. Meanwhile one Kylie West was sleeping nearby. He was awoken and told Riley was in trouble and made his way to the scene by car. Hutchings, meanwhile, released Ah See and Ah See again armed himself with the fence paling. 13. About this time West arrived. Ah See began hitting Hutchings with a paling while he was still lying in his driveway. West, Riley and Moylan started to punch and kick Hutchings while he was on the ground. Hutchings sought to rise to his feet on a number of occasions, however, the trio continued punching and kicking him while Ah See continued to strike him with the wooden paling.14. Kegan Smith arrived. He, as you will recall, was Hutchings’ son. He saw the four men assaulting his father, jumped the fence and immediately took on West. West and Smith began to struggle. As they began to struggle Ah See approached and hit Smith across the back of his head with a fence paling causing Smith to fall to the ground. One Josh Sutton known to both Smith and the offenders arrived and called for the assault on both Smith and Smith’s father to stop. Sutton helped Smith to his feet and led him to verandah where he helped him sit down. Hutchings was attempting to get to his feet. Riley kicked him causing him to fall again to the ground. West, Riley, Moylan started punching Hutchings again. Hutchings made his way to a location near the side verandah of the residence. At this location he was on the ground attempting to cover his head whilst still being punched and kicked. West, Riley and Moylan lifted a number of pot plants from the brick wall of a verandah and threw them, complete with plant and soil, against the side of the house causing the soil to spray onto the head of the victim.15. Kylie West’s cousin who was at the scene persuaded West to leave. Ah See returned to Hutchings and said, “Take his shoes, take his shoes”. One of Hutchings’ shoes was taken by one of the offenders. Moylan and Riley left on foot. Others left in a motor vehicle that Ah See had arrived in. Police arrived shortly after and commenced their investigations.16. Hutchings and his son were taken to hospital. Hutchings injuries included multiple large bruises and soft tissue swelling over the chest, back, abdomen, upper limbs, face, head and lower limbs. He had right eye sub conjunctival haemorrhage (traumatic rupture of small blood vessels in the eye), and left knee sprain. Kegan Smith was also injured.17. Throughout the whole of the incident Miss Shepherd feared for her safety. More than a year later Riley was arrested and charged. Riley did not know Richard Hutchings. Riley acknowledged in court that he always regarded kicking a victim on the ground as a low act and is ashamed that he stooped to that level of aggression. I would have thought he could have also included three or four onto one was equally a low act but he did not do so.18. Although he has not spoken to the man who was the victim, he has apologised to the victim’s son for his conduct. It would seem Nathan Ah See was a very troubled youth. The circumstances of his own arrest strongly suggests that. Sadly, he has taken his life, it is thought, motivated by his sense of rejection by important members of his family or extended family.19. West has been sentenced by his Honour Sir Robert Woods in this court on 25 September last to an eighteen month term of imprisonment suspended pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I will need to return to that matter later.Objective Criminality20. From the facts as he finds them to be a sentencing judge is required to assess, as I said, the objective criminality of an offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of this offender’s criminal conduct. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in this case with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of this offence is evaluated. Quite clearly objective criminality has an important, if not the major, impact upon the overall sentencing outcome.21. All persons are entitled to have the integrity of their physical person respected. Persons are entitled to walk the streets, even at night, without fear of violence to them. Those who defy or defile the physical integrity of a person and those who are about disrupting the peaceful enjoyment of walking at night are involved in anti-social conduct of a high order. It is the anti-social nature of their conduct that makes it criminal.22. Richard Hutchings and Miss Shepherd were the target of verbal abuse and slander. That, in turn, rapidly deteriorated into an affray. An affray that saw them both injured. That affray was constituted by a melee in which an outnumbered Hutchings was given an unmerciful beating by four or more young thugs. He was denied the safety of his home. He was attacked with a weapon, namely a wooden fence paling. It is about this time, that is early in the physical altercation, that the offender joins into the melee. 23. His first physical intervention appears to have occurred when his friend Ah See is held in a restraining headlock. Riley punches Hutchings a number of times. Moylan assists. Hutchings falls to the ground. It would appear at the time the offenders are joined by West. 24. The height of the attack appears to occur while Hutchings, lying in the driveway, is attacked by Ah See with the paling while Riley and others are punching and kicking him on the ground. That was not only ruthless, it was doubly cowardly. Hutchings was outnumbered by attackers and he was on the ground. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt this offender kicked Hutchings a number of times. This included occasions when Hutchings sought to regain his feet. 25. The arrival of Hutchings’ son, Smith, brought some relief in that West and Ah See focussed on Smith. Hutchings again tried to regain his feet at that time but was kicked by the offender. Once on the ground Riley resumed punching him. Clearly the attack by the offender was sustained through at least three stages of the fracas. The attack was sufficiently unbridled, the outnumbering of both Hutchings and Smith, the speed with which Smith was set upon by the group, would cause any reasonable bystander to fear for his safety and did cause Miss Shepherd so to fear. 26. This offender’s motive for joining the brawl lacked any merit simply because he was not there in defence of his friend, but in support of an unlawful assault, the reason for which he had not a clue, and in circumstances where he must have seen that Hutchings was outnumbered by at least four to one.27. The further measure of criminality is the impact of the injuries upon the victim. The injuries were widespread upon the victim’s body. His head had been a focus. Traumatic brain injury was a grave risk. Right eye sustained haemorrhage and all injuries would have needed time, perhaps more than a week, to abate.28. The factors raising the level of criminality include the numbers. One accomplice makes an offence an offence in company. In this case there were at least three accomplices and possibly one or two more. The presence of more than one, and I cannot be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt there were more than three accomplices, is an aggravating feature. The joining in an attack when a weapon is used makes the criminality more serious. The gratuitous nature of this offender’s attack upon Hutchings, whom he did not know, and for a reason he did know, makes his criminality more serious. The offence was ongoing through three phases, two of which occurred whilst his victim was on the ground. The extent of and lingering discomfort caused by the injuries constitutes a high level of actual bodily harm. Factors that mitigate the seriousness of the offending include the impulsive and opportunistic joining of the brawl, the decision made to join the unlawful conduct was made when the offender’s level of intoxication was such as to compromise his reasoning and judgment skills. His mood was more disinherited than it would have been had he been sober.29. Notwithstanding the mitigating features, the overall level of objective seriousness when all factors are considered is such as to call for a term of imprisonment.Subjective Factors, Background, Relationships, Family Dynamics30. The offender was twenty-one at the time of this offence. He has recently turned twenty-three. He is a single Aboriginal man raised and schooled in Wellington. He is the youngest of four children. He says his family do not have a good reputation in Wellington. His parents separated when he was four. He can use that absence of good reputation as an excuse to, in a sense, join or extent the bad reputation or he can use that bad reputation as a reason why he should do something about it to enhance it in the community.31. He has a supportive relationship with his mother and sisters. His fathers and uncles have been in and out of prison. He was seeking to do better, he says. He resides with his mother and three sisters. There is intermittent contact between him and his father. Ah See was an important contact for him. There does not appear to be any romantic involvement. He must be grieving over Ah See’s demise.Education, Training, Employment and Skills32. As earlier remarked, he completed Year 12 in 2001. To his credit he completed Certificate III in Conservation and Land Management at TAFE in Wauchope. That certificate was completed in the course of a traineeship which may have been funded by a Commonwealth grant. But for whatever reason that traineeship ended with completion of the course. He was part of a team installing insulation. His build would disadvantage him working in a confined area of a roof cavity. He lasted a couple of months but is contemplating returning to this. He worked in 2009 for a contractor. That lasted but a couple of days before he injured his back. He was given two weeks off work and returned to find he was no longer wanted as a contractor. 33. He is looking for work through an employment agency as I understand it.General Health34. He is a well-built heavy set young man who, as far as one can tell, is physically well. I have referred to the back injury he sustained but have assumed that he is fully recovered from that when the two weeks was up. There does not appear to be anything in his physical health profile that should impede his rehabilitation.Mental Health35. There is no mental health profile before me. He is likely to be unsettled by Ah See’s decision to end his life. I have not ruled out some reactive depression to his circumstances. It is likely he has missed a positive adult male image in his life thus far, which may have made his relationship with Ah See the more important. There does not appear to be any mental health pathology though that would interfere with his capacity to rehabilitate.Drugs and Alcohol36. I am not prepared to accept he has been completely frank to the court about his drinking habits. He claims he was drinking on the day of the offence. He claims that his drinking on the day of the offence was unusual for him. There is a 2009 offence of property damage that I have little doubt occurred at a time when he was inebriated. He told his counsel he is drinking less now but I have no means of verifying that evidence.37. He told Probation and Parole he began drinking at eighteen and is drinking on a daily basis and binge drinking on weekends. This is problem drinking and in my view he needs counselling. His evidence is he is willing to accept it. He will see I have relied upon that evidence when the final sentencing disposition is announced.Character and Criminal History38. He was a person of prior good character at the time of this offence. He has achieved much for a young Aboriginal man coming from a somewhat difficult background. His education level has reached secondary schooling level. He is still with his family and supported by them. He has a reasonable work ethic, although a low working skill base.39. He is troubled by alcohol but so far as I am aware there are no drug issues.40. Probation and Parole assessed him as suitable for a medium to low level of intervention by their service. While Probation and Parole did not feel he required supervision, my assessment of his rehabilitation issues puts his need for intervention as requiring greater assistance and some monitoring. If requested by Probation and Parole during the course of his sentence I will review that need.Attitude to Offence41. I am satisfied this offender has some insight into the cowardly conduct for which he stands accountable. It was so acknowledged in his evidence and by his early plea. I intend to give him the benefit of that early plea, not by discount but by the manner in which the term of imprisonment will be spent. Setting the Sentence42. I am conscious of a requirement by appellant courts that deterrence be a primal factor when finalising sentencing disposition. The sentence is also one in which rehabilitation and personal deterrence are hopefully balanced so that they may all work together, see R v Hearne (2007) 124 AcrR 457.Parity43. West was given an eighteen month suspended sentence. He was charged on indictment with two counts of assault occasion actual bodily harm. The targets of his assaults were both the father and the son. The affray was also taken into account on a Form 1.44. While his role in respect of Hutchings was less than this offender’s, West's criminality included a second victim and the injuries sustained by that second victim. They included lacerations requiring a suturing to the side of Smith’s head and a grazing to his arm and abdomen. Those injuries may not have been as serious as the ones sustained by Hutchings, although I note one is a wound. Given the two victims, overall West’s criminality must be greater than this offender’s. Neither offender had a prior criminal history. This offender may have had a marginally more favourable subjective history to be taken into account. It will not be a case of strict parity but I will be conscious of West’s sentencing outcome. This offender’s sentence will bear an appropriate proportionality to it.45. Nathan Riley would you just stand up for the moment please while I do the formal sentencing.46. Nathan Riley you are convicted of assaulting Richard Hutchings thereby occasioning to him actual bodily harm while you were in company of Nathan Ah See, Kylie West and Mitchell Moylan. I am about to sentence you for that offence. I take into account the matter on the Form 1. 47. I set an overall sentence of twelve months imprisonment. I am going to suspend that sentence conditional upon you accepting supervision of Probation and Parole for a twelve month period with provision for Probation and Parole to seek withdrawal of supervision if satisfied of progress made.48. You are to maintain full abstinence from alcohol for a period of six months and if you are choosing to resume drinking you may not do so before having discussed that course of conduct with Probation and Parole and discussing with them an appropriate and proper drinking strategy.49. You are to submit to random breath tests as required by Probation and Parole during that twelve month period, or such shorter time as is allowed, for the purpose of determining whether you are in breach of the condition that you not drink alcohol for the first six months.50. Any refusal of a publican, that is somebody running a hotel, to serve you because of a level of intoxication within the first six months of this bond will be considered a breach, will be deemed a breach of the bond.51. A breach of the bond will bring you back before me. Your solicitor will tell you that a breach of a s 12 bond, that is the bond you have got, for a suspended sentence, gives a Judge very, very little discretion to do other than revoke the bond and impose the sentence. These are much tighter bonds than a s 9 bond. You breach a s 9 bond and no action is taken. With these bonds, because you are on conditional liberty for a period of twelve months, any breach of the good behaviour, or the terms of the bond, the drinking is a term of the bond, must result, unless there are special circumstances, in incarceration. Do you understand that?OFFENDER: Yes your Honour.HIS HONOUR: 52. Right. It is a condition of your bond that you accept counselling by Probation and Parole including alcohol and if thought appropriate other drug counselling.  That bond may be entered before the Registry. Until you enter the bond you are imprisoned so you must remain in the custody. I will order you to remain in the custody of your solicitor rather than send you downstairs while it all happens. All right. That would be the alternate. Thank you.

    3 HARRISON J: Marcus Shane Collins seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him by Nield DCJ sitting at Gosford on 12 September 2008. On 12 December 2007 at Wyong Local Court the applicant had pleaded not guilty to one count of malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm under s 35(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 and one count of intimidation with the intention of causing a person to fear physical harm pursuant to s 545AB(1) of that Act. He was committed to stand trial on both counts to the District Court at Gosford. 
     
      
    4 On the same day the applicant pleaded guilty to three counts of common assault under s 61 and two counts of malicious damage under s 195(1)(a). Those matters were placed on a certificate prepared by the Crown pursuant to s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. 
     
      
    5 The jury found the applicant guilty on the intimidation charge and not guilty on the charge of malicious infliction of grievous bodily harm. His Honour sentenced the applicant on the count for which he was convicted and the counts to which he had pleaded guilty as follows: 
     
      
      1. Common assault committed on 15 May 2007 – imprisonment for 1 year, 1 month and 14 days, with a non-parole period of 10 months from 23 June 2007 to 22 April 2008 and a parole period of 3 months, 14 days from 23 April 2008 to 5 August 2008. The prescribed penalty for this offence is a maximum of imprisonment for two years when dealt with on indictment or a maximum of imprisonment for 12 months or a fine not exceeding $2200 or both if dealt with summarily. 
       
       
      2. Common assault committed 9, 10 June 2007 – imprisonment for 9 months with a non-parole period of 6 months from 23 April 2008 to 22 October 2008 and a parole period of 3 months from 23 October 2008 to 22 January 2009. The prescribed penalty for this offence is a maximum of imprisonment for two years when dealt with on indictment or a maximum of imprisonment for 12 months or a fine not exceeding $2200 or both if dealt with summarily. 
       
       
      3. Common assault committed 9, 10 June 2007 - imprisonment for 9 months with a non-parole period of 6 months from 23 June 2008 to 22 December 2008 and a parole period of 3 months from 23 December 2008 to 22 March 2009. The prescribed penalty for this offence is a maximum of imprisonment for two years when dealt with on indictment or a maximum of imprisonment for 12 months or a fine not exceeding $2200 or both if dealt with summarily. 
       
       
      4. Malicious damage to property committed on 9, 10 June 2007 – imprisonment for 6 months, 21 days with a non-parole period of 5 months from 23 August 2008 to 22 January 2009 and a parole period of 1 month, 21 days from 23 January 2009 to 12 March 2009. The prescribed penalty for this offence is a maximum of imprisonment for 5 years when dealt with on indictment or a maximum of 12 months imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $2200 or both if dealt with summarily. 
       
       
      5. Malicious damage to property committed on 23 June 2007 – imprisonment for 6 months, 21 days with a non-parole period of 5 months from 23 January 2009 to 22 June 2009 and a parole period of 1 month, 21 days from 23 June 2009 to 12 August 2009. The prescribed penalty for this offence is a maximum of imprisonment for 5 years when dealt with on indictment or a maximum of 12 months imprisonment or a fine not exceeding $2200 or both if dealt with summarily. 
       
       
      6. Intimidation committed on 23 June 2007 – imprisonment for 3 years with a non-parole period of 1 year, 8 months and 15 days from 7 May 2009 to 21 January 2011 and a parole period of 1 year, 3 months and 15 days from 22 January 2011 to 6 May 2012. The prescribed penalty for this offence was a maximum of imprisonment for 5 years or a fine of $5500 or both. 
       
      
    6 The total effective sentence was therefore 4 years, 10 months and 14 days commencing on 23 June 2007 and expiring on 6 May 2012. The total non-parole period is 3 years and 7 months commencing on 23 June 2007 and expiring on 21 January 2011. The earliest date upon which the applicant is eligible for release is 21 January 2011.  
     
      
    Grounds of appeal 
     
      
    7 In these circumstances the applicant relied upon the following three grounds of appeal: 
     
      
      1. The sentencing judge failed to have proper regard to the fact [that] all of the charges could have been dealt with in the Local Court. 
       
       
      2. The sentencing judge failed to assess properly, or at all, the objective seriousness of any of the offences that had been the subject of pleas of guilty in the Local Court. 
       
       
      3. The sentences are manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    Background 
     
      
    8 The applicant was born on 28 October 1971. He left school aged 14 years and 9 months and thereafter held various positions with different employers in between periods of imprisonment. He enjoys good physical health although he suffered a period of depression following the death of a close friend. He is single having never married and he has no dependants. He has had three long-term relationships, the last one being with Rene James-Bartlett , the victim in the present case. The offences all occurred in a period of just over five weeks between 15 May 2007 and 23 June 2007 in the context of the applicant's turbulent and abusive relationship with Ms James-Bartlett. The details of the offences are as follows. 
     
      
    9 Between 6.00pm and 7.00pm on 15 May 2007 the applicant assaulted her by punching her to the right side of her face. This was the first offence referred to in the s 166 certificate. 10 His Honour dealt with this at par [24] of the remarks on sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""24. The circumstances in which the [applicant] committed the first assault upon the complainant … are in dispute. The complainant complained that she was lying down on a verandah floor cowering from the [applicant] when he punched her to the right side of her face. The [applicant] said that he punched her to her face when she was standing in front of him and after she had punched him, after which she fell to the verandah floor. Although I doubt that I need to say who I accept, the fact that a right handed man punched the right side of a woman's face suggests that the complainant was not facing the [applicant] when he punched her and leads me to accept the complainant's version rather than the [applicant's] version of this incident."" 
        
       
      
    11 Between 7.00pm on 9 June 2007 and 2.10am on 10 June 2007 the applicant assaulted Ms James-Bartlett by pulling some hair from her scalp and by throwing a torch at her, which struck her on the bridge of the nose causing her nose to bleed. These were respectively the fourth and fifth offences referred to in the s 166 certificate. Between 7.00pm on 9 June 2007 and 2.10am on 10 June 2007 the applicant maliciously damaged a wooden door of a granny flat by kicking it open. This was the property of Ms Jennifer Allgood. This was the third offence referred to in the s 166 certificate. Between 2.00pm and 2.10pm on 23 June 2007 the applicant maliciously damaged a wooden door in a studio by kicking it open. This was also the property of Ms Allgood. This was the second offence referred to in the s 166 certificate. 
     
      
    12 His Honour dealt with these offence at pars [25] – [26] of the remarks on sentence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""25. The circumstances in which the [applicant] committed the other offences are not in dispute, although the [applicant] claims that he had a reason for his conduct towards the complainant on 23 June 2007, that reason being that he wished to recover his Keycard to assess [sic] his bank account, which card had been taken by the complainant, something which she denied. As I have said already, the evidence of the [applicant's] intimidatory conduct towards the complainant, which occurred in the presence and hearing of other people including the complainant's teenaged daughter, was overwhelming and I accept was committed by the offender when he was affected by alcohol and it was unrelated to his claimed reason. 
         
         
        26. The [applicant's] alcohol fuelled conduct towards the complainant on this occasion was abusive, aggressive and, to my mind, and to the mind of the jury, intimidatory. In the course of his conduct, which lasted, albeit with breaks, over many hours, he banged and kicked upon two doors leading into the studio, part of the premises, in which the complainant, her daughter and other occupants of the premises had locked themselves, damaging the doors. In short, he terrorised the complainant, her daughter and the other occupants of the premises."" 
        
       
      
    13 His Honour referred to the intimidation charge at par [27] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""27. The [applicant's] conduct in intimidating the complainant with the intention of causing her to fear for her personal safety shows that the offence is a serious domestic violence offence committed by one person in a relationship towards the other person in the relationship. Although the [applicant's] conduct could have been worse and, therefore, the offence more objectively serious, I consider that the [applicant's] offence falls well above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences of its kind."" 
        
       
      
    Consideration 
     
      
    Ground 1 
     
      
    14 Section 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act is in these terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""166 Certification and transfer of back up and related offences  
         
         
        (1) On committal for trial or sentence of a person charged with an indictable offence:  
         
          
           
          (a) the prosecutor must inform the Magistrate as to whether or not the person has been charged with any back up offence or related offence, and  
           
           
          (b) if the person has been charged with any back up offence or related offence:  
           
            
             
            (i) the prosecutor is to produce to the court a certificate specifying each back up offence and related offence with which the person has been charged, and  
             
             
            (ii) the proceedings on each back up offence and related offence with which the person has been charged are to be transferred to the court in which the person has been committed to trial or sentence (along with the certificate).  
            
           
          
         
         
        (2) This section does not prevent the person referred to in subsection (1) being charged with any offence after committal.  
         
         
        (3) Proceedings on a back up offence or related offence that are laid after committal for trial or sentence of a person charged with an indictable offence are to be transferred to the court in which the person has been committed to trial or sentence.""  
        
       
      
    15 The five charges to which the applicant pleaded guilty could have been dealt with summarily in the Local Court. The fact that they were not is the direct consequence of the operation of this section. The applicant complains that it is only because of an inadvertent and unintended procedural consequence in this particular case that the maximum penalties to which he became exposed were those that his Honour had regard to when sentencing the applicant for these offences, rather than the smaller penalties to which he would have been subjected in the Local Court. 
     
      
    16 In Ciaron McCullough v R [2009] NSWCCA 94, Howie J referred to what was said by Hall J in R v Palmer [2005] NSWCCA 349: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[25] The issue was also considered in  
        R v Palmer 
         [2005] NSWCCA 349 where Hall J at [15] summarised the relevant principles as follows:  
         
         
        (a) The first is that a judge in the District Court is not bound by the jurisdictional limit imposed on the Local Court when dealing with an offence on indictment which was capable of summary disposal, but may have regard to that limit when the case is one which could appropriately have been disposed of in the Local Court:  
        Regina v. Crombie 
         [1999] NSWCCA 297 at [16];  
        Regina v. LPY 
         (2002) 136 A. Crim. R. 237 at 240 and  
        Regina v. El Masri 
         [2005] NSWCCA 167 at [30]. 
         
         
        (b) Secondly, the fact that a matter could have been dealt with in the Local Court, had the prosecuting authority not elected otherwise, remains a relevant consideration in the exercise of the discretion reserved to the sentencing judge:  
        Crombie  
        (supra) at [15]. 
         
         
        (c) Thirdly, however, the relevant decisions that establish that principle do not go so far as to require the sentencing judge to proceed upon the basis that the maximum available sentence is that which could have been imposed in the Local Court. At most they establish that the circumstance identified is to be taken into account. Depending upon the objective and the subjective criminality of the offender, it may properly be regarded as calling for some mitigation of the sentence that would otherwise be imposed in the District Court for an offence prosecuted upon indictment. Where it appears that that circumstance has been entirely overlooked by the sentencing judge, it may properly justify the granting of leave to appeal:  
        Crombie 
         (supra) at [16]. 
         
         
        (d) Fourthly, the significance of the loss of the chance of the matter being dealt with in the Local Court varies from case to case. In some cases it would contribute to mitigation of sentence. It is a matter to be taken into account, but is not a universal factor for the reduction of sentence:  
        Regina v. Doan 
         (2000) 50 NSWLR 115. 
         
         
        (e) Fifthly, the failure by a sentencing judge to mention the matter in his or her remarks on sentence and the length of the sentence does not necessarily establish that the sentencing judge failed to have regard to the matter. In some circumstances the length of the sentence may not suggest that the matter was overlooked:  
        Regina v. Depoma 
         [2003] NSWCCA 382 at [17]. 
         
         
        (f) Finally, in circumstances where a sentencing judge has made no reference to the summary disposal argument in his or her remarks on sentence, it is necessary to consider whether that omission is indicative of error. One way of testing that proposition is to consider whether the sentence itself appears manifestly excessive in all the circumstances of the case – if the factor had been taken into account and given appropriate weight, a substantially lesser sentence was appropriate in the case:  
        El Masri 
         (supra) at [45] per Johnson, J. (with whom Hunt, AJA. and Hulme, J. agreed)."" 
        
       
      
    17 Howie J dealt with the instant case at par [26] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[26] Although, unlike the situation in  
        El Masri 
        , the Judge in this case did indicate that the two offences could have been dealt with in the Local Court, there needed, in my opinion, to be a closer analysis of the situation because of the reduced maximum penalties that would apply, they being less than the normal jurisdictional limit in the Local Court of 2 years imprisonment. As her Honour noted, both these offences were to the lower end of the scale of seriousness. In my opinion the sentence for the malicious damage was excessive having regard to the nature of the offence and in light of the fact that it exceeded the sentence that the Local Court could lawfully have imposed had it been dealt with in that jurisdiction. The sentence for the assault was also manifestly excessive. The applicant should be re-sentenced for these two offences."" 
        
       
      
    18 All of the offences that are the subject of the present application are listed in Table 2 of Schedule 1 to the Criminal Procedure Act so that by virtue of s 261 of that Act the offences would have been dealt with summarily in the absence of an election by the prosecution. The offence charged under s 35(1)(b) was an offence listed in Table 1 of Schedule 1 and the prosecution made an election for a trial on indictment. The applicant was ultimately acquitted on that charge. The applicant contended that the relative lack of objective seriousness of the remaining offences was such that no election would have been made in respect of them in the absence of the s 35(1)(b) allegation and that each of these offences would have been dealt with summarily in the Local Court. 
     
      
    19 Apart from his reference to the differing maximum penalties provided for each offence, when dealt with summarily or on indictment, his Honour limited his remarks on sentence on this issue to the following: 
     
      
       
        
        ""41. I record that I realise that the sentences could have been dealt with by a magistrate in a Local Court but, in my view the [applicant's] criminal record for the use of violence, including violence against the complainant, I well understand the position taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions that the offences be dealt with in this Court rather than in a Local Court."" 
        
       
      
    20 In fact, apart from the two matters for trial, the Director could not be said to have taken any such position or approach. On the contrary, the balance of the matters was before the District Court by reason of the operation of s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act as earlier discussed. 
     
      
    21 The applicant submitted that his Honour did not have proper regard to the applicable maximum penalties that would have been available had the matters been dealt with in the Local Court, nor did he undertake a ""closer analysis"" in the way found to be desirable by Howie J in McCullough. He submitted that on the basis of this ground alone the Court's discretion to re-sentence is enlivened and that it should proceed to do so. 
     
      
    22 However, all of these arguments can be put to one side. It is regrettable that neither counsel appearing at the trial nor counsel appearing in this Court drew attention to s 168(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act. It provides as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        168 
          
        Procedures for dealing with certain offences related to indictable offences 
          
         
         
        (1) …  
         
         
        (2) …  
         
         
        (3) In sentencing or otherwise dealing with a person for a back up offence or related offence, the court has the same functions,  
        and is subject to the same restrictions 
         and procedures, as the Local Court."" [Emphasis added] 
        
       
      
    23 In the absence of any argument on the point it seems that this subsection had at least the effect of restricting his Honour’s powers when sentencing the applicant in the following ways. First, by restricting the maximum penalties that could be imposed by his Honour to those applying in the Local Court. Secondly by restricting his Honour’s power to accumulate such sentences beyond a period of three years. 
     
      
    24 The sentences that were imposed by his Honour with respect to the matters to which the applicant pleaded guilty should have been calculated having regard to s 168(3) of that Act. His Honour was constrained by the maximum penalties applying in each case in the Local Court. The sentences that were in fact imposed were therefore arrived at erroneously. The applicant should be re-sentenced for this reason alone. 
     
      
    Ground 2 
     
      
    25 His Honour made a specific determination of the objective seriousness of the intimidation offence at par [27]. However, although his Honour made some general observations about features of aggravation and the impact of the applicant's record of domestic violence, there is no assessment made in relation to the objective seriousness of the remaining offences. 
     
      
    26 His Honour made some general observations at par [32] of the remarks on sentence when considering mitigating factors that provided some guidance as to the probable assessment of objective severity. The applicant submitted that his Honour did not discharge his obligation to do so with respect to each separate offence. In this regard his Honour said, ""as to all the offences other than the offence of intimidating the complainant, the mitigating factors are (a) because the injury to the complainant and the doors was not substantial, (b) the offences were not planned being more spur of the moment …"". 
     
      
    27 The applicant contended that given the limited facts recited in the remarks on sentence, his Honour would have been obliged to assess the objective seriousness of the offences to be low. If his Honour had properly assessed the objective seriousness of these related offences the applicant submitted that he would have imposed sentences that were considerably reduced. He was in error in the circumstances. He also submitted that on the basis of this ground alone the Court's discretion to re-sentence is enlivened and that it should proceed to do so. 
     
      
    Ground 3 
     
      
    28 With respect to the intimidation offence the applicant emphasised that JIRS statistics revealed that of 1142 cases dealt with by the Local Court between March 2007 and December 2008, 13 per cent resulted in sentences of full time imprisonment with a total of 62 per cent receiving either fines or bonds. Of the 13 per cent that were imprisoned, 2 per cent were sentenced to 2 years imprisonment (the jurisdictional maximum), 25 per cent attracted 12 months and 60 per cent attracted a range of between 1 month and 9 months. 
     
      
    29 Even accepting the assessment that the offence fell ""well above the middle range of objective seriousness for offences of this type"", as found by his Honour, the applicant submitted that a sentence of 3 years full time imprisonment was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    30 The applicant also submitted that the common assault offences were manifestly excessive. He sought to compare the circumstances of the present case with those in R v Abboud [2005] NSWCCA 251 and McCullough. The applicant contended that these offences were low on any scale of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    31 The applicant submitted that the malicious damage offences were also manifestly excessive taking into account his Honour's findings of a lack of substantial damage and lack of planning. 
     
      
    32 With respect to the overall sentence the applicant did not contend that his Honour failed to have regard to the principles of totality as required by Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610. The significant degree of partial accumulation between the sentences that were imposed contributed to a total sentence that was manifestly excessive and that a lesser total sentence is warranted in law. 
     
      
    Conclusions 
     
      
    33 Alike with Howie J in McCullough, I consider in this case that the sentences for the malicious damage offences were excessive having regard to the nature of the offences and to the maximum sentence that the Local Court could lawfully have imposed had the offences been dealt with in that jurisdiction. The objective facts of these offences may have been difficult to assess in isolation from the events that surrounded them. However, the extent and degree of the damage to the doors when taken at face value ought not in my opinion to attract non-parole periods of imprisonment of 5 months in each case. His Honour was in error not to have had regard to the maximum sentence for these offences that could have been imposed if the applicant had been dealt with summarily. Sentences in each of these cases of nearly 7 months where the Local Court jurisdictional limit was 12 months are manifestly excessive. The applicant should be sentenced in each case to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 months. I consider that a fixed term, equating to what would otherwise be a non-parole period of 2 months, is appropriate when one has regard to the principles of totality and to the overall level of criminality involved in all of the offences. 
     
      
    34 The sentences for the assaults were also manifestly excessive, but to dissimilar extents. The earlier assault on 15 May 2007 involving punching the complainant is the more serious of these offences. However, having regard to the fact that this offence could have been dealt with summarily, the sentence is disproportionate to the maximum sentence that could have been imposed for the offence in the Local Court. Having regard to a maximum sentence of imprisonment of 12 months in that jurisdiction I consider that the applicant should be sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 6 months. Once again I consider that a fixed term, equating to what would otherwise be a non-parole period of 6 months, is appropriate when one has regard to the principles of totality and to the overall level of criminality involved in all of the offences. 
     
      
    35 The assaults that respectively involved pulling the complainant's hair and throwing the torch at her (which would appear in fact to have been a pen with a light as opposed to a full-sized torch as ordinarily understood) do not involve a degree of objective seriousness that should attract head sentences of 9 months in my opinion. Once again, having regard to the fact that these offences should have been dealt with by reference to the maximum penalties applying in the Local Court, I consider that the applicant should be sentenced in each case to a fixed term of imprisonment of 4 months. I once again consider that a fixed term, equating to what would otherwise be a non-parole period of 4 months, is appropriate when one has regard to the principles of totality and to the overall level of criminality involved in all of the offences. 
     
      
    36 The applicant attacked the sentence on the intimidation charge upon the basis that first, as a matter of comparison, it is excessive in statistical terms. The applicant has conceded the frailty of any reliance upon statistics alone. His Honour assessed the offence to be well above the middle of the range of seriousness for offences of this type. The applicant did not however contend that his Honour was in error in this respect, but submitted secondly that having regard to the sentence that could have been imposed for a like offence in the Local Court it was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    37 In the absence of a specific challenge by the applicant to his Honour's assessment that the offence was well above the middle of the range for this offence, about which minds may arguably differ, the important fact to emphasise is that the applicant was tried on indictment in the District Court. No controversy attends that fact. The applicant cannot legitimately complain that his Honour, in imposing a sentence by reference to the maximum sentence that could be imposed in that jurisdiction, failed properly to advert to the comparable penalty in the Local Court for the same offence as a relevant consideration in the circumstances. In this regard I have taken account of what was said by Johnson J in McIntyre v R [2009] NSWCCA 305 at [62] – [64] and [66] – [67] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[62] The relevant principles have been stated in a number of decisions of this Court, including  
        R v Crombie 
         [1999] NSWCCA 297;  
        R v Gent  
        (2005) 162 A Crim R 29 at 45-48 [76]-[91];  
        McCullough v R  
        [2009] NSWCCA 94 at [22]-[26];  
        Edwards v R 
         at [47]-[49]. There is no fixed rule when an argument based upon possible summary disposal is advanced, nor is this a factor which operates universally to reduce sentence. The bare theoretical possibility of the matter being dealt with in the Local Court does not suffice:  
        Edwards v R 
         at [47].  
         
         
        [63] Ought the s.58 offence be regarded as one which was truly a Local Court offence being prosecuted in the District Court:  
        Edwards v R 
         at [49]?  
         
         
        [64] It has been observed that, where the Director of Public Prosecutions has elected to prosecute a matter on indictment, it would require a very clear case of inappropriate prosecution of an offence on indictment for an argument to be available in mitigation resulting from a lost opportunity for summary disposal of that offence:  
        Edwards v R 
         at [49]. The Applicant had a lengthy record for offences of violence, including a number of offences of assault police or assault officer other than a police officer. No doubt, the Applicant's criminal history was taken into account by the Director of Public Prosecutions in electing to prosecute the s.58 offence on indictment. 
         
         
         
         ***** 
         
         
        [66] I do not think that this is a case where, in effect, the s.59 offence has dragged the s.58 offence into the District Court for sentence. Rather, the s.58 offence was far from trivial, and was committed by an offender with a history of persistent offending of this type. It was reasonable that a view be taken by the Crown that the Applicant ought stand for sentence for these two crimes of violence before the District Court, with the penalties available to that Court being open.  
         
         
        [67] Once the relevant principles with respect to the availability of summary disposal are taken into account in this case, it is clear that the theoretical possibility of the s.58 offence being disposed of summarily, does not assist the Applicant on sentence. Although I am satisfied that the sentencing Judge erred in excluding this factor from consideration upon an inappropriate basis, the factor does not ultimately assist the Applicant when it is taken into account in accordance with relevant principles."" 
        
       
      
    38 However, even disregarding the apparent sentencing trends for this offence, and his Honour's assessment of the comparative seriousness of the circumstances in this case, it does seem to me that the sentence imposed by his Honour was manifestly excessive. A review of the events of the night in question bears this out. 
     
      
    39 On Friday 22 June 2007 the applicant had been drinking quite heavily as he usually did. The complainant said that she was at that time coming to the end of her rope and said that she could not take any more. She said to the applicant that it was either she or the drink and that he had to decide. He said, ""What you mean you'll leave?"" and she replied, ""If I have to, I will."" 
     
      
    40 The complainant's daughter came to their house for the night. They went out for dinner with her daughter and some others to what appears to be a local club. Over dinner an argument developed in circumstances that are described in the following answer given by the complainant in her evidence in chief: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. So did anything happen around about 7pm or thereabouts? 
         
         
        A. Yeah, Marcus had been, he was quite intoxicated when we were down there and I asked him whatever he wanted to have for dinner, I would get, he couldn't make a decision and then he stormed off and then he would come back, anyway the girls had – he said just get whatever I wanted and he would share mine, I got a Caesar salad and the girls had some wedges and things like that, when he eventually sat down with us, the girls and him started having like a, well him and Stevie-Lee started having a bit of ice fight, and then it progressed to chips, and Shakeel started getting a bit scared, she could see things were escalating a bit, and she had asked him to stop it, that he was carrying on like a child, and he then got upset with her and started to raise his voice at her, which instantly terrified Shakeel after what we've been through with him, I proceeded, I grabbed the girls and started to leave."" 
        
       
      
    41 By this time they had been at the club for about one and a half hours. She ""grabbed the girls"" but the applicant ""continued to carry on in the foyer"". She called a taxi and went home. She planned to get anything that was important to her from her bedroom and put it in the office ""because [she] knew that [the applicant] would smash it"". This included ""photos of the kids and anything like that"". She had just finished doing this when the applicant walked in. He was alone. Six other people apart from the complainant and the applicant were in the house at that time. 
     
      
    42 The following question and answer are instructive: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Now when the [applicant] came home, did he do anything? 
         
        A. Yeah he started ranting and raving straight away and got all my things, my clothes and that, that were left in the bedroom and threw them all out in the front verandah, I instantly I just grabbed the girls and took them in the office and locked the doors, or Dave actually came down and locked the doors."" 
        
       
      
    43 The applicant was on the other side of the door ""hurling abuse and trying to kick his way in the door"" so they ran upstairs to the attic to try to be safe. They remained in the attic for ""hours"". Thereafter the complainant described what happened up until the point when the applicant was finally arrested in the course of the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Q. Were you aware whether anybody else came home during the course of the evening? 
         
        A. We'd been trying to get a hold of Jen for hours, to try and get her to come home, because we knew she would be the only one could settle him down. 
         
         
        Q. When you say we, who were we? 
         
        A. Me and the other people in the attack, Dave, Shannon, Shannon's cousin. 
         
         
        Q. How were you going back trying to get hold of Jen? 
         
        A. From the office we were trying to ring Jenny on her mobile, Mingara, and then Jenny's friend, Debbie, because we thought she might be able to go and get hold of her, eventually Jen came home about midnight. 
         
         
        Q. When she came home, do you know where the accused was at that stage? 
         
        A. Somewhere in the house. I don't know we were still locked inside. 
         
         
        Q. Once Miss Allgood came home, did you speak to her? 
         
        A. She came in the office, yeah. 
         
         
        Q. And did you see the accused at any point after Miss Allgood came home? 
         
        A. Marcus kept trying to kick the door in to the office, he wasn't allowed to come in there. 
         
         
        Q. Did he have any discussions with his aunt, Miss Allgood? 
         
        A. Yes Jenny sat in the lounge room with him, for quite some time trying to talk to him. 
         
         
        Q. Did you leave the attic or the office area? 
         
        A. No, we couldn't leave there for 24 hours. 
         
         
        Q. Did you get any sleep that night? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. Did things quieten down at any stage? 
         
        A. For a very short brief times and then he would start again. 
         
         
        Q. Did anybody else call at the house during the course of the night? 
         
        A. We had the police come out twice. 
         
         
        Q. Did you see those police officers? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. On both occasions? 
         
        A. Yes. 
         
         
        Q. Did you talk to them at all? 
         
        A. We all did, yes. 
         
         
        Q. And you say the police came on two occasions, they obviously left on two occasions? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q. What were things like on the first occasion when they left, what was going on in the house at the time they left? 
         
        A. Marcus was trying to kick the door in. 
         
         
        Q. Sorry? 
         
        A. Marcus was trying to kick the door in. 
         
         
        Q. Was that as the police were leaving? 
         
        A. No while the police were there, he was very good. 
         
         
        Q. The police left and then? 
         
        A. It would start again. 
         
         
        Q. The police were called back the second time? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q. Do you know who did that? 
         
        A. Who called the police? 
         
         
        Q. Yes? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. I take it that means it wasn't you? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. When the police called on the second occasion what happened as a result of their visit on that occasion? 
         
        A. I begged them, if they weren't going to take him from the house, could they at least get my daughter and I into a refuge so we could get out and everyone else would be all right. They refused to do that, they then left, we tried to get his best friend Steve Godbold to come and get him. Steve came and yeah didn't do much good with him at all, because Marcus was back and it had all started all over again, it went on all night. 
         
         
        Q. Once daylight arrived, what happened? 
         
        A. It was still going, I still couldn't leave the room. 
         
         
        Q. Now when did you eventually get out of the room? 
         
        A. When Mark was arrested. 
         
         
        Q. Did you get out the room before he was arrested or -- 
         
        A. He had kicked the other side, there's two doorways to the office, there is an internal door, and there's an external door, outside the house, he kicked the outside door in and while he did that, Amanda and I who were sitting in the office, ran out the other door, because we thought he was coming in through the door. 
         
         
        Q. Now you have just mentioned Amanda, is she another resident of the house? 
         
        A. Yes she was. 
         
         
        Q. And she got into that room at some stage? 
         
        A. Yeah. 
         
         
        Q. And do you recall how she came to be in there? 
         
        A. I think one of the others had let her in through the door. The others could come and go through that door without him worrying. It was only me he wanted. 
         
         
        Q. Yes. Now were you doing anything in the room immediately prior to the accused kicking the door in? 
         
        A. Amanda and I were sitting on the, we had a mattress in there that we all stayed in there to sleep on. Amanda and I were sitting on the end of the mattress, she's just come home, and she was talking to me about what had gone on. 
         
         
        Q. And when the accused you said he came to the door and kicked it in, was there anything said or any conversation before the door was? 
         
        A. Marcus accused Amanda and I of having a sexual relation in the bedroom while this was going on, which wasn't happening, and that's when he proceeded to kick the door in. 
         
         
        Q. Now you have already told us that when that happened you existed [sic] via the other door? 
         
        A. We ran straight out, yeah. 
         
         
        Q. And where did you go once you got out? 
         
        A. Out onto the back deck. 
         
         
        Q. Now did the accused do anything? 
         
        A. He came back through the other side of the house, around, and when he kicked that door in he came back in through the front door of the house and then to the other side of the deck. 
         
         
        Q. Now did Amanda do anything as you – 
         
        A. Amanda called the police straight away. 
         
         
        Q. And did the police arrive? 
         
        A. Yes they did. 
         
         
        Q. Do you know how long after she made the call that happened? 
         
        A. Five to ten minutes, not even ten minutes, yeah. 
         
         
        Q. Now in between the time when she called the police and when they arrived, where was the accused? 
         
        A. He was trying to get all the other people in the house had blocked him from getting out to me, he was trying to get through them, and then he proceeded, when he couldn't do that, and he was hurling horrible horrible things across to me and my daughter, he then went across to the phone box and was starting to ring me and say them. 
         
         
        Q. When you say he was hurling horrible horrible things, are they objects or words? 
         
        A. Words, yeah."" 
        
       
      
    44 Nothing can be said about these events that cast them in any light that would not have shown them to be very frightening and very harrowing for the complainant and those who were with her. In forming a view of the appropriate penalty, however, regard must be had to at least the following matters.  
     
      
    45 First, no specific threats appear to have been made. Once again it is important immediately to recognise that unspecified or unarticulated threats may be as troublesome and intimidating, and in some respects more so, than verbal abuse alone or even verbal abuse in association with acts that are physically threatening. In this case the applicant does not appear to have communicated with the complainant that she was in danger of some particular physical harm that he was contemplating or describing. It is unnecessary to observe that such threats are regrettably often made in specific and terrifying terms in similar situations. 
     
      
    46 Secondly, the complainant had the benefit of physical isolation from the applicant. Despite the applicant's violent attempts to kick down the doors of the rooms in which she took refuge, he was unsuccessful. Once again, the very concern that he would or might succeed would have fuelled the complainant's fears and offered her little comfort at the time of these frightening events. However, the circumstances are distinguishable from those where the complainant, or someone in an equivalent position, was wholly vulnerable to the unrestrained violent whim of the applicant. 
     
      
    47 Thirdly, the complainant was not alone throughout her terrible ordeal. The applicant had neither by chance nor design been able to isolate the complainant from her companions so that in the events as they occurred the intimidation to which she was subjected was at least partly mollified by the support of others who were with her. At least one of these was a male. 
     
      
    48 Fourthly, the complainant and those others who were with her would appear to have been able to contact the police either directly or indirectly by phone. She was not wholly unable to communicate with anybody beyond the rooms in which she was confined. This is patent from the fact that the police attended the premises on two occasions during the whole incident. The complainant was not completely isolated from or deprived of even the prospect of obtaining assistance or telling others of her plight. 
     
      
    49 Finally, the fact that the police attended the scene during the course of the events that give rise to the intimidation charge provides some insight into the state of affairs when they arrived. The complainant said that the applicant was behaving while the police remained but reverted to his aggressive conduct when they left. The complainant clearly did not at that stage at least feel inclined to seek protection from the applicant by leaving the scene, although in so saying I am not unmindful of the social and interpersonal pressures and dynamics that operate in such circumstances. In short, however, the situation was not apparently so bad at the time of the police attendance on the first occasion to have led to the applicant's immediate arrest. This must be taken into consideration in any assessment of the applicant's conduct.  
     
      
    50 In these circumstances it seems to me that in the overall scheme of things the imposition of a sentence of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months is manifestly excessive. I agree with his Honour's assessment that the applicant's conduct ""could have been worse"". 51 Some lesser sentence is warranted in law. 
     
      
    Orders 
     
      
    52 In these circumstances I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Grant leave to appeal against sentence. 
       
       
      2. Allow the appeal. 
       
       
      3. Quash the sentences imposed upon the applicant by his Honour Nield DCJ on 12 September 2008 and in lieu thereof sentence the applicant as follows: 
       
       
        
         
        (1) Common assault committed on 15 May 2007 – imprisonment for 6 months from 23 June 2007 to 22 December 2007.  
        
       
       
        
         
        (2) Common assault committed 9, 10 June 2007 – imprisonment for 4 months from 23 December 2007 to 22 April 2008.  
        
       
       
        
         
        (3) Common assault committed 9, 10 June 2007 - imprisonment for 4 months from 23 April 2008 to 22 August 2008.  
        
       
       
        
        (4) Malicious damage to property committed on 9, 10 June 2007 – imprisonment for 2 months from 23 August 2008 to 22 October 2008. 
        
       
       
        
         
        (5) Malicious damage to property committed on 23 June 2007 – imprisonment for 2 months from 23 October 2008 to 22 December 2008. 
        
       
       
        
         
        (6) Intimidation committed on 23 June 2007 – imprisonment for 1 year and 6 months with a non-parole period of 1 year and 2 months from 23 December 2008 to 22 February 2010 and a parole period of 4 months from 23 February 2010 to 22 June 2010. 
        
       
      
    53 The applicant's total effective sentence therefore is 3 years commencing on 23 June 2007 and expiring on 22 June 2010. The total non-parole period is 2 years and 8 months commencing on 23 June 2007 and expiring on 22 February 2010. The applicant will become eligible for release on 22 February 2010.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL and Howie J: We agree with Harrison J that the appeal to this Court cannot succeed for the reasons given by his Honour. However we would refuse leave to appeal. 
     
      
    2 The applicant had no prospect of the Court intervening to impose a lesser sentence even if she had convinced this Court of error by the sentencing judge. The sentence for the first offence was a fixed tem of 16 months. It commenced from 2 October 2007. As a sentence standing alone, although lenient, no argument could be made against it, the 16 months being, presumably, the equivalent of a non-parole period. However the second sentence commenced on 2 April 2008, that is 6 months after the commencement of the first sentence. 
     
      
    3 While accepting that the structuring of sentences and the determination of the totality of criminality are matters of discretion, we cannot accept that an effective sentence of 6 months was appropriate to reflect the criminality of the first offence. In the final result the applicant received a total sentence of 5 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months, for the whole of the criminality involved in two serious drug offences, one committed in May 2007 and the other committed in October 2007 when she was on bail for the first offence. This was a lenient sentence. 
     
      
    4 When seen in the light of the total sentence imposed having regard to the totality of the applicant's criminality, there was no reasonable prospect that this Court would intervene to reduce the overall sentence imposed upon the applicant because no lesser sentence could possibly have been warranted. Had it been necessary to reduce the length of the second sentence, we would have started it at a later date in order to maintain the overall sentence imposed by the sentencing judge.  
     
      
    5 All too frequently applications are brought to this Court where there is no merit because there is no prospect of this Court reducing the sentence. This is either because the particular sentence is unduly lenient or because the overall sentence imposed barely, if at all, reflects the overall criminality committed by the applicant. This is a very good example of an application that is entirely without merit for this reason. 
     
      
    6 The order we propose is that leave to appeal is refused. 
     
      
    7 HARRISON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against the severity of her total sentence of 5 years and 4 months imprisonment imposed by Frearson DCJ in the Sydney District Court on 28 August 2009. The sentence comprised a non-parole period of 3 years and 10 months and a balance of term of 18 months. The non-parole period expires on 1 August 2011. 
     
      
    8 The applicant pleaded guilty on 4 December 2008 to the following offences: 
     
      
      Count 1 
      : On 23 May 2007 at Bathurst of supplying a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, contrary to s 25(1) of the  
      Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act  
      1985 
      . The maximum penalty for the offence of supplying not less than the indictable quantity of methylamphetamine is 15 years imprisonment or a fine of 2000 penalty units or both. For this offence the applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for 16 months from 2 October 2007. 
       
       
      Count 2 
      : Between 1 October 2007 and 31 October 2007 at Bathurst of supplying a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine, on more than three separate occasions for financial reward contrary to s 25A of the Act. The maximum penalty for ongoing supply is 20 years imprisonment or a fine of 3000 penalty units or both. For this offence the applicant was sentenced to imprisonment for 4 years and 10 months from 2 April 2008 comprised of a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months with a balance of term of 18 months. 
       
      
    9 Neither offence attracts a standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    10 The applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
      Ground 1 
      : His Honour erred in not accepting as a matter of mitigation the circumstances of the applicant's drug addiction from a young age. 
       
       
      Ground 2 
      : His Honour erred in not adjusting the overall non-parole and parole period sufficiently for special circumstances after indicating there were special circumstances. 
       
      
    Facts 
     
      
    11 The facts were agreed. On 23 May 2007, police attended the applicant's home with a search warrant. The applicant promptly admitted that she had a quantity of methylamphetamine secreted in her bra. The drug was later analysed and found to be 24.2g of methylamphetamine or just under five times the prescribed indictable quantity. The applicant was arrested and remained in custody for this offence until 19 June 2008 when she was granted bail. It was a condition of her bail that she abstain from illegal drug use. 
     
      
    12 On 11 October 2007 a number of listening devices were lawfully installed by police at the applicant's home. Conversations were recorded and video footage of the premises was obtained. This established that between 13 October 2007 and 29 October 2007 the applicant had engaged in 51 separate acts of supplying methylamphetamine to various people. 
     
      
    Findings 
     
      
    13 His Honour found that the first offence involved a significant quantity of the drug and warranted a sentence that would deter others from such conduct. He found that the second offence was particularly serious in light of the frequency of dealing, the repetition and total number of transactions together with the level of organisation and amounts involved. His Honour considered that the offence concerned very substantial drug dealing from the applicant's home and the magnitude of the operation was also very substantial. 
     
      
    14 The motivation for both offences was financial gain. His Honour indicated, however, that as financial reward was an element of the second offence it was not double counted. The appropriate discount for the plea of guilty was 17 per cent. 
     
      
    15 His Honour considered that the applicant's antecedents, which included drug related convictions in 1990, 1994, 1998 and 2002, and violence related convictions in 1991, 2001 and 2004 manifested an attitude of continuing disobedience. His Honour found that the breach of bail was a significant aggravating factor, particularly in view of the fact that the second offence was committed whilst the applicant was at liberty on bail for the first offence. 
     
      
    16 His Honour considered that the applicant's disadvantaged background was to be taken into account. He considered that this background was some explanation for the behaviour but did not diminish the objective gravity of the offences. Whilst there was some nexus between the past hardships endured by the applicant and the offences in question, the applicant's moral culpability remained high if not very high. 
     
      
    17 His Honour indicated that the community would not tolerate the extent of drug dealing in which the applicant had engaged and needed to be protected from it. His Honour was unable to conclude that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend or that she had good prospects for rehabilitation. The only significantly mitigating feature in terms of the sentence was the applicant's plea of guilty and the extent of her cooperation with the authorities. His Honour found that there was no satisfactory evidence of remorse. 
     
      
    18 His Honour found special circumstances based on the accumulation of sentences and the necessity for counselling for illicit drug use, alcohol abuse and gambling addiction. 
     
      
    The applicant's subjective case 
     
      
    19 The applicant was born in 1972 and turned 35 between the commission of the first and second offences. His Honour highlighted the fact that the applicant's background included a history of addiction to gambling, alcohol and drugs. She had a history of childhood sexual assault and she had experienced domestic violence perpetrated by her father. The applicant has a daughter and a son who are both on Aboriginal scholarships in boarding schools. 
     
      
    20 The applicant began using cannabis at the age of 13 and smoked it daily. She used amphetamines regularly from 2006 when her partner burnt the house down. 
     
      
    Ground 1 
     
      
    21 The applicant's submission was stark. She contended that the sentences imposed by his Honour were such that he could not have taken into account the circumstances of the applicant's drug addiction from a very young age which, if properly accepted as a matter of mitigation, would have resulted in a lower sentence. The failure by his Honour to use the findings that he made about this aspect of the applicant's background to reduce the sentence that he imposed was said to be an error. 
     
      
    22 The applicant referred to the decision of this Court in SS v R; JC v R [2009] NSWCCA 114 in which the Court reiterated the general rule that the fact of drug addiction is not a mitigating factor. The Court, however, noted that there were exceptions to this principle: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[102] The Judge was stating the general rule that the fact of drug addiction is not a mitigating factor 
        : R v Henry 
         (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. The occurrence of a drug addiction at a very young age has, however, been recognised as an exception to the general rule:  
        R v Henry 
         per Wood CJ at CL at [273]. As was said by Hulme J in  
        R v Todorovic 
         [2008] NSWCCA 49 at [58]:  
         
          
           
          'In R v Henry (1999) NSWLR 346 this Court considered at length and firmly rejected the proposition that, in general, addiction to drugs should be regarded as a mitigating factor. In doing so the Court recognised that there would be cases where the general rule would not apply, for example, where the addiction was the result of youth …' 
          
         
         
        [103] JC told his Honour during his testimony that he commenced smoking cannabis on a daily basis when he was 11 years old. Byrne had supplied him with prohibited drugs which included methylamphetamine, 'LSD' and cannabis when he was 16 years old. This evidence was not rejected by his Honour. In these circumstances JC's drug addiction could be regarded as a matter of mitigation."" 
        
       
      
    23 The applicant's submission was not that his Honour did not advert to the fact that the applicant began using drugs from an early age. Indeed, his Honour's remarks on sentence specifically refer to the fact. The burden of the applicant's submission is simply that his Honour gave insufficient weight to the matter, as evidenced by the sentence he imposed. This is clearly enough a challenge to an exercise of discretion upon well known principles made plain in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; (1936) 55 CLR 499. At the risk of unnecessary reproduction, it is instructive to repeat what was said in that case at 504-505: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The manner in which an appeal against an exercise of discretion should be determined is governed by established principles. It is not enough that the judges composing the appellate court consider that, if they had been in the position of the primary judge, they would have taken a different course. It must appear that some error has been made in exercising the discretion. If the judge acts upon a wrong principle, if he allows extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect him, if he mistakes the facts, if he does not take into account some material consideration, then his determination should be reviewed and the appellate court may exercise its own discretion in substitution for his if it has the materials for doing so. It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred."" 
        
       
      
    24 The applicant's submission is limited to the propositions that his Honour failed to take into account the applicant's use of drugs from an early age as a material consideration and/or that the result at which he arrived is unreasonable or plainly unjust. The difficulty for the applicant in making that submission, however, is that it relies upon no more than the decision that his Honour made to support it.  
     
      
    25 There is no doubt that minds may differ about what weight should be given to particular matters that are germane to the sentencing equation. There is equally no doubt that a complete failure to advert to something as fundamentally important as the influence upon the applicant of a premature introduction to illicit and addictive drugs would constitute error on the part of a sentencing judge. In the present case the applicant relies upon the perceived problem with the sentence as evidence of the error. The argument is circular. The sentence may equally reflect consideration and accommodation of the very matters that the applicant contends should have been considered. In crude terms, the sentence may well have been longer in the absence of the matters that the applicant emphasises. 
     
      
    26 The maximum sentences for each of the offences are substantial. The nature and extent of the criminality, including the number of transactions, involved in the second count are also substantial. The sentence is not to my mind unreasonable or plainly unjust. It has not been demonstrated, and I do not accept, that his Honour failed to take account of any material consideration. Nor can it be demonstrated that he did not take account of matters when he specifically referred to them in his remarks on sentence. It is of no consequence that some other judge may hypothetically have sentenced the applicant in a different way. No error has been demonstrated. 
     
      
    27 In my opinion the first ground of appeal is without merit. 
     
      
    Ground 2 
     
      
    28 In R v Sutton [2004] NSWCCA 225, Howie J commented at [30] in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[30] His Honour found special circumstances and reduced the ratio between head sentence and non-parole period from the statutory ratio of 75 per cent to about 70 per cent. This meant a reduction in the non-parole period by about three months after the applicant had served four years six months in gaol. With respect, this rather makes a mockery of a finding of special circumstances in response to the need his Honour found for 'extended supervision and counselling'. I believe that the non-parole period should be four years."" 
        
       
      
    29 The applicant sought to embrace his Honour's remarks as having some applicability to her case. She argued that the extent of his Honour's variation of the statutory ratio in this case also made a mockery of the finding of special circumstances. She submitted that proper effect was not given to the finding of special circumstances. I disagree. 
     
      
    30 His Honour specifically referred to special circumstances in his remarks on sentence. He said this: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I do find special circumstances because of the accumulation of the sentences and the necessity for counselling for illicit drug, alcohol and gambling."" 
        
       
      
    31 Special circumstances are not limited to the question of whether or not the particular offender needs an extended period of supervision. The primary question should be the length of the minimum period of incarceration: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; (2001) 53 NSWLR 704. If special circumstances are found, the ratio between the non-parole period and the additional term needs to be taken into account, rather than simply leading to an increase in the additional term: R v P [2004] NSWCCA 218 at [24] and [26]. In other words, a finding of special circumstances should not normally lead to the imposition of a total longer sentence, but should lead to a shorter non-parole period and a longer parole period. 
     
      
    32 A finding of special circumstances is purposive, in that it is a warrant for reducing the non-parole period below the statutory ratio. Consideration of factors giving rise to a finding of special circumstances is not always limited to the rehabilitation of the offender but will often be the purpose for such a finding: R v El-Hayek [2004] NSWCCA 25; (2004) 144 A Crim R 90 at [105]. 
     
      
    33 Can it be said in the present case that his Honour's finding of special circumstances was not carried through in the sentence that he imposed? In the particular circumstances of this case, does a reduction of the non-parole period by only 2 months constitute a failure by his Honour properly or adequately to reflect the finding? 
     
      
    34 Counsel for the applicant drew in this context upon the comments of Anita Duffy, a psychologist, in a report concerning the applicant dated 10 March 2009 in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        ""She has since completely detoxified in custody and is able to reflect on this period in her life with some horror. She is aware that she needs further help to deal with difficulty in controlling her emotions and managing her behaviour patterns that led her to abuse drugs, alcohol and to gamble. Her Anxiety Disorder which appears to have been evident since childhood needs to be addressed comprehensively through counselling, relaxation techniques and cognitive behaviour therapy. 
         
         
        Sharon would benefit from a personal development programme addressing issues of abuse, low self esteem and trauma. She may also benefit from a more comprehensive programme in a rehabilitation centre for women such as at Phoebe House, to deal explicitly with these issues underlying her drug taking. 
         
         
        Upon release Sharon will require Probation and Parole Supervision and support. She wishes to move to a different area and will have accommodation needs for herself as well as the children. She would benefit from further counselling in the community, to focus on parenting issues as her children have all been affected by their separation from her. She also requires specific counselling to manage and control her emotions and behaviour. 
         
         
        Sharon's average level of intelligence indicates a potential for training in skilled employment which could be useful, as it would not only keep her occupied during the day but also give her some feelings of satisfaction and focus. She would benefit from work training though the Job Network or Centrelink Personal Support Programme. Sharon is at a stage in her life where she is motivated and ready to work on her problems constructively, to undo the damaging effects of the past."" 
        
       
      
    35 These matters were promoted by the applicant as support for the existence of error in his Honour's approach and for a corresponding further reduction of the non-parole period. The applicant submitted that such further reduction should be ""significant"". 
     
      
    36 In response, the Crown emphasised what was said in R v Simpson at [73]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[73] One practical effect of the statutory proportion has been to create a field of disputation which enables matters of fact and judgment to be expressed as if they constituted propositions of law. This arises only because the fetter is expressed in words which suggest a legal standard. It will be a very rare case in which there is no fact capable as a matter of law, of constituting a 'special circumstance'. The decision is first one of fact - to identify the circumstances - and, secondly, one of judgment - to determine that those circumstances justify a lower proportionate relationship between the non-parole period and the head sentence. There are well known restraints on an appellate court from interfering with decisions of this character. As a practical matter there are unlikely to be many cases in which this Court will interfere unless the non-parole period is found to be manifestly inadequate or manifestly excessive."" 
        
       
      
    37 The Chief Justice also had cause to comment on this issue in R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[31] In my view the size of such an adjustment raises so many matters of a discretionary character that this Court should be very slow to intervene. The specific grounds upon which his Honour found that special circumstances existed, as quoted above, were the strong prospects of rehabilitation and the need for extended supervision to monitor the Applicant's drug status and to attempt general rehabilitation. The first factor is a matter that was taken into account by his Honour in determining the head sentence. There is a real prospect of double counting. His Honour increased the period of supervision on parole by about 20 percent. So far as I can see there is no proper basis for challenging that increase as inadequate."" 
        
       
      
    38 In the present case his Honour increased the parole period by one eighth or 12.5 per cent. He was presumably influenced in doing so by his expressed inability to conclude on the evidence before him that the applicant was unlikely to re-offend or that she had good prospects of rehabilitation. On the basis of those findings it is apparent that his Honour considered that the adjustment to the statutory ratio should not be significant. It is also apparent that his Honour gave the matter careful consideration and that he structured the overall sentence to provide what he considered to be an appropriate relationship between the parole period and the total sentence. Eighteen months on parole is not an insignificant period having regard to the particular circumstances of the applicant. In Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49 a very small departure from the statutory ratio was considered not to be inappropriate. 
     
      
    39 The non-parole period in this case cannot in my view be described as manifestly excessive. I am unable to detect a proper basis for challenging as inadequate the decrease in the non-parole period on account of special circumstances. The sentence cannot be described as unreasonable or plainly unjust. I can detect no error in his Honour's approach or in the conclusion to which he came. 
     
      
    40 This ground of appeal fails.Orders 
     
      
    41 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Leave to appeal is granted.

    2 HOWIE J: I agree with Davies J. 
     
      
    3 DAVIES J: The Applicant pleaded guilty on 8 October 2008 that between 11:37pm and 11:48pm on 30 August 2007 at Newcastle he did break and enter the department store of David Jones in Hunter Street Newcastle and steal property valued at $29,889.85 contrary to s 112(1) Crimes Act 1900.  
     
      
    4 On 14 November 2008 he was sentenced by English DCJ in the District Court to imprisonment for 3 years and 9 months with a non-parole period of 2 years, 9 months and 27 days commencing on 26 June 2008 (the date of his arrest) and the non-parole period expiring on 21 April 2011. The maximum penalty for the offence is 14 years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period.  
     
      
    5 The facts and circumstances giving rise to the offence are set out by her Honour as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 30 August 2007 at about 9.30pm the premises of David Jones  
         
        Department Store in Hunter Street, Newcastle, were locked and secured by staff. Checks were also made of the home office electrical section of the store and it was observed that there was no damage to cabinets and all cabinet doors were locked. 
         
         
        At approximately 11.30pm on 30 August 2007 the offender gained entry to the department store via the multistorey car park. On the ground level entry to the car park wires were cut to the electrical control box for the metal roller door. 
          
        On the first floor of the car park, the entry/exit doors to the store, metal frames, glass panel doors and metal fire door were damaged, and tool marks were later observed by police around the lock and frame areas. The door alarm sensors were also cut. A small silver-coloured Energiser brand torch and a metal pipe were later located by police near the doors. 
         
         
        Inside the department store on the second floor the offender smashed a number of glass display cabinets and numerous items of property were stolen, consisting of video, photographic, computer and navigational equipment. The total value of the property stolen was $29,889.85. 
         
         
        Blood was detected by police on one of the glass cabinet doors and a swab was taken by police for forensic analysis. DNA testing was carried out by the Division of Analytical Laboratories on the swab taken from the glass cabinet door and a reference sample taken from the offender. The offender was found to have the same profile as the DNA recovered from the swab. This profile is expected to occur in approximately one in 6.2 billion individuals in the general population.” 
        
       
      
    6 The Applicant was born on 16 November 1971 and was aged 35 at the time of the offence and is now aged 38.  
     
      
    7 He has an extensive criminal history dating back to 23 February 1988 including a number of offences involving break, enter and steal. At the time he committed the offence the subject of the appeal he was on parole for an offence of common assault and had been released from custody on 25 May 2007. That parole was revoked for other reasons and he served the remainder of the sentence from 13 October to 27 November 2007 in custody.  
     
      
    8 On 18 January 2008 he was sentenced in the Newcastle Local Court for a number of offences include break and enter a building and commit an indictable offence. For that he was sentenced to imprisonment for 9 months to commence on 22 December 2007 to expire on 21 September 2008 with a non-parole period of 6 months to expire on 21 June 2008. He was released on 21 June 2008 only to be arrested on 26 June 2008 for the offence the subject of this appeal.  
     
      
       
      Subjective features 
       
      
    9 Her Honour noted the relevant subjective matters with respect to the Applicant as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “He was raised in a dysfunctional family environment and was the victim of child sexual assault. Whilst he is able to nominate the perpetrators and identify his co-complainants his attempt to bring the matter to the attention of authorities has been thwarted by his inability to be specific as to times and dates. He has discussed the matter with a co-complainant. 
         
         
        He is currently in a supportive relationship with the mother of his young child. She remains supportive whilst he remains drug-free and crime-free. If he chooses drugs and offending behaviour she will not support him. 
         
         
        He has spent a significant period of time in custody. He says because of his current classification and location at Grafton Gaol it is difficult to access drug and alcohol counselling. On a prior occasion whilst he was at Wellington Correctional Facility he was able to access work and programs and he participated in both. 
         
         
        He acknowledges that drugs are his downfall and so too are negativepeers. He says he is trying to reduce his methadone so that when he is released he will not mix with the criminal elements who are also on methadone programs and with whom he has contact when he attends to receive his methadone. He acknowledges a need to enter residential rehabilitation and says that he will do so whether court-ordered or not. He needs to turn his life around. 
         
         
        His son is his motivating factor. He does have another child from a previous relationship but has nothing to do with that child. That relationship was apparently marred by drugs. 
         
         
        His education was disrupted due to the abuse he experienced as a child. He understands that his drug addiction is, more probably than not, as a result of that abuse also. He says at the time he committed this offence he was bingeing on benzodiazepines.” 
        
       
      Remarks on sentencing 
       
      
    10 Her Honour having noted the subjective matters, made reference to the Applicant’s lengthy criminal antecedents. She described him as having an appalling criminal record and a record which included offences of a like nature. She said that served to demonstrate that the offence was not an uncharacteristic aberration but a course of criminal conduct that demonstrated a manifest disobedience of the law. She said issuesof retribution, denunciation and protection of the community loomed large as a consequence. He was on conditional liberty at the time and was not entitled to any further leniency.  
     
      
    11 She said the offence was objectively serious having regard to the value of the property stolen, the damage occasioned to the premises and the fact that he was on conditional liberty at the time but took into consideration that the premises were commercial premises and that the goods taken were not of sentimental value as might be the case where they were stolen from residential premises. 
     
      
    12 She noted the plea of guilty and discounted the sentence by 25% for that plea, noting its utilitarian value and that it did demonstrate contrition. She said that apart from the plea it was difficult to find him truly remorseful and contrite, and she referred to the opinion of the Probation Service that any regret expressed by him appeared to be limited to the impact his offending behaviour had upon himself and his family rather than the victim of the offence and the community at large. 
     
      
    13 Her Honour thought that his prospects for rehabilitation remained extremely guarded. She said it would only be when he fully committed to residential rehabilitation and counselling to address the issues which arose from his childhood and led to his life of drugs and crime, and that it was only when he refrained from mixing with negative peers, that the community and his family could hope that his prospects would be enhanced. She noted that he acknowledged he was unable to reform on his own and that he needed help. Her Honour said only a sentence of full-time custody would satisfy the requirements of general and indeed specific deterrence.  
     
      
    14 She assessed the offence at falling below the mid range of objective seriousness. She said that a sentence of 3 years or less would not adequately punish him having regard to the objective seriousness of the offence committed and the circumstances of aggravation to which she had referred.  
     
      
    15 The Applicant seeks leave to appeal on 3 grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) The Sentencing Judge failed to adequately take into account totality. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Sentencing Judge failed to sufficiently take into account the steps towards rehabilitation whilst in custody. 
        
       
       
      (3) The sentence is manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      (1) Failing to take into account adequately the principle of totality 
       
      
    16 The Applicant submits that it was incumbent on the Sentencing Judge to consider the totality principle when passing sentence. The Applicant had effectively been in continuous custody from 22 December 2007 with the exception of the period 21-26 June 2008 being the period from his release on parole and his arrest for the offences under consideration. It was submitted that at the time the Applicant came to be sentenced he had already served a significant period in custody for offences closely related in time and character to the current offence. 
     
      
    17 As the Applicant acknowledges, the Sentencing Judge was aware that the Applicant had only just been released from custody at the time of the arrest for this offence. She twice referred to it, the second time in connection with his rehabilitation and the course that he had undertaken at Wellington Correction Centre.  
     
      
    18 It seems reasonably clear, however, that her Honour did not take into account that prior sentence when she came to sentence the Applicant. If that sentence and the sentence given for the offence under consideration are accumulated the Applicant would have received an overall sentence of 4 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months. The non-parole period would therefore have been slightly more than 78% of the total sentence. In the light of s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and the absence of any comment about that ratio from her Honour it seems likely that she did not have any regard to the prior sentence.  
     
      
    19 The totality principle applies in the present circumstances so that the earlier sentence ought to have been taken into account: Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 308; R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381 at [15].  
     
      
    20 Nevertheless, taking into account the sentence imposed on the Applicant on 8 January 2008 which resulted in his incarceration from 21 December 2007 to 21 June 2008 the overall sentence of 4 years and 3 months with a non-parole period of 3 years and 4 months is not an excessive sentence for all of the offences and neither the overall length of the sentence nor the effective non-parole period warranted this Court’s interference to reduce the ratio of the non-parole period with the total term.  
     
      
       
      (2) Failing to take into account sufficiently rehabilitation  
       
      
    21 Her Honour made a number of references about the Applicant’s prospects for rehabilitation. She noted that she had been asked to extend him leniency to enable him to demonstrate an ability to commit to rehabilitation to turn his life around. In that regard she noted what he had achieved at Wellington Correction Centre. She found, however, that his prospects for rehabilitation remained extremely guarded. She held that it would only be when he fully committed to residential rehabilitation and counselling that there could be any hope that his prospects would be enhanced. She noted his acknowledgment that he was unable to reform on his own and that he needed help.  
     
      
    22 It is not made clear how this matter should have played out in terms of the sentence the Applicant was given. It seems to have been suggested to the Judge by the Applicant’s counsel that the Applicant be given a short further period of custody with a period of total term of around 3 years with it being made a condition of his parole that he be released into residential rehabilitation.  
     
      
    23 It seems difficult to suggest that a sentence of 3 years and 9 months was outside the reasonable discretion of the Court particularly when a period of 3 years had been suggested on behalf of the Applicant. Although her Honour does not expressly refer to s 44(2) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 she obviously had it in mind because of the very precise period of non-parole that she directed. For the non-parole period to have been reduced her Honour would have had to have decided that there were special circumstances for its being less. The only possibility on all of the evidence was the rehabilitation of the Applicant and a consideration of a residential rehabilitation course.  
     
      
    24 However, the only glimmer of hope in relation to rehabilitation was the completion of the course at Wellington Correction Centre. Against that was the Judge’s finding that his prospects for rehabilitation remained extremely guarded, and his extensive criminal history which, on any view, warranted more than a short non-parole period in the circumstances. 
     
      
    25 It is not shown that her Honour failed to take into account sufficiently or at all his steps towards rehabilitation whilst in custody.  
     
      
      (3) The sentence is manifestly excessive 
       
      
    26 The Applicant points to 2 matters in suggesting that the sentence is manifestly excessive. First, the premises were commercial premises and the property taken had no sentimental value. Secondly, when the previous custodial sentence (served from 22 December 2007 to 21 June 2008) was considered together with the sentence imposed by her Honour, the total sentence was excessive. 
     
      
    27 This matter has effectively been answered when considering the totality principle under Ground 1. The Applicant had an extensive criminal history, the offence concerned was committed whilst the Applicant was on conditional liberty, the offence showed a measure of professional planning, organisation and execution, damage was done to various items of property and the value of the goods stolen was not insignificant. These were all matters that were identified as factors which enhanced the seriousness of the offence in R v Ponfield (1999) 48 NSWLR 327 at [48].  
     
      
    28 In R v Clifford [2008] NSWCCA 190 Price J said at [65]: 
     
      
       
        
        “This Court in  
        R v Harris 
         (2007) 171 A Crim R 267 emphasised that heavy sentences should generally be imposed for break, enter and steal offences committed by repeat offenders on domestic premises, whether or not they were aggravated forms of the offence. To my mind, there is no good reason why what was said in  
        Harris 
         should not apply to repeat offenders who break into business premises.” 
        
       
      
    29 It cannot be said that a notional starting point of 5 years with a full 25% discount for a guilty plea was a manifestly excessive sentence in all the circumstances. There was no error in her Honour not finding special circumstances to reduce the non-parole period. This ground fails. 
     
      
      Conclusion 
       
      
    30 In my opinion, leave should be granted but the appeal should be dismissed.

     DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC PROSECUTIONS (NSW) v MORADIAN, SALIBA and SPAROS 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JUDGMENT of THE COURT delivered by BASTEN JA: In this matter each of the respondents is a person against whom committal proceedings have commenced in the Local Court in respect of charges relating to the supply of a large commercial quantity of cocaine and dealing with the proceeds of crime. (The details of the charges are not presently relevant.) On 30 November 2009 the Director of Public Prosecutions applied for an order under s 5B of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 (NSW) permitting certain witnesses to give evidence by audio visual link from a place outside the court room. His Honour declined to make the order and the Director brought an appeal to this Court pursuant to s 5F(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). 
     
      
    2 In written submissions dated 9 December 2009 the Director set out in some detail the perceived inadequacies of the reasons given by the Magistrate for refusing the order. On 14 December each of the respondents filed separate submissions resisting the appeal, including on the ground that it was incompetent. None of the issues in dispute now arise for determination. When the matter came before this Court on 15 December 2009, the Director indicated that he did not seek to pursue the appeal and would revisit the matter in the Local Court on the basis of further evidence: Tcpt, p 1 (27). 
     
      
    3 When that position was announced, counsel for the three respondents each made an application for a certificate under the Suitors’ Fund Act 1951 (NSW). (It was conceded that there was no other basis for them to recover costs from the State, no certificate being available under the Costs in Criminal Cases Act 1967 (NSW) where the matter had not proceeded to an acquittal or discharge of a defendant, in accordance with s 2.) Otherwise, there is a prohibition on any order for the payment of the costs of an appeal: Criminal Appeal Act, s 17. 
     
      
    4 The primary provision in the Suitors’ Fund Act reads: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        6 Costs of certain appeals 
         
          
          (1) If an appeal against the decision of a court:  
           
            
            (a) to the Supreme Court on a question of law or fact … 
             
            succeeds, the Supreme Court may, on application, grant to the respondent to the appeal or to any one or more of several respondents to the appeal an indemnity certificate in respect of the appeal.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    5 There is no reason to suppose that the Director’s appeal pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act was not “an appeal” for the purposes of this provision. Nor would it cease to be an appeal if it were incompetent. 
     
      
    6 The next question is whether the appeal is taken “to the Supreme Court” where the appeal can only be brought, and has been brought, to the Court of Criminal Appeal. Section 3 of the Criminal Appeal Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        3 Constitution of court 
         
          
          (1) The Supreme Court shall for the purposes of this Act be the Court of Criminal Appeal, and the court shall be constituted by such three or more judges of the Supreme Court as the Chief Justice may direct.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      On one view, the effect of this provision is to constitute a separate Court of Criminal Appeal, distinct from the Supreme Court. However, at least for the purposes of s 73(ii) of the Constitution, it has been held that this Court is the Supreme Court of New South Wales. In  
      Stewart v The King  
      [1921] HCA 17; 29 CLR 234 at 240, the High Court held that s 3 of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
       “does not create or constitute a new Court distinct from the Supreme Court, but merely directs that the Supreme Court shall act as the Court of Criminal Appeal”. 
       
      
    7 It does not follow that a reference in a State statute to “the Supreme Court” will necessarily include the Court of Criminal Appeal; the context may indicate otherwise. If, for example, it were clear that s 6 of the Suitors’ Fund Act dealt only with civil appeals, the operation of the Act would be limited to that extent. Section 6 is not expressly so limited. Subsection 6(2)(a) primarily provides for payment of an amount equal to the appellant’s costs of the appeal ordered to be paid by the respondent, a circumstance which cannot arise in relation to a criminal appeal in this Court. However, paragraph (b) permits the payment of the respondent’s costs of the appeal whether or not an amount is payable under paragraph (a). On the other hand, s 6A dealing with aborted trials and retrials, is expressly applicable in relation to both civil and criminal proceedings. 
     
      
    8 For completeness it is convenient to note the terms of s 6C, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        6C Payments not otherwise authorised by this Act 
         
          
          (1) If:  
           
            
            (a) a party to an appeal or other proceedings incurs or is liable to pay costs in the appeal or proceedings, 
             
            (b) the party is not otherwise entitled to a payment from the Fund in respect of the costs, and 
             
            (c) the Director-General is of the opinion that a payment from the Fund in respect of the costs, although not authorised by section 6, 6A or 6B, would be within the spirit and intent of those sections, 
             
            the Director-General may, with the concurrence of the Attorney General, pay from the Fund to the party such amount towards the costs as is assessed by the Director-General having regard to the circumstances of the case. 
            
           
          (2) A payment under this section shall not exceed $10,000.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    9 No question arises in the present case as to the operation of s 6C. It permits the exercise of a discretionary power by the Director-General, but is not based upon and indeed assumes the absence of, a certificate granted by the Court under s 6, or another relevant provision. As has been said on a number of occasions, this Court has no role in respect of any possible application to the Director-General under this provision: see R v Pack [1999] NSWCCA 316 at [9]-[10]; R v Lilley [2000] NSWCCA 57; 111 A Crim R 468 at [35]-[37]; R v Gilfillan [2003] NSWCCA 102; 139 A Crim R 460 at [91]. 
     
      
    10 A certificate was granted under s 6 of the Suitors’ Fund Act by this Court in an appeal under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act in R v King [2003] NSWCCA 399; 59 NSWLR 472 at [98]-[105] (Spigelman CJ, Dunford J, Adams J agreeing). Section 6 has been applied in other decisions of this Court, including R v Hookham (No 2) (1993) 32 NSWLR 345 (Priestley JA, Wood and Sully JJ). 
     
      
    11 The problem facing the respondents, however, is that s 6 only applies where an appeal “succeeds”. Where that occurs, the purpose of the statute is to relieve the unsuccessful respondent of at least part of the costs for which he or she will be liable in circumstances where the court system, run by the State, has erred. If the appeal is unsuccessful, at least in civil cases, the respondent will be likely to obtain an order for the payment of his or her costs by the appellant. In criminal cases no such entitlement arises. The expense incurred by the successful respondent is not caused by a failure of the court system, but by the erroneous attempt by the appellant, in this case the Director acting on behalf of the State, to overturn the decision of the Court below. The arguable injustice arises from the lack of any statutory entitlement for the respondents to recoup their costs from the Director. 
     
      
    12 When in the course of argument it was pointed out that the appeal did not succeed, it having been withdrawn and, in due course dismissed, counsel merely stated that that was “sufficient for our purpose, otherwise no person who is the subject of a withdrawal would ever be able to get any form of recompense at all”: Tcpt, 15/12/09, p 4 (7). That may be so, but it provided no basis for the proposition that s 6 of the Suitors’ Fund Act was engaged in those circumstances. The appeal did not succeed and accordingly the application under the Suitors’ Fund Act must be dismissed.

His Honour Judge Bennett SC imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 2 years 6 months. 4 The appeal is concerned only with the conviction. Two grounds are relied upon. In essence they assert a failure by the trial judge to give directions (that he was not asked to give) in relation to certain things said by the appellant to investigating police officers prior to his arrest. It is contended that the jury should have been directed in accordance with Edwards v The Queen [1993] HCA 63; (1993) 178 CLR 193 about the care with which they should approach the issue of consciousness of guilt reasoning.The evidence at trial5 There was no dispute that a security guard was robbed as he left a McDonalds restaurant at Enfield with the takings of approximately $28,000 shortly before 11.00am on 9 October 2006. The appellant was employed at this store as a manager. He was rostered to work on the day of the robbery with his shift commencing at 11.30am.6 The day of the robbery was the first occasion the guard had attended this store. He was not wearing a uniform and there were no markings on his red utility that indicated his occupation. He took possession of the takings, left the store and returned to his utility. A motor cycle arrived quickly and stopped behind the utility. A male pillion passenger alighted. This man approached the driver’s door and pointed a gun directly at the guard and demanded the takings. The guard complied. The man returned to the motor cycle which was ridden quickly away. The guard re-entered the store and contact was made with his employer and with the police. 7 The robber was later identified as Mr Abdul Baghdadi. He was arrested on 12 October 2006.8 There was no dispute at the appellant’s trial that Baghdadi had received directions by telephone from Mr Said Yatim as to the identity of the security guard and the description of his vehicle. Yatim was the father of a part time employee at the store. There was no suggestion that he knew who the security guard was at any time prior to the robbery. Rather, it was not disputed that he had received that information from somebody else some time after the guard had arrived at the store and before the robbery, and that he relayed this information to Baghdadi. Yatim was arrested on 29 November 2006. At a later stage he agreed to give evidence against the appellant.9 The Crown case was that it was the appellant who had passed the information concerning the identity of the security guard and his vehicle to Yatim in order for him to relay it to the robber. A significant issue at the trial was whether the appellant was in the company of Yatim in the vicinity of the store at the time of the robbery. Yatim said that he was and that he was the source of the information that had been relayed to Baghdadi.10 The Crown did not rely exclusively upon the evidence of Yatim. Indeed, the Crown Prosecutor sought to make a case largely based upon inferences arising from other evidence, describing the prosecution case as circumstantial and referring to Yatim’s evidence as confirming the conclusions that could otherwise be drawn. It would seem that the Crown Prosecutor was conscious of the possibility that the jury may be doubtful about Yatim’s credibility. The other evidence included the product of telephone intercepts. Baghdadi’s telephone was being intercepted in the course of an unrelated investigation. There was also CCTV footage from the store that assisted in fixing the times that certain events occurred. There was some inaccuracy in the times recorded in the telephone intercept and CCTV material but there was evidence which permitted corrections to be made. Counsel for the appellant submitted to the jury that they should be doubtful about the accuracy of the times but the jury obviously accepted the correctness of the times of at least the material events. Where I refer below to times it is with recourse to the corrected time.11 Yatim gave evidence to the effect that he was desperate for money because of pressure being placed upon him by Baghdadi to repay $1,000. He told the appellant about this and offered to sell the appellant his car. The appellant responded by offering him “a job”. He related how security officers attended the McDonalds store each Monday and Thursday to collect the takings and suggested that Yatim could commit a robbery. Yatim responded that he was too afraid to do such a thing. Later, Yatim was contacted by Baghdadi who made a further demand for repayment of the debt. Yatim told him of the McDonalds robbery proposal. Baghdadi expressed interest. Yatim told him that the plan originated with a manager.12 The following day Yatim spoke again with the appellant. He asked how the security guards could be identified and the appellant said that he would point them out to him. Yatim told him that he was not going to do the job himself but some younger men or boys would do it.13 On the day of the robbery both Yatim and Baghdadi went separately to the store. Yatim inquired of staff as to the whereabouts of the appellant and was told that he had not yet arrived. Yatim waited in his car. A number of telephone conversations with Baghdadi ensued in which there was reference to Yatim waiting for the arrival of his “man”. 14 Yatim said that he eventually observed the appellant smoking a cigarette outside the store and he approached and spoke to him. He asked the appellant what was happening. The appellant told him that there was a sole security guard, he was a new one, and that he was inside obtaining the takings. Yatim also claimed that the appellant also said, “This is the car he drives, it’s a red ute”. Defence counsel invited the jury to consider how the appellant could have known this, given that he arrived after the guard had entered the store. In any event, Yatim said that he then suggested that the appellant come with him to stand next to Yatim’s car to make it appear as if they were having a look at it. Later in his evidence, he claimed that it was the appellant who had suggested they go and talk near Yatim’s car because there was a security camera near the entrance to the store.15 Yatim said that there was a telephone conversation with Baghdadi in which he told Baghdadi that his “man” was standing right next to him and would tell him when the guard emerged from the store. Yatim claimed that he was still on the phone talking to Baghdadi when the appellant indicated to him that the guard was leaving the store. Yatim relayed this to Baghdadi. He then gave evidence of observing Baghdadi commit the robbery. After the motor cycle was ridden away the appellant said, “Come, let’s go around the block in the car, if they ask us we will say we were trying the car”. 16 Yatim’s evidence was that Baghdadi reneged on an understanding that the proceeds of the robbery would be shared. He claimed that he received nothing. A week later he spoke with the appellant who told him, “I don’t want anything but let no-one talk and mention my name”.17 Yatim’s evidence was disputed and heavily criticised by counsel for the appellant. He agreed that he had a previous conviction for fraud. He also agreed that he had received a discount on his sentence and that the sentencing judge had told him that the discount could be removed if he changed his mind about giving evidence for the prosecution. He denied a proposition that he was lying about the involvement of the appellant in the robbery.18 The evidence independent of Yatim was to the following effect. The security guard arrived at the store at 10.40.37. He parked his red utility near the entrance and walked inside. He returned almost immediately to the utility to retrieve his identification. He re-entered the store at 10.41.00. The appellant arrived and entered the store at 10.43.17. At this time the guard was in the office of the store. The appellant conceded in his evidence that he saw this person in the office and realised that he must have been the security guard because nobody else would have any business being in the office at that time. The appellant left the store at 10.46.00 and commenced to smoke a cigarette immediately outside. He said that Yatim approached him at this point and a very short time later the two went over to where Yatim’s car was parked. The appellant claimed that this was for the purpose of him having a look at the car in order to decide whether he was interested in buying it.19 An intercepted telephone conversation between Yatim and Baghdadi which commenced at 10.47.59 included Yatim saying, “this car over there, the red one ... yes, a ute, listen ... a red car, a ute, an old man alone, carrying the bag”. The guard left the restaurant at 10.48.26. At 10.48.27 Yatim rang Baghdadi and said, in part, “Hurry up ... he is out, the man is out! Is that him? Is that him?” The translator from Arabic to English of the intercepted telephone calls gave evidence that the words “Is that him? Is that him?” were spoken by Yatim. Yatim gave evidence that he had directed this repeated question to the appellant who was standing nearby.20 Baghdadi was then recorded as saying, “Go, go, go, go” which was followed by the sound of a motor cycle engine revving. Baghdadi then asked Yatim where “he” was and Yatim replied, “Here he is in the red ute, here he is, he is standing in the shop’s door”. Baghdadi was recorded then giving directions, apparently to the motor cycle rider, to pull up next to the utility. 21 The security guard made a telephone call to his employer to report the robbery at 10.50.00. At 10.50.16 he walked back into the store. At 10.54.34 the store manager called the security company office. At 11.00.07 the manager made a call to triple 0. Police officers arrived at the store at 11.08.45.22 The evidence I have summarised thus far was sufficient for the jury to conclude that the robbery occurred at around 10.49 am. It was also sufficient for the jury to conclude that Yatim relayed to Baghdadi information he received from somebody at around that time in order that the robbery of the guard could be committed. It was a matter for the jury whether they accepted the evidence of Yatim that this somebody was the appellant. The appellant’s evidence in conjunction with the corrected times of the events I have referred to strongly supported the proposition that the appellant was in the company of Yatim at the time of the robbery. Indeed, that conclusion was available even if Yatim’s evidence was disregarded.23 I have mentioned that Baghdadi was arrested on 12 October 2006 and Yatim was arrested on 29 November 2006. On 18 December 2006 police attended the Enfield McDonalds in order to retrieve some CCTV material and whilst they were there they spoke with the appellant. According to the police officers the following conversation ensued: 
     
      
       
        
        Det Bourke: We’re still investigating the robbery, are you aware that a number of people have been arrested for the robbery? 
         
        Appellant: Yeah, one of the staff member’s fathers was arrested. [I interpolate that this was clearly a reference to Yatim] 
         
         
        Det Bourke: Yeah that’s right, do you know him? 
         
        Appellant: Yeah I’ve met him, I know him just to say hello to. 
         
         
        Det Mooney: What time did you work on the day of the robbery? 
         
        Appellant: I was rostered to start at 11.30 but  
        I got here about 11 or quarter past 11 
        . 
         
         
        Det Mooney: So did you arrive after the robbery? 
         
        Appellant: Yeah. 
         
         
        Det Bourke: When was the last time you saw Fatima’s father? [Again, a reference to Yatim] 
         
        Appellant: On the day. 
         
         
        Det Bourke: What day? 
         
        Appellant: The day that it happened, he wanted to sell me a car. 
         
         
        Det Mooney: What happened? 
         
        Appellant: I got to work and was having a smoke outside with a staff member when he asked me whether I wanted to buy a car. 
         
         
        Det Mooney: Was this before or after the robbery? 
         
        Appellant:  
        I got here after it happened 
        . (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    24 The appellant described sitting at the first table outside the store when he was having his cigarette. He said there was no-one with Yatim when they went to have a look at the car. He indicated where Yatim’s car had been parked a short distance away from the store. After some further conversation there was this: 
     
      
       
        
        Det Bourke: Have you seen him since then? 
         
        Appellant: No 
         
         
        Det Bourke: Do you know his name? 
         
        Appellant:  
        No I don’t even know his phone number. I’ve never spoken with him on the phone before 
        . (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    25 The detectives’ evidence was that no contemporaneous record was made of this conversation but that Detective Bourke recorded it in his official notebook some 45 minutes later after having viewed CCTV footage which indicated that the appellant had in fact arrived at the store before the robbery.26 On 20 December 2006 the appellant voluntarily attended a police station where an electronically recorded interview took place. The detectives first sought to have the appellant adopt the record of the conversation that took place two days earlier. He agreed with the record of the conversation up until the point where the police claimed that he had said, “I got here after it happened”. He claimed that he had said that he arrived before the robbery. He agreed with the record of the conversation that then followed up until the point where the police claimed that he had said that he had not seen Yatim since the robbery. He asserted that he had told them that he saw him a week or a couple of weeks after. He agreed with the accuracy of the record in respect of the very next question and answer as to not having spoken with Yatim on the telephone. He did not at that point (like he did at the trial) raise any issue about a question asked by the police that they had omitted in the record.27 The appellant then provided his version of what he did on the day of the robbery. He said that after having arrived at the store he went inside, said hello to some staff members and put his keys and phone away in the office. Whilst he was there he noticed the presence of the security guard. He then went outside, sat down and had a cigarette. He was approached by Yatim. He did not know his name, only that he was the father of one of the members of staff. (At a later point in the interview he said that he knew the staff member’s surname was Yatim). Yatim asked if he was still interested in buying Yatim’s car. He had first been approached by Yatim one or two weeks earlier and asked if he was interested in buying the car. He replied that he was but could not look at it at that time because he was in the process of closing the store. On this occasion, however, he agreed to go and have a look at it. They went to the car and took it for a drive around the block. When they returned he heard from the store manager that there had been a robbery. He did not buy the car because he said Yatim was asking too much for it.28 The appellant agreed that the location where Yatim’s car had been parked afforded a clear view of the entrance to the store. He also said that he was aware that security guards pick up the takings on Mondays and Thursdays.29 The appellant said that he had smoked “pretty much all of” his cigarette before Yatim approached him outside the store. He then spent “a good 5 minutes” looking at the car before getting into it. He said that Yatim was standing nearby, maybe two metres away, while he was inspecting the engine, the interior and the exterior of the car. He was unaware of Yatim using a mobile phone in this time. He said the test drive took around 10 minutes. At no time did he see Yatim with anyone else. There was no-one in the vicinity of the car when they walked over to it.30 The appellant was shown the CCTV footage from the store. He identified himself leaving the store and estimated that this was “a couple of minutes” before the security guard walked out of the store. He denied that he had given information to Yatim about the security guard.31 During the course of the interview the appellant drew a sketch and made marks on some photographs. In doing so he indicated that the table where he claimed he was smoking a cigarette was directly outside the entrance to the store and that the car space occupied by the security guard’s utility was 3 or 4 car spaces away. 32 At the conclusion of the interview the appellant was released without charge. He was arrested on 11 April 2007. There was a further electronically recorded interview. He said that what he had said in the interview of 20 December 2006 was “pretty much” correct. He added, “Like, yeah, like things I could have said could be wrong and right but ... It was a while back ... So I can’t say whether it’s all 100 per cent”. He said that he did not want to add or withdraw anything that he had said in the previous interview and did not wish to be further interviewed. 33 The appellant gave evidence. He clarified that in the interview of 20 December 2006 he had made a correction as to when he arrived at the store in relation to the robbery. This was because at first he had told the police when he had arrived at the store after the drive in Mr Yatim’s car. He had later realised that the police were talking about when he had first arrived at the store.34 He told the police that he had smoked “pretty much all” of his cigarette after walking out of the store and before being approached by Mr Yatim and by that he meant that it had taken four to five minutes. Later he said that it would have been “a good 3 minutes, 4 minutes” before Yatim came up to him. He spoke to Yatim for “not even a minute” whilst at that location. They walked over to Yatim’s car. He spent “a good 5 minutes” looking at the car. The test drive took “approximately 10 (minutes), it could be less”. He arrived back at the store before the arrival of the police.35 The appellant denied various critical components of the evidence given by Yatim. He said he was not aware of Yatim using a phone at any stage, although in cross-examination he accepted that he might have been with him in the vicinity of Yatim’s car at the time of the calls to Baghdadi. He confirmed that his conversation with Yatim on the day of the robbery was in connection with Yatim trying to sell his car. There was no-one else present when he was with Yatim at Yatim’s car. He was unaware of a robbery occurring until he walked back into the store after the drive in Yatim’s car and was told about it by one of the staff. The staff member with whom he said he had been sitting having his cigarette outside the store had given evidence of hearing the squeal of brakes and seeing a motorcycle near the entrance to the store but the appellant did not hear or see these things.36 In relation to that part of the conversation with the police on 18 December 2006 when the appellant had said, “No I don’t even know his phone number. I’ve never spoken with him on the phone before”, the appellant said in cross examination that there was a question asked by police that they had omitted from their evidence that had prompted that response. He claimed that he had been asked, “Have you had any other contact with Mr Yatim by phone or any other way apart from him dropping his daughter off?”. 37 There was evidence before the jury that the appellant had no previous criminal convictions. He called a witness who attested to his good character. Some of the prosecution witnesses had said similar things when cross-examined by the appellant’s counsel.Grounds of appeal38 Two grounds of appeal were set out in the notice of appeal: 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1 The trial judge erred in his directions regarding the alleged lie of the appellant on 18 December 2006 as to when he first arrived at the McDonalds on 9 October 2006 
         
         
        Ground 2 The trial judge erred in his directions regarding the appellant’s alleged unprompted denial on 18 December 2006 of any telephone contact with Said Yatim 
        
       
      
    39 The first ground of appeal was abandoned after the appellant’s representatives received the Crown’s written submissions, it being conceded that the submissions were, in respect of that ground, “for the most part, persuasive”. It was at that stage that a third ground was added with leave that was granted at the hearing of the appeal. 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 3 The trial judge erred in his directions regarding the statement of the appellant to the police on 20 December 2006 that he arrived at work before the robbery and spoke to “Fatima’s father” about a car 
        
       
      
    Ground 2 – Directions concerning “the unprompted denial”40 This ground is concerned with the evidence of an aspect of the conversation between police officers and the appellant on 18 December 2006 concerning his relationship with Yatim. It is set out earlier but for convenience repeated: 
     
      
       
        
        Det Bourke: Have you seen him since then? 
         
        Appellant: No 
         
         
        Det Bourke: Do you know his name? 
         
        Appellant:  
        No I don’t even know his phone number. I’ve never spoken with him on the phone before 
        . (Emphasis added). 
        
       
      
    41 I also mentioned earlier that the appellant gave evidence to the effect that the police had asked a question that prompted this response – “Have you had any other contact with Mr Yatim by phone or any other way apart from him dropping his daughter off?”42 The Crown Prosecutor cross-examined the appellant about this response. It was suggested to him that he was trying to make clear that he had never had any telephone contact with Yatim; that he was very careful not to have any telephone contact with him because he was involved in the planning of a robbery with him; that he wanted to stress to the police that he had not had telephone contact for that reason; and that it was an “odd response”. The appellant disagreed with each of these propositions.43 In his closing address the prosecutor described the Crown case as being a circumstantial one (despite the direct evidence of Yatim). He then made submissions concerning each of the “circumstances”. In the course of this he referred to the part of the conversation with the police of 18 December 2006 in which the appellant had told the officers that he had arrived after the robbery. He submitted to the jury that this was a lie which was relevant to the appellant’s knowledge that he had committed the crime and argued that it was one of the “circumstances”.44 After completing his review of that part of the 18 December 2006 conversation with the police the prosecutor then said: 
     
      
       
        
        Also in this conversation you get the reference, “Do you know his name?” asked the police officer, the accused says, “No”. But then he says something else, “I don’t even know his phone number, I’ve never spoken with him on the phone”. The prosecution says that is a very odd response for him to provide on this occasion to a question, “Do you know his name?” He’s somebody at that point in time who was trying to provide to the police a suggestion that well, he doesn’t have telephone contact with this man, in other words, he said too much at that point in time. (T21.10.09 at 13.15). 
        
       
      
    45 The prosecutor then continued, “Ladies and gentlemen, the other circumstance the prosecution would ask you to take into account is ...”, and he then discussed the evidence of the telephone intercept in which Yatim had said, allegedly to somebody in his immediate presence, “Is that him, is that him?”46 Whilst this ground is phrased in terms of an error in directions, the real complaint is one of an absence of a direction. It was articulated in written submissions as being that “the trial judge failed to give a proper direction to the jury as to how they should approach the evidence in the event that they were satisfied of the accuracy of the police version of what was said”. The judge had referred to the evidence in the course of his summing up when dealing with disputed police evidence. In that context he had referred to the Crown contention that the appellant “might have been attempting to distance himself from Yatim” and “was perhaps rather too ready to offer information which would support that proposition”. It was submitted, however, that the trial judge should have given directions about the “care” which the jury should exercise before using the evidence against the appellant. 47 It was submitted on behalf of the appellant that the Crown had relied upon this response as part of the circumstantial case against him. It was acknowledged that the Crown was not relying upon it as a lie told out of consciousness of guilt. Indeed, the Crown did not suggest that it was a lie. The Crown accepted that there had been no telephone contact between the appellant and Yatim. It was submitted that “there was every risk that the jury would use the evidence as part of the case against the appellant without proper directions as to the care with which they should approach the evidence”. It was contended that the jury would have understood that the Crown relied upon the evidence to support an inference of consciousness of guilt and that an Edwards type direction should have been given (see Edwards v The Queen (supra). Alternatively it was submitted, with reliance upon Edwards and Dhanhoa v The Queen [2003] HCA 40; (2003) 217 CLR 1, that even if the Crown was not relying upon this evidence to support an inference of consciousness of guilt, such reasoning may have been adopted by the jury in any event and so it was incumbent upon the trial judge to give an Edwards direction.48 Mr Odgers SC, counsel for the appellant in this court but not at trial, amplified this submission by contending that the jury should have been told that they should consider alternative explanations for the appellant’s “unprompted denial”. He suggested by way of example that it was not odd for the appellant to have said what he said when he was speaking with the police about discussions that he claimed that he had with Yatim about the possible purchase of his car. Another suggestion was that the appellant was an innocent man trying to distance himself from a man he thought was guilty.49 It was submitted that the “complete absence of directions to the jury about the way in which they should approach this evidence created a real danger of a miscarriage of justice” because the jury might have used it to “remove doubts that arose from the evidence of Yatim and the inability of the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt (absent reliance on this evidence) that the appellant was with Yatim at the time of the robbery”. 50 No objection concerning the absence of a direction was made by experienced counsel who appeared at the trial and so Rule 4 Criminal Appeal Rules applies. Enough has been said, and frequently, in recent years about the approach that should be taken in respect of Rule 4 that there is no need for me to review the jurisprudence in any detail. A useful collection of relevant authority can be found in the recent judgment of Campbell JA in Sanchez v R [2009] NSWCCA 171 at [59] – [62]. 51 For the Crown it was submitted that the Crown Prosecutor at trial had relied upon the appellant’s unprompted denial for credibility purposes only. The reference to the topic in the Crown Prosecutor’s closing address (see [44] above) was simply a digression made by the prosecutor during the course of dealing with the circumstances upon which the Crown’s circumstantial evidence case was based. The prosecutor had just made submissions to the jury about the lie it alleged the appellant told in the conversation with the police on 18 December 2006 about when he arrived at the McDonalds store in relation to the robbery. After dealing with that part of the conversation he digressed to mention another aspect of it. It was referred to again later in the prosecutor’s closing address but at that stage in the course of a lengthy critique of the appellant’s credibility. In that context, the prosecutor pointed out that whilst the appellant had corrected the police in the recorded interview of 20 December 2006 about another matter when they were seeking to have him adopt their notebook record of the conversation two days earlier, he had said nothing about a failure by the police to record a question they had asked which had prompted his denial of having had telephone contact with Yatim.52 It was submitted that there was a contrast between the prosecutor’s treatment of the alleged lie concerning the time he arrived at the McDonalds store and his treatment of the unprompted denial which, at its highest, was referred to as a “very odd response”.53 On behalf of the appellant in reply it was accepted that in the latter part of the prosecutor’s closing address he had been addressing the topic of the appellant’s credibility. It was submitted that he was contending that the appellant’s attempt to explain the unprompted denial was not credible and that the police officers’ evidence should be accepted. Thus, it was submitted, the prosecutor was contending that the appellant had said something on 18 December 2006 that he needed to “explain away” because it was inculpatory. It was contended that the prosecutor had suggested how it was inculpatory in the earlier part of his closing address when he was dealing with the circumstances in the Crown’s circumstantial evidence case. Consideration54 I am not satisfied that the Crown was relying upon the “unprompted denial” as part of its circumstantial case against the appellant. Reading what the prosecutor said in his closing address in context leaves me with the distinct impression that he was simply digressing during the course of making submissions about the circumstances upon which the Crown relied, finding it convenient to mention the “unprompted denial” at a point when he had just referred to another aspect of the conversation of 18 December 2006. The trial judge appears to have understood the prosecutor in this way as well. When he referred to the list of circumstances relied upon by the Crown in its circumstantial evidence case he made no reference to this topic.55 The Crown Prosecutor, in stark contrast to the explicit submission he made about the before/after lie, did not suggest to the jury that the “unprompted denial” arose from a consciousness of guilt. He did not say so in direct terms and nor did he imply it. It is of considerable significance that defence counsel did not see it that way either. She meticulously addressed the various points raised in the prosecutor’s closing address but she did not, apparently, perceive any risk that what he had said about the “unprompted denial” would give rise to consciousness of guilt reasoning.56 I am also satisfied that what the trial judge said did not, on its own or in addition to what the prosecutor had said, suggest that the “unprompted denial” could give rise to consciousness of guilt reasoning. He specifically told the jury that the lie in relation to when the appellant arrived on the scene could be used for that purpose, subject to the cautionary directions he gave, but the fact that he did not refer to the “unprompted denial” as being open to the same type of reasoning further served to confine any consciousness of guilt reasoning to the lie.57 In response to a request by the Crown Prosecutor, the trial judge reinforced to the jury that the only “out of court representation” by the appellant that was relied upon by the Crown as a lie was the before/after lie.58 As to the submission that the trial judge should have counselled the jury to consider alternative explanations for why the appellant made the “unprompted denial” it is again of significance that trial counsel was obviously not concerned to suggest anything of this nature. Her sole submission to the jury was that they should accept the appellant’s evidence that the police had asked a question which prompted his denial.59 There remains the question of whether the jury of its own may have adopted consciousness of guilt reasoning despite no suggestion of it having been raised by either the prosecutor or the judge or perceived by the appellant’s counsel. Once again I am not satisfied that there was a risk of this. The evidence of the “unprompted denial” was such a peripheral part of the evidence in the prosecution case that it is very doubtful that the jury gave it much, if any, attention at all. As an illustration of how minor the point was, what the prosecutor said about it in his closing address occupies eight lines of the transcript whereas the entire address occupies something in the order of one thousand seven hundred lines of transcript. 60 Further, the line of reasoning that the appellant contends the jury may have engaged in would involve the drawing of an inference. The trial judge gave the jury a customary and adequate warning, about which no complaint is made, about the care with which they should approach the task of drawing inferences. He reiterated this direction a number of times and at one point he went so far as to say that the jury could only draw inferences adverse to the accused and in favour of the Crown: 
     
      
       
        
        (W)hen the inference can be drawn beyond reasonable doubt. That also involves of course the proposition that if there is any rational hypothesis or reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence then the accused should have the benefit of the doubt created by that inference. (SU 23.10.08 at 65). 
        
       
      
    61 Later, in response to a jury question after they had retired, the judge reiterated his directions in relation to the drawing of inferences, including repetition about the caution required. He referred to the Crown case being based upon circumstantial evidence, fleshed out by the evidence of Yatim, and in the course of this he also made specific reference to the before/after lie. Again, he said nothing about the “unprompted denial” as a circumstance upon which the Crown relied.62 This case at trial concerned many other aspects of the evidence which were of moment. The “unprompted denial” was a very minor and peripheral point. It would be completely unrealistic to elevate it to a matter of such importance that despite experienced defence counsel not perceiving it as a matter of the same substance for which it is now contended it had, and in the absence of directions for which appellate counsel now contends should have been given, there has been a miscarriage of justice. Leave to rely upon Ground 2 should be refused.Ground 3 – Directions concerning the appellant arriving before the robbery and speaking to Yatim about a car63 The essence of this ground is also a failure to direct rather than an error in directions. It is concerned with the following portion of the interview between the police officers and the appellant on 20 December 2006. The context in which it appears is that the officers were taking the appellant through their notes of the conversation they had with the appellant two days earlier, seeking to have him adopt the accuracy of that record.

    64 The police evidence was that two days earlier the appellant had told them that he had arrived after the robbery. The Crown relied upon that statement as a lie arising from a consciousness of guilt. The prosecutor dealt with the above passage from the recorded interview in the course of his closing address to the jury. The relevant passage of his address (extracted below) appears in the middle of a section in which the prosecutor was anticipating arguments that might be raised by defence counsel and was posing contrary arguments. He referred to the interviews on 18 and 20 December 2006 and anticipated an argument that the appellant was simply answering questions in a casual fashion without thinking that he was a suspect. It seems that the prosecutor anticipated that this might be a submission that would be made to explain the lie told at the first interview about arriving after the robbery. He endeavoured to counter such a submission by pointing out matters such as the formality of the interview and the fact that the appellant was informed of his rights. It was in this context that the following was said: 
     
      
       
        
        What has occurred is an attempt to play down his level of seriousness at this point in time. In my submission, that’s something that you just would reject. You see isn’t it the case that his admissions to police, his conversation to police actually show some changes, particularly in regard to when it is he said that he arrived. Changing it in the interview to before the robbery, in circumstances where he had to correct what he’d said to the police earlier on. You see, this is not the situation of an accused going along and just casually saying stuff to the police. What it was, was he was answering the police officer’s questions. They were close questioning and he did so in circumstances where you would accept that he was somebody that you would expect would be trying to provide accurate information.  
        In my submission what he effectively did at this time, in reality was to try and provide an alibi for Mr Yatim and in doing so, what he did was he inadvertently disclosed his own involvement in the offence 
        . (Emphasis added). (T23.45 on 21.10.08). 
        
       
      
    65 The prosecutor then proceeded to deal with other anticipated defence arguments on unrelated topics.66 In oral submissions Mr Odgers added reference to an earlier portion of the prosecutor’s closing address. The prosecutor was submitting that even on the assessment of times given by the appellant in his evidence he would have been in the presence of Yatim at the time of the robbery. In this context he said: 
     
      
       
        
        This is not a case, I suggest to you, ladies and gentlemen, that really is about time; what it is about is that this accused went on this day, spoke to the police on 20 December, what he did was to provide what he may thought was an alibi for Mr Yatim, but which in fact turned out to be something that implicated him in the crime, because he was somebody who knew he was with Mr Yatim at the time the crime was being committed. (T21.10.09 at 10.30). 
        
       
      
    67 Counsel for the appellant also drew attention to the two emphasised passages in the following extract from the cross-examination of the appellant: 
     
      
       
        
        Q. Was it the case sir that when you were speaking to the police officers in the interview you had had some time to think about the fact that Mr Yatim had been arrested and apparently charged by police in relation to the robbery, you agree with that? 
         
        A. Yeah, I knew he was charged with the robbery yeah. 
         
         
        Q.  
        And is it the case sir that you were somebody who wanted to provide an alibi for Mr Yatim 
        ? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. And was that part of an agreement that you had with Mr Yatim around about the time of the robbery ... 
         
        A. No it wasn’t. 
         
         
        Q. ... that you two would account for each others movements ... 
         
        A. No it wasn’t. 
         
         
        Q. ... by saying that you had been with each other? 
         
        A. No. 
         
         
        Q. Could that be the case, sir?  
         
        A. No it isn’t the case. 
         
         
        Q. And could it be the situation that what you didn’t bring into your mind was the fact that the police were lawfully recording the phone calls that were coming across to this man, Mr Baghdadi? 
         
        A. No, no, no that’s not right. 
         
         
        Q. And that created a problem for you, didn’t it sir? 
         
        A. No it didn’t because i – like I said. 
         
         
        Q. Because you didn’t have any involvement on the phone with Mr Yatim? 
         
        A. I didn’t have any involvement with Mr Yatim whatsoever apart from the car, from me looking at his car to buy it. 
         
         
        Q.  
        Is that why during the interview you went and told the police that you arrived before the robbery because at that stage you had realised that you needed to provide an alibi for Mr Yatim 
        ? 
         
        A. No. (Emphasis added). (T1080.41 – 1081.29). 
        
       
      
    68 Mr Odgers characterised the trial prosecutor’s argument as being that the appellant told the police on 20 December 2006 that he arrived before the robbery in an attempt to persuade them that Yatim was not involved in the robbery, the appellant being unaware that the police were in possession of telephone intercept material that established that Yatim was in fact involved. Thus it was submitted that the Crown had been relying upon the appellant “providing an alibi for Yatim” as evidence of consciousness of guilt. The essence of this ground of appeal is encapsulated in the submission that “the trial judge gave no directions at all to the jury as to how they should approach such a process of reasoning, that is, inferring consciousness of guilt from an admission by the appellant that he was present at work prior to the robbery and spoke to Yatim at some time thereafter”. It was submitted that the Crown was contending “that the jury should infer that the appellant attempted to help Mr Yatim because he ‘needed’ to do so in order to protect himself, so that the jury should have been directed they needed to be satisfied of this before they used the alleged lie as evidence of the appellant’s guilt”.69 Mr Odgers submitted that the direction the trial judge should have given to the jury should have included reference to the possibility that there could be an innocent explanation for the appellant “providing an alibi for Mr Yatim”. One, consistent with the defence case, was that the appellant arrived at the McDonalds store before the robbery but did not have any contact with Yatim until immediately after the robbery. Another was that the appellant believed Yatim to be innocent, notwithstanding that he had been charged by the police, and the appellant was trying to assist in establishing his innocence. Consideration70 The Crown Prosecutor did not submit to the jury that they should use this evidence as establishing a consciousness of guilt. Defence counsel in her address dealt with what the Crown Prosecutor had said in his address but it is not apparent that she perceived the issue as being one of consciousness of guilt. She simply submitted to the jury that the idea of the appellant providing an alibi for Yatim did not make sense. The trial judge did not direct the jury that it was a matter that could be used as establishing a consciousness of guilt. Defence counsel did not ask for any direction on the subject. 71 In any event, the Crown Prosecutor’s contention had no merit. What the appellant was doing in the interview of 20 December 2006 was simply correcting something that the police claimed that he had said two days earlier. He was saying that he arrived before the robbery. That was the fact. It was established by the CCTV footage. It was common ground at the trial. So too was it an undisputed fact that Yatim was present at the scene prior to, during, and immediately after the robbery. The appellant’s statement to the police that he (the appellant) arrived before the robbery did nothing to provide an “alibi” for Yatim. 72 In supplementary written submissions Mr Odgers provided the terms of a direction that he submitted the trial judge should have given. It includes: 
     
      
       
        
        In relation to the alleged false alibi for Yatim, you must be satisfied that the accused was suggesting that he was with Mr Yatim at the time of the robbery. 
        
       
      
    73 The suggested direction then continues with reference to the need for the jury to be satisfied that the conduct upon which the Crown relied occurred and also that the accused engaged in that conduct because of a realisation of his guilt. It continues with a direction that the jury should consider the possibility of other explanations for the conduct other than realisation of guilt, such as that the appellant was trying to help Yatim because he believed that he was innocent.74 There are two obvious problems with this suggested direction. No-one, including the trial prosecutor, suggested that by the appellant telling the police that he arrived at the store before the robbery he was suggesting that he was with Yatim at the time of the robbery. Further, at no stage did the appellant say that he believed that Yatim was innocent of the robbery and so it would have been quite inappropriate for the trial judge to suggest that this was an alternative explanation.75 The statement of this ground of appeal includes reference to the appellant speaking to “Fatima’s father” about a car. That is not only what the appellant told the police but it is also what he said in the course of his evidence. Indeed, the factual basis of his case at trial was in all material respects the same as the version he advanced in the police interview. I am not persuaded that what he said in the interview, and in his evidence, could be characterised as providing an alibi for Yatim. The defence case did not seek to establish that Yatim was not involved in the robbery because he had an alibi. His case was that Yatim approached him and discussed the possible sale of his car immediately after whatever Yatim had done in relation to the robbery.76 The fundamental premise of this ground is that the jury might have concluded that the trial prosecutor was correct in characterising the appellant’s claim in the interview of 20 December 2006 that he arrived before the robbery as an attempt to provide an alibi for Yatim and from that conclusion they may have use it as evidence giving rise to an inference of guilt. I am not persuaded that there is any possibility that the jury could have concluded that the appellant was attempting to provide an alibi for Yatim. Like the subject matter of ground 2, this point was minor and peripheral in the context of all of the other evidence in the trial. Many other matters received far greater attention in the evidence, the addresses and the summing up. It is doubtful, in my view, that the jury would have given this evidence any attention at all beyond confirming that what the appellant had originally said about arriving after the robbery was a lie. 77 Leave to rely upon Ground 3 should be refusedOther authorities relied upon by the appellant78 Before departing the matter it is appropriate to refer to some further authorities relied upon by counsel for the appellant. Mr Odgers sought to liken what occurred in this trial to situations that have arisen in other cases in which it has been held that the trial judge should have directed the jury in relation to consciousness of guilt reasoning and that as a result there had been a miscarriage of justice. Each of these cases are distinguishable for the reasons I will indicate.79 In Regina v Smit & Ors [2004] NSWCCA 409 a witness gave evidence that one of the accused had approached him and asked him to provide her with a false alibi. The prosecutor’s closing address posed the questions “Why would she ask him that?” and “Is it that she is trying to distance herself from this scene?”. The trial judge summarised the various matters relied upon by the Crown, one of them being, “(E)vidence from Mr Ranse that she sought to set up with him a false story of staying at his place”. Whilst the term “consciousness of guilt” was not used, it was held that what had been said conveyed an invitation to the jury to use the evidence in that way. As a result it was held: 
     
      
       
        
        It was incumbent upon his Honour to give a full direction as to how the jury could use this evidence to inculpate Ms Tarrant along the lines analogous to that which is required when a prosecution relies upon the telling of lies as evidencing such a consciousness:  
        Edwards v The Queen 
         (1993) 178 CLR 193. 
        
       
      
    80 In that case the prosecutor’s argument clearly raised an issue of consciousness of guilt reasoning arising from the evidence that the accused had sought to create a false alibi. In the present case nothing said by the prosecutor or the judge raised such an issue in relation to either the subject matters of grounds 2 and 3 and I am satisfied that there was nothing inherent in the evidence that gave rise to the possibility of the jury adopting such reasoning.81 The Queen v MC; DPP v MC [2009] VSCA 122 concerned an appeal against conviction for sexual assault offences. The prosecution alleged that whilst at a bar the complainant’s drink had been spiked and that the applicant had subsequently taken advantage of her drug affected state by having sexual intercourse with her without her consent. The prosecutor submitted to the jury that the applicant and a witness had concocted evidence that the applicant and the complainant had been involved in passionate kissing. It was also submitted that the applicant had told lies in relation to other matters in a police interview. The prosecutor did not use the term “consciousness of guilt”. The prosecutor submitted to the jury that the asserted lies told in the police interview went only to his credit. The trial judge did not give any direction in accordance with either Edwards v The Queen or Zoneff v The Queen [2000] HCA 28; (2000) 200 CLR 234. It was held (at [42]) that the alleged concoction was being put as a consciousness of guilt arising from a combination of post offence conduct and a lie and it was also held (at [61]) that it was inevitable that the jury, without proper direction, might readily conclude that the lies in the police interview were told out of consciousness of guilt. Ultimately it was held (at [65] – [66]) that a Zoneff direction would not have sufficed and that an Edwards direction should have been given notwithstanding it was not sought by trial counsel.82 The contrast between that case and the present is that the concoction of evidence with a witness and the lies clearly gave rise to an inference that they were done as a result of the appellant’s consciousness of his guilt. Such an inference was not logically available from the statements made by the appellant that were the subject of grounds 2 and 3.83 R v Nguyen [2001] VSCA 1; 118 A Crim R 479 concerned a trial for the shooting murder of the applicant’s stepson in the kitchen of the family home. The applicant’s case was that the weapon had been accidentally discharged as he was cleaning it. There was evidence that almost immediately after the incident the applicant had left the house and concealed the weapon and that he later disposed of it so that it was never recovered. He had also lied to the police in saying that some unknown intruder was responsible for the shooting and he encouraged his wife and stepdaughter to provide a similar version. The prosecutor made submissions to the jury concerning these lies and other post offence conduct that were characterised by Winneke P (at [6]) as an invitation to use them as demonstrating that the applicant had the necessary intent to support the charge of murder as opposed to the claim of accident that the applicant had advanced. 84 The prosecutor had sought to rely upon the evidence as giving rise to an inference of consciousness of guilt but the trial judge ruled that was impermissible because the lies and other conduct were no longer material to the issues in the trial, given that the applicant had acknowledged in his evidence that it was he who had discharged the weapon. The trial judge gave the jury a direction in accordance with Zoneff v The Queen. That is, he directed the jury that the evidence was relevant to the applicant’s credibility but could not be used as evidence of guilt. The applicant’s counsel did not seek any further direction. 85 Winneke P held that the directions were inadequate in the circumstances: 
     
      
       
        
        [18] …(I)t seems to me that there was a real risk in this case that the jury would use the applicant’s immediate post-offence conduct as probative of his guilt. It was the conduct of the applicant, immediately after the shooting, in concealing the weapon and thereafter pretending to police that an intruder had shot the deceased, which, because it was capable of being used to prove intent, put the applicant at risk in the absence of proper directions. It was this combination of the concealment and pretence which gave the evidence its probative value. It did not lose its probative value, as the judge appears to have thought, simply because the applicant thereafter conceded that he was holding the gun when it discharged. If anything, that only accentuated the materiality of the evidence because the issues were narrowed to ‘voluntariness’ and ‘intent’. These issues could only be determined by the drawing of inferences and the jury were invited to draw those inferences in part by relying upon the post-offence behaviour of the applicant. Post-offence conduct, including lies, only becomes probative because it stems from a consciousness of guilt. The strength of its probative value, however, will depend upon its nature and the use which is sought to be made of it. It will rarely be the case that its strength is such that it can prove guilt directly. Generally, as here, it will form part of the body of circumstantial evidence from which the jury is asked to infer the guilt of the accused. Where that is the case, it has been said that the employment of the term ‘consciousness of guilt’ is misleading because it suggests a conclusion about the conduct which undermines the presumption of innocence. However, where the conduct is being used, and is capable of being used, to prove guilt, the trial judge must, in my view, be astute to the clear possibility that the jury will so use it, and to give such directions as are needed to ensure that it is not misused. (Footnotes omitted). 
        
       
      
    86 There is a clear contrast between that case and the present. The evidence there was of considerable significance in the prosecution case that the appellant had acted voluntarily and with intent in the otherwise inexplicable shooting of his stepson. The evidence in the present case could in no way be characterised as having significance to the issues the jury were called upon to determine.87 Reference was made to R v Ali [2002] VSCA 194; 135 A Crim R 426. In that case the applicant was charged with having committed a serious assault upon a fellow inmate in a cell in a complex attached to the Melbourne Magistrates Court. The cell had been occupied by a number of other inmates but it was alleged that the applicant was the sole perpetrator of the assault. The prosecutor submitted to the jury that certain lies and post offence conduct by the applicant was demonstrative of his guilt. There was evidence that the victim’s blood was on the applicant’s shoe and that immediately after the incident the applicant washed his shoe in a basin in the cell. The prosecutor submitted, “Why was he getting blood off it? Because he was the guilty man? His conduct afterwards demonstrates his guilt”. There was also evidence that the applicant had suggested to a prison officer that the victim had suffered an epileptic fit. The prosecutor submitted, “Ali knows, of course, that that is not true. Ali knows what has happened in that cell. Why does he say? (sic). His attempt and the only one to say anything like that, his attempt to hide what he has done is demonstrative and eloquent of his guilt”. The trial judge did not give an Edwards direction. The applicant’s counsel specifically disavowed any request for same. It was held by Phillips CJ, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, that such a direction should have been given, at least to warn that there may be explanations for the telling of lies or other post-offence conduct which did not involve a consciousness of any guilt.88 Obviously in that case, with the prosecutor submitting that the evidence of the appellant’s post offence conduct demonstrated his guilt, an Edwards direction was required. The prosecutor in the present case made no such submission.89 In R v Juric [2002] VACA 77; 129 A Crim R 408 at [39] – [41] there are statements concerning the need for directions in a case in which there is evidence that the accused has sought to rely upon a false alibi “because there is a danger that (the jury) will immediately conclude that the accused is raising it to conceal his guilt” and “(t)he raising of a false alibi may well demonstrate a consciousness of guilt”. Mr Odgers contended that this applied a fortiori in a case such as the present where, he submitted, there was evidence of the appellant seeking to raise a false alibi not for himself but for an alleged co-offender. I have earlier indicated my conclusion that this is not how the statement by the appellant that he arrived before the robbery can be characterised.90 In R v ON [2009] QCA 62 it was alleged that the appellant had committed a variety of sexual offences against his step-daughter when she was aged between 13 and 20. There was evidence of a pretext telephone conversation between the complainant and the appellant a little over a year after the last alleged offence. The complainant made reference a number of times in very broad terms to what had gone on between them in the past. The appellant did not make any admissions but he also did not deny any of the conduct referred to. The prosecutor submitted to the jury that the appellant’s failure to deny any of the assertions of sexual misconduct was demonstrative of a consciousness of guilt. No Edwards direction was sought or given. Holmes JA, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, stated: 
     
      
       
        
        [41] And once the prosecutor invited the jury to conclude that the conversation demonstrated a consciousness of guilt, upon which it could act, it was incumbent on the trial judge to give a direction of the Edwards type, with the jury being cautioned that it should consider whether there might be other reasons than consciousness of guilt for the appellant’s responses, and that the relevant consciousness of guilt must be in relation to the offences charged, not some other misconduct.  
        
       
      
    91 It was held (at [42]) that a miscarriage of justice had occurred because of a risk that the jury regarded the conversation as, in some unspecified way, indicative of guilt.92 This case can be distinguished as the prosecutor submitted that the failure of the accused to deny the allegations put to him by the complainant was demonstrative of a consciousness of guilt, which is significantly different to the present case.93 Finally, reference was made to R v SBB [2007] QCA 173; 175 A Crim R 449. It involved an allegation of a sexual assault by the appellant upon his five year old stepson. There was evidence that after he had been charged the appellant sought to have the child say that he had made up the allegations because he was angry with the appellant and also sought to have the child not appear at court. The prosecutor referred to these matters in his address to the jury, submitting, “Are these the actions of an innocent man who had nothing to fear from the truth?”. It was held that, notwithstanding the absence of any request by defence counsel, the jury should have been given an Edwards type direction in order that they consider other possible explanations for conduct which were consistent with innocence in order to prevent reasoning that the conduct could only show guilt.94 The prosecutor’s submission that the actions of the accused were motivated by a fear of the truth invited consciousness of guilt reasoning, far removed from what was submitted by the prosecutor in the present case.Conclusion95 I am not persuaded that either ground of appeal has merit. I propose that leave to rely upon each ground be refused and that the appeal be dismissed.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Objection has been taken by Mr Santisi who appears for the accused to the tender of the contents of an interview which his client had with police officers. I have read a transcript of that interview and viewed an electronic recording of the early part of the interview. 2 The objection is taken on two grounds. The first is that Mr Santisi says that the police officers have failed to comply with the requirements of s 139(1)(c) of the Evidence Act, which requires that before starting questioning, the investigating official caution the person that the person does not have to say or do anything, but that anything the person does say or do may be used in evidence. It is important to understand here that the accused is far from fluent in the English language, and was assisted in the course of the interview by a Vietnamese interpreter. Of course I do not understand what was said between the interpreter and the accused when they were conversing in Vietnamese. I can only go on and rely on the words spoken in English.3 The second aspect of the objection is that it was - according to Mr Santisi - improper for the officers to proceed the way they did, because it was incumbent upon them to ensure that the accused understood the caution that was given to him. I should also make reference at this stage to s 139(3) which requires that the caution is given in or translated into a language in which the person is able to communicate with reasonable fluency.4 As I said, the interview was conducted with the aid of an interpreter. The interpreter spoke to the accused in what I understand was Vietnamese, and there has been no suggestion that the accused was not reasonably fluent in that language. I am satisfied that the police did not act improperly, either under s 139(1)(c) or more generally. I am satisfied that the accused well understood that he had the right to remain silent. 5 The relevant parts of the interview include these: at question 7 the officer says this:  
     
      
      “We intended to ask you further questions in relation to this matter, but before we do I must caution you that you do not have to say or do anything, but anything you do say or do may be used as evidence. Do you clearly understand this caution?” 
      
    As the interpreter is speaking to the accused after the police officer said those words in English, it is apparent that the accused nodded throughout. The answer given by the interpreter on behalf of the accused to that question was “Yes”. 6 The officer then, quite properly, asked the accused to tell him in his own words his understanding of the caution. This is the answer given:  
     
      
      “It is like those questions put to me there is no-one here forced me to say anything, but whatever I say is true that I am willing to say in no-one else is asked me.” 
      
    When that answer is looked at in the light of the following two questions and answers, it is apparent that the accused is not only explaining his understanding of the words that were just said to him, but goes on to volunteer his asserted honesty. I do not understand all of what he says to be his explanation of the caution that was given to him. Part of it is, as I said, but also part of it is him volunteering the idea that he will be telling the truth to the police officers.7 These words are important: coming at the end of his answer to question 10. The accused says, “I have the right to refuse to answer”. Those words are rather important because Mr Santisi puts as one of his arguments the proposition that the words addressed to the accused did not make it clear that he had a right to refuse to answer. I had trouble with this submission when Mr Santisi put it to me. The officer complied with 139(1)(c) and the difference between telling someone that they do not have to do or say something, and telling them that they have a right not to do or say something, is one which escapes me. Nevertheless, the accused answers in a way which indicates that he understood that he had such a right in any case.8 Further of importance is the circumstance that the police officers give a document to the accused which sets out, in the Vietnamese language as I understand it, the caution that the officer had earlier given in English. I am prepared to proceed on the assumption, and Mr Santisi did not suggest otherwise, that the document given to his client was a Vietnamese translation of the words which the police officer had already spoken, that is, that in Vietnamese the document said that the person does not have to do or say anything, but anything the person does or says may be used in evidence. Thus, that is a complete answer as I can see it to the suggestion that the police did not comply with 139(3). 9 I should point out that when that document was given to the accused, he appeared to read it and took a few minutes to do so before signing his name on that document. I should also point out that the police officers remind the accused that he does not have to answer their questions on at least two other occasions at questions 49 and 74. And finally, I should draw attention to the circumstance that police actually arranged for the accused to speak to a solicitor. We of course do not know what was said during the conversation that the accused had with this solicitor, but it would be a fairly safe assumption that during that conversation the solicitor explained to the accused that he did not have to answer police questions if he did not want to.10 In those circumstances I have great difficulty in understanding how it could be suggested that the police have acted improperly. They have, as far as I can see, done a great deal to ensure that the accused understood that he did not have to answer their questions and that if he did what he said would be used in evidence against him. I am satisfied also that it is apparent that the accused understood that, both from what he said to the police and his actions during the interview.11 On of Mr Santisi’s points is that the police officer fails to tell the accused that what he says can be used in evidence against him. Mr Santisi makes the point that although the officer says that the accused’s statements can be used in evidence he does not say that that could be evidence against him. I reject that argument as somewhat fanciful given the circumstance that immediately before the officer cautioned the accused he told him that he was investigating an allegation that the accused was in possession of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine, also known as ‘ice’, and that he imported a commercial quantity of amphetamine. I have got no doubt at all that the accused well understood that if he said something to the police it could be used as evidence against him.12 The material before me satisfies me that the police not only cautioned the accused as they were required to but also that the accused understood the caution. 13 I note in passing, although I have not found it necessary to take this matter into account, that there was no evidence from the accused, to suggest that he did not understand the caution, put before me on this application. 14 The result is that the interview will be admitted.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Howie J that this Court should not intervene and the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    2 When an offender has already served a period in custody for the offence for which he is being sentenced he or she will always consider the sentence process to be unjust unless they are assured that the pre-sentence custody is reflected in the sentence. Because sentences are expressed by reference to years and months confidence in the system is best maintained by commencing the sentence at a date when the period of pre-sentence custody can be clearly identified as having been taken into account. Although there will be cases where this is not appropriate they should be infrequent. 
     
      
    3 HOWIE J: This Court has repeatedly stated that the preferable course to adopt, where an offender has served a period of pre-sentence custody, is to backdate the sentence imposed by a period equivalent to the pre-sentence custody. In R v English [2000] NSWCCA 245, Giles JA stated (my underlining): 
     
      
       
        
         
        [22] This Court has on a number of occasions said that it is desirable that a sentencing judge back-date a sentence to take into account pre-sentence custody. It is not necessary to go further back than R v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588 and what may be regarded as the definitive decision in R v Deeble (19 September 1991, unreported), in which the reasons for the practice are outlined: they need not be repeated here. Subsequent cases included R v Reid (26 March 1997, unreported) and R v Foster (30 October 1996, unreported).  
        The desirability is put not as something which is mandatory, but as a rule of practice of importance, and in my view the importance should be emphasised once again. If a sentence is not back-dated to take into account pre-sentence custody the reason or reasons for not doing so should be clearly stated. 
        
       
      
    4 In R v Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309 Wood CJ at CL stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [25] It is not clear why the two periods of pre sentence custody were not demonstrably reflected in the sentencing order. In my view, error did occur in this respect, having regard to the provisions of s24 as well as s47(2) and s47(3) of the Act, and to the principles and practice discussed in McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588; Deeble NSWCCA 19 September 1991, and English (2000) NSWCCA 245. Although I otherwise consider the sentence appropriate, in the absence of any statement or reason for not backdating for the periods in question or for reducing the sentence from the other end, I am of the view that the Court should intervene to adjust them accordingly. 
        
       
      
    5 In R v Phillips [2002] NSWCCA 167 James J stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [58] S24 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act required his Honour to take into account any time for which Ms Simpson had been held in custody in relation to the subject offence. S47(3) of the Act is generally to the same effect. However, there is no legislative requirement that the sentence be backdated to take into account a period of pre-sentence custody. There is much authority on the other hand as to the desirability of such a course. Thus, reference may be made to the well known passage in the judgment of Chief Justice Street, speaking on behalf of this Court, in Regina v McHugh (1985) 1 NSWLR 588 at 590-599 where the Chief Justice said: 
         
         
          
          ""It is desirable sentencing practice that, where there has been a period of pre-sentence custody exclusively referable to the offences for which the sentence is being passed, the commencement of the sentence (and the non-parole or non-probation period) should be backdated for an equivalent period. This is to be preferred to a process of assessing the proper sentence (non-parole or non-probation period) and allowing, as it were, a discount in consequence of the pre-sentence custody. The desirable practice will promote the accuracy of the record, preventing there being a hidden factor affecting the length of the custody involved in consequence of the sentencing order."" 
          
         
         
        [59] Over the years, the practice recommended by the Chief Justice has been regularly applied. (See for example Regina v Deeble (unreported CCA 19 September 1991) and Regina v English [2000] NSWCCA 245.) 
         
         
        [60] Although the practice was not followed in Regina v Frascella [2001] NSWCCA 137 and Regina v Rose [2001] NSWCCA 370 by two judge Benches of this Court, it has been more recently followed and affirmed in the judgment of a Full Bench of this Court in Regina v Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309…….. 
         
        
       
      
    6 In R v Newman and Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102, 145 A Crim R 361 I stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [23] It should be noted that McHugh was a case in which the appellant had continued in custody for a considerable period up to the date he was sentenced. This Court has repeatedly emphasised the importance of the practice being followed regardless of the different sentencing regimes in force from time to time. See, for example, R v English [2000] NSWCCA 245. However, it has been acknowledged that the sentencing judge can depart from the practice in an appropriate case and where reasons are given for doing so. See Leete (2001) 125 A Crim R 37. 
         
         
        [24] It is trite law that a sentencing court must take into account the period served in pre-sentence custody where that period is referrable to the offence for which sentence is being passed. The court is required to take that matter into account by s 24(a) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Section 47(3) of that Act also obliges the court to take time served into account when determining the commencement date of a sentence. 
         
         
        [25] It is also trite law that the time spent in pre-sentence custody should be a matter to be considered in fixing the length of the non-parole period. In those cases where the sentence is backdated to a period before the sentence is imposed, the non-parole period will automatically be reduced by an amount equivalent to the reduction in the head sentence. This is because the non-parole period must begin on the date when the head sentence commences. 
         
         
        [26] The difficulty arises in cases where, as here, the pre-sentence custody did not continue unbroken to the date of sentence. In such a case the court is faced with two options: it can simply state that the pre-sentence custody is being taken into account and reduce the sentence accordingly; or it can backdate the sentence even though the offender was not actually in custody on the date when the sentence is deemed to have commenced. Notwithstanding some doubt expressed about the latter practice in R v Sayak (NSWCCA, unreported, 16 September 1993), this Court has dealt with the matter in this way on more than one occasion. See R v McDonald (NSWCCA, unreported, 12 December 1995); R v Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309, and R v Phillips and Simpson [2002] NSWCCA 167. There is nothing in s 47 of the Act that would suggest that a court could not make such an order. 
         
         
        [27] In my view, although there is an element of fiction involved in backdating a sentence to a period when the offender was not in custody, there is much to be said in its favour. Firstly, it preserves the denunciatory and deterrent value of the sentence to be pronounced. If a sentence is decreased by a substantial period already served in custody, it can have the appearance of being inadequate both to public perception and when it appears in the statistical information that is now so often relied upon by sentencing courts. This was one of the reasons expressed in McHugh for the adoption of the practice and it remains a highly important consideration.

       [2007] NSWCCA 329; 178 A Crim R 281. 
       
      
    7 Despite the repeated endorsement of this Court for the preferable course of backdating a sentence to reflect the period of pre-sentence custody, this is yet another case where the sentencing judge has not taken that course and yet given no reasons for not having done so. The result is an application for leave to appeal that could have been avoided by the simple expedient of commencing the sentences imposed upon the applicant six months earlier than the date of sentencing. 
     
      
    8 I cannot understand why the preferred course is not universally adopted. It has everything in its favour as was made clear in the decision in McHugh almost 25 years ago: it is simple, transparent and does not result in an apparently lesser sentence being imposed than was actually served by the offender. There is nothing that can be said in support of the alternative method. In my view it should cease unless there is a good reason, which the judge clearly specifies, for not adopting that approach. One reason was referred to in White v R [2009] NSWCCA 118 in the following passage: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [12] There are a number of situations in which it would, or might, be inappropriate to adopt the preferable backdating approach. There is the example referred to in R v Deeble, supra, of a sentencer preferring to discount rather than backdate a sentence to three years or less so as to make the offender’s release on parole on the expiration of the non-parole period an entitlement rather than an eligibility: see, similarly, R v Leete [2001] NSWCCA 337 ; (2001) 125 A Crim R 37 at [29]. Alternatives to imprisonment and alternatives to full-time imprisonment are inapt for backdating and there is a statutory bar in the case of periodic detention (s 70). 
        
       
      
    9 The applicant in the present matter was convicted after trial of two offences: aggravated robbery contrary to s 92(1) of the Crimes Act and assault occasioning actual bodily harm contrary to s 59 of that Act. McGuire ADCJ (the Judge) sentenced him on 12 December 2008 to an overall sentence of 5 years 2 months and an overall non-parole period of 3 years 2 months. The Judge commenced the sentences from 3 October 2008, that was the date upon which the applicant re-entered custody after being convicted of the offences. The sentences, therefore, were backdated 2 months. 
     
      
    10 However the applicant had served approximately a period of four months before being released to bail. The preferred course would have been for his Honour to have dated whatever sentence he imposed upon the applicant for the two offences from a date roughly six months before the date of sentence. As was made clear in R v Newman and Simpson, it would not have mattered that the commencement date was fictional in that the applicant was at large until 3 October. But his Honour after imposing the sentences stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In fixing sentence, I have taken into account the offender’s incarceration of approximately four months prior to him being returned to custody on 3 October 2008. 
        
       
      
    11 This Court should be loathed not to take his Honour at his word and find that an error has occurred by a failure to take into account the period of pre-sentence custody. But it has done so; see for example R v Hall [2005] NSWCCA 217. Yet, as Giles JA stated in English, an error can be established simply by the failure of the judge to explain why the sentence was not backdated. But in any event and with the greatest respect, it is difficult to understand how his Honour derived the sentence that he did by having taken the period of 4 months into account. 
     
      
    12 For the s 59 offence his Honour imposed a fixed term of 6 months from 3 October 2008 and expiring on 2 April 2009. It is possible that his Honour thought that the appropriate sentence for that offence was 10 months and had deducted four months from it. But that seems unlikely as a 10 month sentence is a curious starting point particularly as there was no discount involved for a plea of guilty. 
     
      
    13 For the aggravated robbery offence his Honour imposed a sentence of 5 years. That sentence does not appear to have been determined by taking 4 months pre-sentence custody into account. That sentence commenced on 3 December 2008, that is two months after the commencement of the sentence for the s 59 offence. It is difficult to see how that commencement date was derived having regard to the 4 months pre-sentence custody. 
     
      
    14 But this speculation by the Court should be unnecessary and evidences the lack of transparency in sentencing where a judge simply indicates that a sentence has been imposed having regard to a period of pre-sentence custody. If this Court is left speculating about how the period of pre-sentence custody was taken into account, the offender must be at least in the same position. 
     
      
    15 In Starmer v R [2008] NSWCCA 27 Grove J stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [12] However, it is not obligatory for a sentencing judge to adopt the practice and it does not, viewed in isolation, demonstrate error to depart from it. Counsel for the applicant has pointed to cases where this Court has intervened, but in all of them the sentencing proceedings were detected to have been affected by ambiguity so that it was not clearly demonstrated that appropriate account had been given to service of pre-sentence custody; R v Nasher [2005] NSWCCA 238; R v Hall [2005] NSWCCA 217; R v Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309. 
         
         
        [13] In order to attract intervention by this Court it is necessary to show that relevant error has occurred. On some occasions this can be detected by analysis of the sentence structure in terms of ingredient periods and ultimate result but this is not always the case. The task of the sentencing judge is one of assessment and not one of simple arithmetical calculation. There is no requirement for judges to sentence only in “round figures”. 
        
       
       
      I am prepared to find that error has occurred, but the question then raised is whether any lesser sentence is warranted. 
       
      
    16 The aggravated robbery offence took place on 6 November 2007. The applicant confronted the victim when he was riding his bike. The applicant grabbed the handlebars and said that he intended to take the victim’s wallet and watch. He forced him off the bike and then started to punch him. The victim fell to the ground and the applicant kicked him repeatedly and then struck him with a fence paling. He produced a penknife and placed it against the victim’s temple threatening to stab him. He unsuccessfully tried to remove the victim’s watch. The applicant then took the victim’s bike and rode away. The victim suffered some injuries including a wounding to the head. The Judge concluded that the victim might have exaggerated the extent of the attack upon him. He noted that the bike was of “major value” to the victim. 
     
      
    17 The second incident occurred sometime in the early part of 2008. The applicant approached the victim near Mount Druitt Station when the victim was in the company of his granddaughter and daughter. The applicant said. “If you go to court, I’ll punch your fucking head in” and made some threat about getting certain persons “onto him”. He than punched the victim to the mouth. The victim suffered some minor injuries. 
     
      
    18 The applicant denied both incidents but was convicted by a jury. The applicant had a criminal record for various matters including the possession of a knife and violence. He had served a short period in custody. He was subject to four bonds at the time of the offending and the pre-sentence report indicates his response to supervision “was unsatisfactory and deemed to be superficial”. He was aged 28 years of age when sentenced. There was evidence that he had suffered a disturbed background with violence from his father and stepfather. 
     
      
    19 In my opinion the sentence imposed for the s 59 offence was verging on being manifestly inadequate. It can only be justified if it is assumed that it reflects the period of 4 months of pre-sentence custody. The sentence for the robbery offence was completely appropriate given the actual use of violence and infliction of injuries. In my opinion the sentence seen as a whole was lenient. In view of the breach of bonds and his attitude to supervision, the applicant was very fortunate to receive a finding of special circumstances. I am unpersuaded that this Court should effectively reduce the sentence by a further four months. 
     
      
    20 I propose that leave be granted to appeal but the appeal be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentence. The applicant pleaded guilty in the Local Court to a charge of breaking and entering a dwelling house and committing a serious indictable offence, being an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. This is an offence contrary to s 112(2) of the Crimes Act in respect of which there is a maximum penalty prescribed of imprisonment for 20 years and a standard non-parole period of 5 years. 
     
      
    3 On 19 February 2009 Marien DCJ (the Judge) sentenced the applicant to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 3 years and a balance of term of 3 years. The sentence commenced on 19 June 2008 and the applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 18 June 2011. 
     
      
    4 The applicant has raised three grounds of appeal as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. His Honour wrongly concluded that Mr Fisher had told the offender of his animosity towards either or both Ms Saliba and Mr Scott. 
         
         
        2. His Honour failed to give any, or any appropriate, weight to the applicant’s youth. 
         
         
        3. The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
         
        
       
      
    5 There was a statement of facts tendered by the Crown without objection. They were not stated to be the agreed facts between the parties, but there was no suggestion made before the applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing that they were in dispute.  
     
      
       
        
        Facts 
        
       
      
    6 What follows is a summary of facts taken from the statement. The background to the incident giving rise to the charge is that a co-offender, Fisher, had been in a relationship with Ms Saliba. On 14 June 2008, or thereabouts, the two had an argument and Ms Saliba left the premises where she had been cohabitating with Fisher. She took her personal belongings and her daughter. She contacted the victim, Mr Scott, and arranged for him to take her to his home in Ettalong. 
     
      
    7 Ms Saliba and Fisher communicated by text messages. At about 8.30pm that evening she received a text message from Fisher’s mobile phone stating: “ha ha I no you got the fone Tara Im guna fucking smash his face in so soon u lieing slut”. At about 9.40pm the same evening she received another text message from Fisher’s phone as follows: “your fucken gone think you can lie to me mother fucker”. There followed another text message about an hour later that read: “U both fucked up big time”. About an hour later Ms Saliba used the victim’s phone to speak to Fisher. They appeared to be having an argument and the victim took the phone and turned it off. Ms Saliba and her daughter slept in the premises that evening. 
     
      
    8 At about 8.15am the next morning, 15 June, there was a loud banging on the back door of the premises that woke the residents. They heard some person say, “Just kick the fuckin cunt in”. The door was then kicked open and Fisher entered followed by the applicant. Fisher told Ms Saliba to get ready to leave and she refused. Fisher asked where was Mr Scott, the victim. He identified himself and Fisher said to him, “Why did you lie to me cunt”. The victim said, “I’m doing what I had to do”. The applicant immediately attacked him, punching him about the head. Fisher told the applicant to stop and pushed him out through the door. Fisher grabbed Ms Saliba and the victim said, “Just go”. 
     
      
    9 The victim left the house to go to his vehicle to retrieve Ms Saliba’s bag. The applicant approached him and swung a punch that the victim blocked. Fisher left with Ms Saliba, the applicant and another male person in the vehicle. 
     
      
    10 As a result of the assault the victim suffered bumps and bruising to the back of his head and was in some pain and discomfort. 
     
      
    11 Police later spoke to Ms Saliba and Fisher. He told police that the applicant hit the victim. The applicant’s fingerprints were found on the door handle of the premises where the offence took place and he was identified by the victim and another resident. 
     
      
    12 The applicant was arrested on 19 June and initially denied being present at the premises. Later he admitted to having been with Fisher but maintained he did not leave the motor vehicle. He said that he had been at Kings Cross earlier that evening and was intoxicated. 
     
      
       
        
        Subjective case 
        
       
      
    13 The applicant was born on 22 November 1987 and was aged 20 at the time of the offending. He had a criminal record mainly for traffic matters but received a bond for an offence of malicious damage in 2006. There was a psychological report in evidence. The applicant told the psychiatrist that after his parents separated, when he was aged 12 years, he was subjected to physical abuse by his stepfather. He decided eventually to leave home to avoid the abuse. By this time the applicant was using cannabis. He went to live with his sister in Brisbane but was asked to leave when he failed to stop using the drug. 
     
      
    14 At the age of 16 he went to live with his father, but he died within a few months. He entered into a relationship and at the age of 17 he had a daughter and the next year a son from this relationship. They separated in August 2007. The mother brings the children to see him occasionally. He left school in year 9 and is just literate. 
     
      
    15 The applicant told the psychologist that he was on medication for ADHD but stopped using medication from the age of 10. He used cannabis from the age of 13 and ecstasy and speed from the age of 15. His major problem was with the abuse of alcohol. He told the psychiatrist he was intoxicated by alcohol and drugs at the time of the offending. He was receiving counselling in custody for drug and alcohol abuse. The psychologist believed he had gained some insight into his relationship with drugs. 
     
      
    16 There was in evidence a letter from a former employer indicating that he had been a conscientious employee and he would be re-employed in the future if a position became available. 
     
      
       
        
        Sentencing remarks 
        
       
      
    17 The Judge found that the applicant had attempted to minimise his role in the commission of the offence. The reasons for that view form the context in which the complaint in the first ground of appeal arises and will be considered under that ground. 
     
      
    18 His Honour described the offence as of “great seriousness” and remarked that it “involves the invasion of the privacy of dwelling houses and it is a serious interference with private rights of individuals”. He noted that deterrent sentences were appropriate for such offences. He noted the applicant’s record but held it was not an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    19 The Judge rejected a submission on behalf of the applicant that the offence fell “just below the mid range of objective seriousness”. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        In my view, taking into account the aggravating factor that the offence was committed in company and taking into account the degree of force that was used to enter the premises and the violent and terrifying manner in which they must have entered the premises, and taking into account that the offender, I have found, knew that there was a young child in those premises and taking into account also the degree of violence that was perpetrated by the offender on the victim which although that level of violence did not fortunately inflict serious injury on the victim, it would have to be regarded as a serious and sustained assault upon him involving a number of punches to his head. 
        
       
      
    20 The Judge accepted that the plea of guilty was entered at the first available opportunity and therefore warranted a discount “in the order of twenty-five per cent”. He also found that there were special circumstances “warranting a variation in the statutory ratio between the total sentence and the non-parole period”, being that fact that it was the applicant’s first custodial sentence and that he had favourable prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    21 Shortly before imposing the sentence his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Ultimately, however, I have to sentence him for what I have found was a serious offence and as I say, it is an offence which, if there had been no plea of guilty, would have attracted a standard non-parole period of five years imprisonment of course subject to taking into account the subjective case. It is not an automatic imposition of the standard non-parole period when there is no plea of guilty, because the subjective case of the offender must always be taken into account and the objective seriousness offence must be assessed…….. 
        
       
       
      Ground 1 - finding of facts 
      
    22 The complaint is that the Judge was not entitled to find the facts as he did and, in particular, he could not find beyond reasonable doubt that there was a joint criminal enterprise between the applicant and Fisher that violence would be used in order to force Ms Saliba to leave the premises. 
     
      
    23 During the sentencing hearing, the applicant’s representative tendered some reports and then indicated that she would call the applicant to give evidence “briefly just in terms of the remorse”. During examination-in-chief he was asked why he went with Fisher to the premises. He replied: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I was intoxicated at the time and I wasn’t really sure, I was in the car, I seen Mr Fisher go around the back. By the time I got around the back the door was open. The door was only open about 11, 12 centimetres so I walked inside – I went inside to see what was going on because I could hear arguing and yelling and I noticed Mr Fisher was in a scuffle with the victim - ……. 
        
       
      
    24 The following questioning then took place: 
     
      
       
        
         
        HIS HONOUR 
         
         
        Q. Just a moment do you say that you weren’t present when the door was kicked in? 
         
        A. No, I wasn’t, your Honour 
         
         
        …….. 
         
         
        Q. The agreed facts say that there was a loud bang at the back door waking up the victim and the others and they all heard someone say, “Just kick the funking (sic)……cunt in”. Somebody wouldn’t be saying that to themselves, Mr Zammit? 
         
        A. I – I had no, by the time I got around there, your Honour, the door was open. 
         
         
        Q. Well, is it possible that you were so intoxicated you don’t recall that you were at the back door when that happened? 
         
        A. It could be slightly possible but on my – on what I recall of the night I was – I got to the back door at a different time to Mr Fisher. 
         
        
       
      
    25 Towards the end of the applicant’s evidence the Judge attempted to clarify the facts and the applicant insisted that a scuffle was already taking place when he entered the house. He maintained this account even though the Judge pointed out what was contained in the statement of facts. The applicant acknowledged that he had read the facts and complained to his solicitor that “there were bits of the story missing”. At the conclusion of his evidence the applicant said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Just one other thing that all I’m trying to point out was that there was no intentional reason to go there and to do this, it just happened. 
        
       
      
    26 In R v Falls [2004] NSWCCA 335 this Court had to consider the scope of a judge’s entitlement to find facts where an agreed statement of facts has been tendered but the applicant gives evidence inconsistent with those facts. It was held that it was open for the Judge to sentence in accordance with the agreed statement of facts despite the sworn evidence of the offender. With the concurrence of Dunford J, I stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        37 Where, as here, there is an agreed statement of facts placed before the sentencing judge, and there is also material either inconsistent with, or in amplification of, some aspect of the facts in that statement, the sentencing judge should not act upon that material without having brought it to the attention of the parties during the course of submissions so that the parties can deal with it. If the judge determines to sentence the offender on a factual basis other than in accordance with the agreed statement of facts, clearly the judge should refer to that matter during the course of the remarks on sentence. But if the sentencing judge determines to sentence the offender on the basis of the agreed facts, ignoring the material inconsistent with, or in amplification of those facts, then in my view there is no requirement for the judge to refer to the other material either during submissions or in the course of the remarks. Neither party can complain if the sentencing judge acts upon their formal agreement as to what are the relevant facts. 
        
       
      
    27 In the present case the factual issues were clearly raised by the Judge during the applicant’s evidence and with his legal representative during addresses. It is obvious that the Judge dismissed the applicant’s evidence, and he was entitled to do so, not just because it was inconsistent with the facts tendered. 
     
      
    28 The particular part of the findings about which the applicant complains is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Further I cannot accept the offender's evidence that he had no discussion with Mr Fisher beforehand as to the reason Mr Fisher was going to the premises other than to collect Ms Saliba and her daughter. Clearly there had been these threatening text messages from Mr Fisher, sent to the victim's mobile phone, and I find it impossible to accept that in the course of the evening before and in the course of the car journey to the premises, that Mr Fisher had not told the offender of his animosity towards either or both Ms Saliba or {the victim}. 
        
       
      
    29 In my opinion it was open to his Honour to make the findings he did. He was entitled to consider all the evidence including the threatening text messages that indicated that violence would be used against both Ms Saliba and the victim. Once the victim was identified and there was an exchange between him and Fisher, the applicant attacked the victim. There was no other possible reason for him to have done so unless he understood that they were present to enter into the house, and remove Ms Saliba by force if necessary and that the victim was an opposing party.  
     
      
    30 True it is that Fisher immediately stopped the applicant but that might well have been because there was no occasion to use force at that time. The attack upon the victim was unjustified when it occurred, but it does not follow that there had been no agreement between the applicant and Fisher that force might be required to be used against the victim. In my opinion the attack upon the victim is consistent only with the fact that, before they arrived at the premises, the applicant knew of the animosity that had been expressed by Fisher towards the victim and was there to assist him if necessary. It is clear that the door was kicked in by agreement between Fisher and the applicant, whoever it was that actually forced the door open. 
     
      
    31 This ground fails. 
     
      
       
        
        Grounds 2 and 3 - manifest excessive sentence 
        
       
      
    32 The complaint under the second ground is that the Judge paid insufficient attention to the applicant’s age. But that submission can only be justified if the sentence is manifestly excessive having regard to the applicant’s age. 
     
      
    33 I doubt that I would have determined that the offence was mid range, having regard to the types of offences with which the section is concerned. As counsel for the applicant pointed out in this Court, the offence charged was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm and by reason of the maximum penalty is the least serious of the indictable offences that could give rise to the offence under s 112(2). However, frequently the offence committed, or intended to be committed, is a stealing and that offence also carries a maximum penalty of 5 years. It is to be noted, however, it was not alleged in the charge that the applicant entered with any intent to commit an offence. This was very fortunate for the applicant as clearly he entered intending to abduct Ms Saliba, in that they intended to force her to accompany them. 
     
      
    34 The applicant referred to decisions of this Court considering sentences imposed for similar charges. In R v Millar [2005] NSWCCA 202 the sentencing judge found the offence to be considerably below mid range. In R v Price [2005] NSWCCA 285 the judge found the offence fell “quite away below” mid range. In Ngati v R [2008] NSWCCA 3 the sentencing judge made a similar finding. But these are all decisions based upon their own facts. They do not inform the Court about the Judge’s finding in this particular case. 
     
      
    35 In any event, this Court will not usually interfere with a finding by a sentencing judge as to the objective seriousness of an offence: see Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282. In my opinion it was open for the Judge to find it was mid range, but it was at the lower end of that range. 
     
      
    36 In the present case the non-parole period was a result of the Judge finding that a discount of 25 per cent applied for the plea. The subjective case of the applicant was that he was young, with little criminal record, he had a drug and alcohol problem that had not brought him into conflict with the law to any significant degree and there were good prospects of rehabilitation. The non-parole period was 50 per cent of the total sentence, no doubt as a result of the subjective factors. 
     
      
    37 In my opinion, having regard to all the relevant circumstances of the offending and the subjective features, a head sentence of 6 years was excessive even if the offence was just within the mid range of seriousness. It meant a starting sentence before discount of 8 years. As the Judge found, the offending was a result of the applicant’s intoxicated state rather than a reflection of his true character. He had no earlier offences for violence and Fisher was clearly the principal in the enterprise. In my opinion the appropriate starting sentence is 6½ years that should be then reduced by 25 per cent. I have rounded out the figures particularly taking into account that the applicant is getting the benefit of a non-parole that is 50 per cent of the total term. 
     
      
    38 There have been affidavits filed on behalf of the applicant in case the Court was required to resentence the applicant. The applicant has been doing courses while in prison and learning some skills. The contents of the affidavits support his Honour’s conclusion as to the applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation. They justify a finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    39 I propose the following orders. 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The application for leave is granted and the appeal allowed. 
         
         
        2. The sentences in the District Court are quashed and in lieu the applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 2½ years and a balance of term of 2½ years. The sentence is to date from 19 June 2008 and the applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 18 December 2010.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Johnson J. 
     
      
    2 RS HULME J: : I agree with Johnson J 
     
      
    3 JOHNSON J: This is an application by Kowsar Ali for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by his Honour Judge Berman SC following conviction by a jury upon one count of having sexual intercourse without consent contrary to s.61I Crimes Act 1900 and two counts of indecent assault contrary to s.61L Crimes Act 1900. 
     
      
    4 On 14 November 2008, the Applicant was sentenced on the s.61I count to imprisonment for a term of 10 years and eight months, comprising a non-parole period of eight years to commence on 4 November 2007 and to expire on 3 November 2015 with a balance of term of two years and eight months to expire on 3 July 2018. On each count of indecent assault, the Applicant was sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for two years to commence on 4 November 2007 and to expire on 3 November 2009.  
     
      
    5 The maximum penalty for a s.61I offence is imprisonment for 14 years and a standard non-parole period of seven years applies to this offence. The maximum penalty for a s.61L offence is imprisonment for five years, with no standard non-parole period applying to this offence. 
     
      
       
      Facts of Offences 
       
      
    6 What follows is drawn from the remarks on sentence of his Honour Judge Berman SC (R v Kowsar Ali [2008] NSWDC 319).  
     
      
    7 On 3 November 2007, the victim, an 18-year old woman, went out socialising with friends in inner Sydney. She drank more than she should have and her friends decided to send her home to Oyster Bay in a taxi, giving her money for that purpose. 
     
      
    8 The taxi driver who picked her up was the Applicant, then almost 22 years of age. When the victim entered the taxi, she was significantly intoxicated. She had already vomited and did so once more in the taxi. She occupied the front passenger seat of the taxi. The Applicant was well aware of the victim’s state, seeing her vomit out of the taxi window. She was drifting in and out of sleep.  
     
      
    9 At one point, the victim became aware that the Applicant was touching her. He reached up her sleeve and moved his hand down onto her breast. The victim had done nothing to invite such attention and conveyed her lack of consent by pulling away from the Applicant and saying ”No, don’t”. That assault upon the victim constituted the first count of indecent assault of which the Applicant was convicted by the jury.  
     
      
    10 Some time later, the Applicant further indecently assaulted the victim by touching her between the legs. The Applicant had told the police that this was part of consensual sexual activity initiated by the victim. However, the jury clearly rejected that version of events and convicted the Applicant of the second count of indecent assault. 
     
      
    11 At one stage, the victim awoke to find that the taxi had stopped. The Applicant had deviated from the route he would otherwise have taken in order to go into a back street in Beverley Park, where he stopped the taxi. The Applicant caused the victim to move from the front seat to the back seat of the taxi. He took down the right side of her pants, removed a tampon from her vagina, and then raped her by putting his penis inside her vagina, having sexual intercourse with her until he ejaculated. The victim indicated clearly her lack of consent to this activity, saying “No, no, no” and then crying as the Applicant commenced to rape her. She said “No, don’t, take me home now” when the Applicant persisted, but he did not stop.  
     
      
    12 The sentencing Judge found beyond reasonable doubt that the Applicant had turned off the security camera in the taxi in order to ensure that there was no photographic record of what he did. 
     
      
    13 After he was finished, the victim was able to grab her mobile phone, get out of the taxi and call 000. The sentencing Judge noted that the recording of the 000 call was played to the jury and was very powerful evidence in the Crown case, demonstrating clearly the distress of a young woman who had just been violated by a complete stranger.  
     
      
    14 The case for the Applicant at trial was that the victim had initiated sexual activity with him, a version clearly rejected by the jury. The Applicant did not give evidence at trial nor at the sentencing hearing.  
     
      
    15 The Applicant was arrested on 4 November 2007 and remained in custody thereafter.  
     
      
       
      The Applicant’s Subjective Circumstances 
       
      
    16 The Applicant was born in Bangladesh in 1985. He grew up in a poor farming family. He completed high school and started a mechanical engineering degree in Bangladesh, but that was left incomplete when he came to Australia on a student visa in 2005. 
     
      
    17 In 2006, the Applicant completed an accounting diploma in Australia and commenced studying for a bachelor of accounting. However, he did not complete that degree as a result of his arrest and imprisonment since 4 November 2007. Whilst studying, he supported himself with a number of jobs, including employment as a taxi driver.  
     
      
    18 The Applicant has no prior criminal history apart from traffic matters in 2006.  
     
      
    19 A pre-sentence report dated 10 November 2008 from the Probation and Parole Service was tendered at the sentencing hearing, together with a report dated 8 October 2008 from Mr Gregory Fathers, psychologist. The pre-sentence report noted that the Applicant had arrived in Australia in April 2005 on a student visa, which required him to complete tertiary studies for the visa to remain active and that, as he was in custody, the visa may be revoked. 
     
      
    20 The Applicant had remained in continuous custody since his arrest on 4 November 2007. According to the pre-sentence report, the Applicant completed several educational courses in custody including stress management, information technology, health survival and accounting. 
     
      
    21 The Applicant informed the psychologist that he had never had a girlfriend or partner, although it was noted that he had friends and had established a social network amongst his student acquaintances and members of the Bangladeshi community. The Applicant was not said to suffer from any psychiatric or psychological condition or disorder.  
     
      
       
      Grounds of Appeal 
       
      
    22 The Applicant relies upon the following grounds of appeal: 
     
      
       
      (1) the sentencing Judge erred in assessing the objective seriousness of the s.61I offence as above the mid-range; 
       
       
      (2) the sentencing Judge erred in concluding that, because the Applicant had shown no remorse, he was unable to find that there were good prospects of rehabilitation or that the Applicant was unlikely to reoffend; 
       
       
      (3) the sentencing Judge erred in imposing a non-parole period in excess of the standard non-parole period for the s.61I offence; 
       
       
      (4) the sentencing Judge erred in imposing an overall sentence and non-parole period which were each manifestly excessive. 
       
      
    23 The Applicant’s challenge focussed upon the sentence for the s.61I offence. The sentences for the s.61L offences were entirely concurrent with each other and the sentence for the s.61I offence, and had expired by the time that the application for leave to appeal came before this Court. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 1 and 3 - Alleged Errors in Assessment of Objective Seriousness of s.61I offence 
       
      
    24 It is convenient to consider Grounds 1 and 3 together. The Applicant submits that the sentencing Judge fell into error in finding that the offence of sexual intercourse without consent lay above the middle of the range of objective seriousness, and thereafter, in fixing a non-parole period of eight years for that offence.  
     
      
    25 Before turning to the remarks on sentence, I note that his Honour allowed the victim to be identified, with the consent of the victim, for reasons set out in a separate judgment: R v Kowsar Ali [2008] NSWDC 318; 8 DCLR (NSW) 35. 
     
      
    26 His Honour made the following findings concerning the objective seriousness of the s.61I offence: R v Kowsar Ali [2008] NSWDC 319 at [12]-[14], [18]: 
     
      
       
        
        “12 The offence of sexual intercourse without consent carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years imprisonment. It has a standard non-parole period of seven years. The standard non-parole period is appropriate for an offence in the middle of the range for objective seriousness. Here the objective seriousness was high, involving full penile/vaginal intercourse, including the offender ejaculating. He did not, of course, use a condom. I should interpolate here that I have found beyond reasonable doubt that the offender did ejaculate inside Ms Loiterton's vagina. His counsel made a submission at trial that what occurred was some form of coitus interruptus, with the accused managing to delay ejaculation until he got back in to the front seat of the taxi. Given the finding of semen containing DNA which matched that of the accused in Ms Loiterton's vagina, and the extreme unlikelihood that the offender could have delayed ejaculation until he got back in to the front seat of his cab and driven away, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the offender, whom I repeat was not using a condom, ejaculated in Ms Loiterton's vagina. 
         
         
        13 The non-sexual violence associated with the offence appears to have been relatively minor, but that was precisely because of the complainant's vulnerability. Had the offender occasioned actual bodily harm to Ms Loiterton he would have been guilty of a different offence, and it is not a mitigating feature of one offence that a more serious offence was not committed. 
         
         
        14 In assessing whether the offence does fall within the mid range of objective seriousness I take into account the form of the sexual intercourse, the fact that there was ejaculation, that Ms Loiterton was extremely vulnerable and that the offence was premeditated. I am able to find that it was premeditated because the evidence establishes that the offender deviated from the route he would otherwise have taken in order to go in to the back street where the offence took place. I am also satisfied, and I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that the offender turned off the security camera in the taxi in order to ensure that there was no photographic record of what he did. The evidence at trial established that a driver could switch off the security camera by means of a switch located under the back seat. When the taxi was stopped, police found that the back seat was not in its proper position. On top of that, there is the obvious circumstance that there was a substantial gap between the last photograph recorded on the security camera, and the next one, shortly before the police arrived.  
         
         
        … 
         
         
        18 I have found, for the reasons I gave earlier, that the offence of sexual intercourse without consent is above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Even taking into account the mitigating factors in the offender's favour, I have determined that the non-parole period will be greater than that provided for an offence in the middle of the range, that is the seven year standard non-parole period sentence. I have also determined that the sentences for counts 1 and 2 on the indictment will be served wholly concurrently, they being part and parcel really of what occurred to Ms Loiterton that evening. There are no special circumstances in this case. To take into account matters such as the offender's good character in making a finding of special circumstances would be to double count. It is the offender's first time in custody and that has sometimes been held, indeed often been held, to be a special circumstance, but the non-parole period I will shortly announce is the shortest which I consider is appropriate in the circumstances of this case.” 
        
       
       
      Submissions 
      
    27 Mr Corish, counsel for the Applicant, submitted that the evaluation of the objective seriousness of the s.61I offence was erroneous. He submitted that his Honour had paid insufficient regard to the lack of violence in the commission of the offence, and that a finding ought to have been made that the offence lay no higher than the middle of the range of objective seriousness so that a non-parole period not exceeding the standard non-parole period ought to have been fixed. Mr Corish argued that violence may be used without injury resulting, and that the absence of such violence in this case meant that an erroneous conclusion had been reached concerning the objective seriousness of the offence. 
     
      
    28 The Applicant submitted that the mere fact that the victim was a passenger in the Applicant’s taxi did not qualify her as a member of any relevant class of vulnerable victim (s.21A(2)(l) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). It was submitted that the extent of the victim’s vulnerability (due to intoxication), and the advantage taken of it by the Applicant, was not so serious as to warrant it being regarded as a factor which aggravated the offence. Mr Corish submitted that the sentencing judge, in effect, had put to one side the lack of violence whilst emphasising the victim’s vulnerability due to intoxication. He submitted that this was equivalent to double counting (in a manner adverse to the Applicant) on this issue.  
     
      
    29 Mr Corish submitted that the Applicant’s conduct could more properly be described as opportunistic, rather than premeditated. The route deviation was impromptu and the camera was disabled after the journey had begun.  
     
      
    30 Thus, the Applicant submitted that the objective circumstances of the offence did not take the s.61I offence above the middle of the range of objective seriousness.  
     
      
    31 The Crown submitted that no error had been demonstrated in the finding that the victim was extremely vulnerable. She was significantly intoxicated, had been physically ill, and was “drifting in and out of sleep”. It was her level of intoxication which led her friends to place her in a taxi to get home. It rendered her less able to resist the Applicant’s actions. 
     
      
    32 The Crown submitted that the approach of the sentencing Judge at [13] of the remarks on sentence (see [26] above) was correct and that, if actual bodily harm had been inflicted upon the victim, a more serious offence would have been committed.  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    33 This Court has emphasised that characterisation of the degree of objective seriousness of an offence is classically within the role of the sentencing judge in finding facts and drawing inferences from those facts: Mulato v R [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [37], [46]. This Court is slow to determine such matters for itself or to set aside the judgment made by a first instance judge exercising a broadly based discretion, and the question must be whether the particular characterisation was open: Mulato v R at [37], [46]-[47]. 
     
      
    34 The assessment of objective criminality when a standard non-parole period is provided should be approached intuitively based upon the general experience of the courts in sentencing for the particular offence at issue: R v AJP [2004] NSWCCA 434; 150 A Crim R 575 at [13]; R v PGM [2008] NSWCCA 172 at [26]. 
     
      
    35 I am not persuaded that any error has been demonstrated on the part of the sentencing Judge in the assessment of the objective seriousness of the s.61I offence in this case. It was open to his Honour to characterise the offence as he did. In reaching this conclusion, his Honour referred to the fact that penile/vaginal intercourse was involved, ejaculation occurred inside the victim, no condom was used, the offence was premeditated, the victim was extremely vulnerable (due to intoxication and physical illness) and there was relatively minor non-sexual violence.  
     
      
    36 The sentencing Judge had regard to objective features of the s.61I crime which bore upon its place on a range of objective seriousness. It was open to the sentencing Judge to find that the offence was premeditated by the Applicant, in the sense that he took advantage of the victim in the course of the journey, involving travel to a quiet location and disconnecting the camera to avoid a record being made of his crime. This was not a spontaneous or spur of the moment crime. Having determined to sexually assault the victim, the Applicant took considered action to advance his criminal plan. 
     
      
    37 A significant part of the Applicant’s argument related to the absence of non-sexual violence. It is not correct that substantial non-sexual violence is required before a s.61I offence moves above the middle of the range of objective seriousness. The victim was highly vulnerable given her intoxicated state and the Applicant took full advantage of it. He did not need to resort to threats or acts of violence to give effect to his criminal intent. 
     
      
    38 If, of course, the Applicant had intentionally or recklessly inflicted actual bodily harm to the victim at the time of, or immediately before or after, the commission of an offence of sexual intercourse without consent, or had threatened to inflict actual bodily harm by means of an offensive weapon or instrument, he would be liable for the offence of aggravated sexual assault under s.61J Crimes Act 1900, an offence punishable by imprisonment for 20 years and carrying a standard non-parole period of 10 years. The type of injury required to constitute actual bodily harm lies at a low threshold: McIntyre v R [2009] NSWCCA 305 at [44]. It would be wrong, in passing sentence for a s.61I offence, to have regard to the absence of a feature which, if it were present, would constitute a different and more serious offence under s.61J Crimes Act 1900: cf R v Burton [2008] NSWCCA 128 at [90].39 The victim was vulnerable because of her condition, of which the Applicant was aware. The fact that he did not resort to non-sexual violence (beyond the physical movement of the victim from the front to the back seat of the taxi) does not bear significantly on the objective seriousness of the offence. I reject the Applicant’s submission to the contrary. There was no double counting of factors adverse to the Applicant as claimed. 
     
      
    40 No error has been demonstrated in the sentencing Judge’s approach to determination of the objective seriousness of the s.61I offence. The features of the crime relied upon by his Honour in the assessment of this offence as lying above the middle of the range of objective seriousness provided a sound foundation for such a conclusion, which was clearly open to the sentencing Judge. 
     
      
    41 As this finding was foundational to the setting of the non-parole period, I do not consider that Ground 3 has merit. 
     
      
    42 I reject Grounds 1 and 3. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 - Suggested Error Concerning Prospects of Rehabilitation and Likelihood of Commission of Further Offences 
       
      
    43 The remarks on sentence of the sentencing judge included the following conclusions and findings at [7]-[8]: 
     
      
       
        
        “7. Character evidence was called by the accused at trial, although he did not give evidence himself. Even today he has not given evidence but has instead relied on a handwritten document which he asked me to read. At his trial one of his character witnesses said that, from his limited understanding of what was alleged to have occurred, it was the offender who was the victim. I have, of course, to be careful not to impose a longer sentence than would otherwise be appropriate because of the way in which the offender conducted his defence. He was of course entitled, without penalty, to plead not guilty and to put forward a palpably false version of events which portrayed the complainant as a woman prepared to have sex with a complete stranger in the back of a taxi. I mention the nature of the defence case because it is relevant for other purposes, including whether the offender has shown remorse, and his prospects of rehabilitation. I will say quite clearly that the offender has shown no remorse whatsoever. He maintains his version of events when speaking to Probation and Parole officers and a psychologist who prepared a report that was tendered before me today. 
         
         
        8 I repeat, he has shown no remorse. I cannot therefore find that he has good prospects of rehabilitation or that he is unlikely to re-offend in the future. Perhaps the only thing that might tend to suggest that he may not re-offend in the future is the substantial sentence I shall shortly impose upon him.” 
        
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    44 Mr Corish submits that the sentencing Judge fell into error in concluding that, because the Applicant had shown no remorse, the Court was unable to find that there would good prospects of rehabilitation and that the Applicant was unlikely to reoffend. He submitted that the absence of prior convictions and the Applicant’s relative youth were two key factors which would permit a positive finding in relation to prospects of rehabilitation and the likelihood of reoffending, notwithstanding the Applicant’s lack of remorse. 
     
      
    45 The Crown submitted that the Applicant’s continued denial of the offence meant that there was no material available to assess his motives for offending, or to provide insight into the cause of the offending. Further, the only material available to the sentencing Judge was that the Applicant, when provided with a vulnerable victim and an opportunity to rape, did so and, for this purpose, drove to a quiet area and deactivated the security camera in the taxi. The Crown submitted that error had not been demonstrated in this respect. 
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    46 This ground of appeal asserts error on the part of the sentencing Judge in failing to make positive findings in favour of the Applicant that he was unlikely to reoffend and had good prospects of rehabilitation for the purposes of s.21A(3)(g) and (h) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. The onus lay upon the Applicant to demonstrate that mitigating factors of this type ought be taken into account in his favour: The Queen v Olbrich [1999] 199 CLR 270 at 281 [27]-[28].  
     
      
    47 In R v MAK [2006] NSWCCA 381; 167 A Crim R 159 at 169-170 [41], the Court of Criminal Appeal observed that remorse will be a major factor in determining whether an offender is unlikely to reoffend and had good prospects of rehabilitation and that, without true remorse, it is difficult to see how either finding could be made. Considerations of this type were clearly at the forefront of the sentencing Judge’s thinking on this issue.  
     
      
    48 This Court has observed that there can be rehabilitation without confession, and that offenders found guilty after trial are not to be automatically deprived of a finding of good prospects of rehabilitation unless they acknowledge their guilt: Alseedi v R [2009] NSWCCA 185 at [65]. In a different context, it has been said that a medical practitioner who has been deregistered because of proven sexual misconduct is not required to confess before he is reinstated, although continuing vigorous challenge to clearly established guilt may be indicative of continuing unfitness: Zaidi v Health Care Complaints Commission (1998) 44 NSWLR 82 at 100. Similar considerations arise where release on parole is being considered for a sex offender who denies guilt or refuses to undertake a custodial treatment programme: DCU v State Parole Authority of NSW [2006] NSWSC 526 at [46]-[55], [66]-[67]; Lee v State Parole Authority of NSW [2006] NSWSC 1225 at [59]-[64]. 
     
      
    49 Evidence of different types may bear upon an assessment of an offender’s prospects of rehabilitation and likelihood of reoffending: R v Elyard [2006] NSWCCA 43 at [18]-[20], [86]-[92]. Evidence of an offender’s genuine remorse and insight into the offending conduct may be powerful factors supporting a finding of good prospects of rehabilitation and unlikelihood of re-offending: R v MAK at 169-170 [41]. 
     
      
    50 In my view, the sentencing Judge was entitled to focus upon the absence of remorse and insight in this case in determining whether he could be satisfied that a favourable finding ought be made concerning the Applicant’s prospects of rehabilitation and likelihood of reoffending. 51 I am not satisfied that the sentencing Judge excluded from consideration on these issues the Applicant’s prior good character and age. However, even if he did, I do not think that these factors dictated a positive finding in the Applicant’s favour with respect to these mitigating factors. It must be kept in mind that the Applicant had been convicted of very serious crimes and that his own version, characterised as being implausible by the trial Judge, had been rejected. The Applicant did not give evidence at the trial or at the sentencing hearing and submissions with respect to these issues fell to be considered by reference to the available evidence. Having regard to the gravity of the Applicant’s offences, his absence of remorse made it difficult for a positive finding to be made in his favour on these issues. It should be kept in mind that his Honour did not make a finding that the Applicant had poor prospects of rehabilitation and was likely to reoffend. Rather, his Honour’s finding was neutral - he was not satisfied that findings favourable to the Applicant ought be made.  
     
      
    52 In my view, no error has been demonstrated as claimed in Ground 2. However, even if a conclusion could be reached that the sentencing Judge had unduly confined factors to be considered on these issues, I do not consider that any materially different conclusion would be reached if express consideration was given to the Applicant’s prior good character and youth. There would remain for the Applicant a real difficulty in demonstrating that a lesser sentence was warranted in law and should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    53 I would reject Ground 2. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4 - The Overall Sentence and Non-Parole Period for the s.61I Offence Were Manifestly Excessive 
       
       
      Submissions 
       
      
    54 Mr Corish submitted that the total sentence and non-parole period were manifestly excessive for the offence of sexual intercourse without consent. In support of this submission, he seeks to rely upon sentencing statistics and a schedule of cases where persons were sentenced for s.61I offences both before and after the introduction of the standard non-parole period system in 2003. He submits that an examination of these cases supports the contention that the sentence imposed upon the Applicant lay outside the range of sentence appropriate in the proper exercise of sentencing discretion. 
     
      
    55 In addition, he submits that, even allowing for general deterrence having regard to the Applicant’s position as a taxi driver offending against his passenger, the sentence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    56 The Crown emphasised that entirely concurrent sentences were imposed for the two indecent assault offences, with the sentencing Judge approaching the three offences as being part of the same course of criminal conduct committed by the Applicant against the victim. The Crown submitted that the Court is not assisted by sentencing statistics or other sentencing decisions in this case: Davis v R [2009] NSWCCA 279 at [16].  
     
      
       
      Decision 
       
      
    57 To make good this ground of appeal, the Applicant must demonstrate that the sentence was manifestly excessive in the sense of being unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]. There is no single correct sentence, and Judges at first instance are to be allowed as much flexibility in sentencing as is consonant with consistency of approach and as accords with the statutory regime that applies: Markarian v The Queen at 371 [27]. 
     
      
    58 The s.61I offence in this case was a most serious one. As the sentencing Judge found, the victim was vulnerable because of her state of intoxication and ill health, factors of which the Applicant was well aware and took advantage: cf Jalloh v R [2009] NSWCCA 295 at [35].  
     
      
    59 However, there was an additional feature in this case which attracted a significant element of general deterrence. The sentencing judge adverted to it in his remarks on sentencing at [11]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that there must be a substantial component of general deterrence built in to any sentence to be imposed upon the offender. It is a fact of life that every day of the week many members of society drink more than they should, and then need to get home safely. What are they supposed to do? They cannot drive. If they try and get public transport they can be refused access to what little public transport there is these days, and often the only real alternative is to get a taxi. There must be many young people, vulnerable because of their intoxication, in taxis every night of the week, many of whom would be easy prey at the hands of an offender such as Mr Ali. A message must be sent to those who might be tempted to take advantage of that situation for their own sexual gratification, that if they do, they will go to gaol for a long time.” 
        
       
      
    60 The law recognises the vulnerability to crime of taxi drivers because of their occupation: s.21A(2)(l) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Before this provision was enacted, this Court had said that “taxi drivers as a group are entitled to have the protection of the courts - they being in a substantially helpless position against thuggery and sexual attack”: R v Smith (NSWCCA, 7 July 1988, Lee, McInerney and Loveday JJ, BC8801751, page 4). In R v AS; Ex parte Attorney General (Qld) [2004] QCA 259, it was stressed (at [17]) that the taxi service is a very important adjunct to the publicly run transport system. Williams JA (de Jersey CJ and Mullins J agreeing) observed at [24]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Taxi drivers provide a necessary service for the public which requires them at night to take complete strangers into their motor vehicles and often drive to remote, secluded locations. Since society expects that of taxi drivers, society also demands that those who take advantage of the vulnerability of taxi drivers should be severely punished.” 
        
       
      
    61 Of course, the present offences were committed by, and not against, a taxi driver. The vulnerable victim was in his taxi because her friends had taken appropriate steps to see her safely home by that means. The factors which serve to make taxi drivers vulnerable to crime were reversed in this case. The victim was in the taxi, in the company of the Applicant, so that he could safely transport her home. The victim was entitled to expect that the Applicant would drive her home safely, rather than take her to a secluded area where he could sexually assault her. The community is entitled to expect that taxi drivers will not prey upon their passengers. The observations of the sentencing Judge (at [59] above) are apt. This case called for a substantial element by way of general deterrence.  
     
      
    62 As the victim’s taxi driver, the Applicant was in a position of trust, which he seriously abused in the commission of these offences, whilst his passenger was vulnerable in a state of intoxication and ill health: R v Cutts [2005] QCA 306 at [22], [50], [79]. 
     
      
    63 It was necessary for the sentence to be passed on the Applicant to reflect the sentencing Judge’s appropriate finding that the offence lay above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for this class of offence. The standard non-parole period of seven years had direct application given that the Applicant had been convicted after trial: R v Way [2004] 60 NSWLR 168 at 184 [68]. Subjective factors operated in the Applicant’s favour but, in the circumstances of the case, it was necessary for condign punishment to be imposed, reflecting significant elements of specific and general deterrence. 
     
      
    64 I have considered the Applicant’s argument by reference to other sentencing decisions for s.61I offences and sentencing statistics. More than usual caution should be taken with s.61I sentencing statistics, having regard to the wide range of conduct embraced in the definition of “sexual intercourse”: R v Hibberd [2009] NSWCCA 20 at [61]. Further, sentencing decisions and sentencing statistics for offences committed before the introduction of the standard non-parole system are of very limited use: R v Porteous [2005] NSWCCA 115 at [49].  
     
      
    65 I do not consider that the Applicant’s reliance upon other sentencing decisions establishes a range of sentences for s.61I offences which assists an argument that the sentence in this case was manifestly excessive: Jeffries v R [2008] NSWCCA 144; 185 A Crim R 500 at 512 [85]-[89]; Han v R [2009] NSWCCA 300 at [34]. Nor do I consider that the sentencing statistics support such a conclusion. The function of the Courts is to sentence an offender by the application of correct sentencing principles, commencing with the gravity of the offence, and not by reference to the statistical median range of sentences handed down over a period of time: R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58 at [116]. Quite apart from these general notes of caution, the facts of this case bear particular distinguishing features which impact upon the objective gravity of the offence and the need for personal and general deterrence to be reflected strongly in the sentence. 
     
      
    66 In my view, the sentence imposed upon the Applicant for the s.61I offence was open to the sentencing Judge. Of course, the sentences for the two s.61M offences were entirely concurrent with each other and the sentence for the s.61I offences. It has not been demonstrated that the non-parole period, or the full term of the s.61I offence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    67 I would reject Ground 4. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    68 No error has been demonstrated on the part of the sentencing Judge in the imposition of sentences upon the Applicant. Even if error had been demonstrated in accordance with Ground 2, in my view no lesser sentence was warranted in law or should have been passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912. 
     
      
    69 I would grant leave to appeal, but dismiss the appeal against sentence.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed by Charteris DCJ (the Judge) upon a juvenile for four offences of dangerous driving causing death. Each of the offences was contrary to s 52A(1) of the Crimes Act in respect of which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 10 years. The trial of the applicant on aggravated charges of dangerous driving commenced and a jury was empanelled. However, after a voir dire and limited evidence before the jury, there were negotiations between the parties resulting in pleas to the alternative counts on the indictment being accepted by the Crown. Notwithstanding the late pleas, the Judge awarded him a discount of 15 per cent for the utilitarian value of his pleas. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was sentenced on 30 January 2009 to an overall sentence of imprisonment for 4 years with an overall non-parole period of 2 years. The sentences dated from 30 January 2009 and the applicant is to be released to parole on 29 January 2011. The Judge made an order pursuant to s 19(1) of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 that the applicant serve his sentence as a juvenile offender until he attained the age of 21. 
     
      
    4 The following grounds of appeal were filed: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “1. His Honour erred in finding that the Applicant's moral culpability was above mid range in seriousness. 
         
         
        2. His Honour erred in his use of the fact that four deaths were occasioned as an aggravating feature on four different issues. 
         
         
        3. His Honour failed to give adequate weight to the extra curial suffering of the Applicant. 
         
         
        4. His Honour failed to give adequate weight to the applicant's youth and immaturity. 
         
         
        5. The sentencing judge failed to give adequate weight to the Applicant's need for rehabilitation. 
         
         
        6. His Honour the sentencing judge erred in his application of s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987. 
         
         
        7. The total sentence was manifestly excessive and outside the range of sentences appropriate to the Applicant's criminality.” 
        
       
       
        
        The facts 
        
       
      
    5 In the early hours of the morning of 22 October 2006 the applicant was driving a vehicle in which there were four passengers. He was then aged 17 years and 6 months and had held a provisional licence for 3 months. The applicant was following another vehicle driven by an acquaintance. The accident occurred shortly after the applicant had overtaken that vehicle across double unbroken separation lines at a speed of slightly over 100 kph on a wet road at night. Immediately after this manoeuvre he negotiated a bend in the road but was confronted with a further bend to the left. He lost control of the vehicle and left the highway travelling some 60 metres before the vehicle impacted with a tree. The speed at which the vehicle left the road was between 95 to 111 kph. The four passengers were killed. The applicant suffered relatively minor injuries including a fracture of the thumb. 
     
      
    6 The applicant knew that he was restricted to a speed limit of 90 kph by reason of holding a provisional licence. He had travelled on that stretch of road before and said he believed the speed limit was 100 kph although in fact it was 80 kph. The speed limit had recently been altered and there was some confusion caused by the signage on the road. But the applicant had exceeded what he believed to be the speed limit on the road and the limit imposed by his licence. The applicant conceded that he had given no consideration to the danger of his overtaking or that he was putting his passengers at risk. He accepted that he did not pay a great deal of attention to speed limits or road conditions. The vehicle, which was owned by the applicant’s father, had a number of defects that contributed to the accident but were unknown by the applicant. The front tyres were unroadworthy. The rear tyres were directional and fitted incorrectly so that there was a reduced traction on the road surface. 
     
      
    7 The passengers in the vehicles were all known to the applicant and were aged between 16 and 17 years. The Judge recounted the background to the driving and how the persons came to be in the applicant’s vehicle but it is of no relevance to an assessment of the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
       
        
        The subjective case 
        
       
      
    8 The applicant gave evidence before the Judge. He was of good character and had no prior convictions. The Judge remarked on his evidence as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……… He has been through an extraordinary series of events relating not only to the terrible loss of the lives of his friends, his attendance upon each of their funerals, the eventual charging of him and the criminal process including the trial. As I have observed him in court and in the witness box, one could not other than be impressed with the dignity in which he has conducted himself and the way he has addressed the predicament that circumstance has delivered to him.…….. 
         
        
       
      
    9 The applicant described his conduct as “a silly piece of driving” on his behalf. He did not consider that he had been driving in a dangerous manner. 
     
      
    10 He was taking medication to address his depression and his inability to sleep as a result of the accident. He sought medical treatment for anxiety, sleep disorders and depressed mood and was referred to a psychiatrist. He diagnosed the applicant as suffering from chronic post traumatic stress disorder and what is known as “survivor guilt” because his life was spared. With treatment the psychiatrist considered the applicant to have a “reasonably good” prognosis. There was also psychiatric evidence as to “adolescent decision making” and the recklessness of young males as they approach adulthood by reason of different processes in the brain. 
     
      
    11 There was a positive Juvenile Justice report. There was also evidence of the applicant’s employment as an apprenticed motor mechanic since the accident and his satisfactory performance despite the fact that he had no drivers licence. There was other evidence as to the applicant’s good character and standing in the community. 
     
      
       
        
        The sentencing remarks 
        
       
      
    12 The sentencing remarks were lengthy and referred to the evidence in considerable detail. 
     
      
    13 The Judge accepted that the applicant’s impulsiveness in his driving on this particular occasion was linked to the applicant’s immaturity as a seventeen year old. However he held that any seventeen year old of average maturity “knows not to drive at excessive speed, knows not to cross unbroken separation lines and knows to reduce speed on approaching bends”. 
     
      
    14 His Honour referred to the guideline judgment of this Court in R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 543; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252. He noted the applicant’s good character and absence of record, either criminal or traffic. He took into account that the applicant’s grief was greater as the result of the death of acquaintances. He took into account his remorse and plea of guilty. The Judge described the driving as a “fundamental error of judgment and contrary to what the offender knew to be appropriate behaviour”. 
     
      
    15 His Honour noted that the prosecution did not contend that the applicant had abandoned responsibility. However the Judge found that his driving was above the middle range of culpability but not at the very high end: “it is at a point between that”. He also took into account the necessity for general deterrence but found that personal deterrence was not required. He concluded that the applicant was not likely to re-offend. 
     
      
    16 His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        There must be a message sent to young drivers that the courts will impose significant penalties for offences of this nature. I do, as I have said, take into account his youth, it is a significant factor. The sentence I impose will be significantly less than a mature adult could expect. I take into account his good character, I also have regard to his suffering outside the court imposed punishment. His life has been changed dramatically as a result of these events. 
        
       
      
    17 The Judge determined that a sentence of two years and six months should be imposed for each offence. He then turned to the question of accumulation of the sentences. He said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The offences of which the [applicant] has been convicted are ones that are described as ""result offences"". He did not ever intend that his friends would be injured, let alone lose their lives. Many young people, indeed many adults, have driven in the fashion that he has driven but by the circumstance of good fortune have not suffered the result that the driving of [the applicant] has achieved. However, the Parliament is imposing penalties of this nature because of the loss of life; each loss of life is a very significant matter. I must accumulate the penalties. In my view, addressing issues of totality, I should accumulate the sentences so that there will be an effective sentence of four years imprisonment. 
        
       
      
    18 The Judge then turned to the issue of special circumstances. He found special circumstances existed by reason of the applicant's youth, his psychological problems, his need for rehabilitation, and the fact that his apprenticeship had been brought to an end by the sentence to be imposed. The Judge determined that the applicant should serve a minimum period of two years imprisonment. The Judge then imposed sentences in respect of each of the offences in order to bring about the result that he had intended. 
     
      
    19 He imposed the same sentence for each offence being a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 15 months and a balance of term of 15 months. The first sentence dated from 30 January 2009. Each of the other sentences commenced six months after the previously imposed sentence. 
     
      
       
        
        Grounds 
        
       
      
    20 In oral argument the applicant maintained that the principal complaints were (a) that the Judge took undue account of the fact that four persons had died and (b) that his Honour could have structured a sentence to permit the applicant to remain for the duration of his sentence in a juvenile facility in order to aid in his rehabilitation. 
     
      
    21 The written submissions under ground 7, the “manifest excessive ground”, submitted that, if the Court was minded to find in favour of ground 2, “the totality ground”, the Court would substitute sentences that would result in a reduction in the non-parole period to 20 months as against the overall total term of imprisonment of 4 years. In oral submissions it was made clear that this was the adjustment that was being sought regardless of the success or otherwise of any of the particular grounds of appeal. 
     
      
    22 The reason for this submission was made clear in oral argument. Such a non-parole period would result in a sentence that would have the effect of permitting the applicant to be released to parole prior to his 21st birthday and, therefore, he would avoid serving any part of the sentence in an adult prison. It was submitted that this would aid in his rehabilitation. 
     
      
    23 The short answer to both the written submissions and those made orally is that the sentence imposed by his Honour is probably inadequate. The Judge allowed a discount of 15 per cent for the utilitarian value of the pleas and a discount of that degree was entirely unjustified in light of the stage in the proceedings when the pleas were made. But in any event, however derived, a minimum period of custody of 2 years for causing four deaths by the driving in which the applicant engaged does not in my opinion adequately reflect general deterrence and denunciation. In other words, whatever success there might have been on any of the grounds of appeal, the applicant would fail because no lesser sentence was warranted. 
     
      
    24 Certainly no reduction in the sentence could be justified for the reasons put forward by Mr Harrison for the applicant. The suggestion that a sentence should, or could, be constructed with a view to bringing about a certain type of custodial arrangement should be firmly rejected. It is rarely, if ever, appropriate for a sentencing court to take into account administrative arrangements or executive decisions in determining the sentence to be imposed upon an offender. More importantly it would be quite wrong for a judge to seek to avoid a statutory prescription upon where a juvenile offender is to serve a sentence by reducing the sentence to avoid the administrative decision that a juvenile upon reaching the age of 21 is to be transferred to an adult prison. 
     
      
    25 This Court has stated consistently that the proper approach is to determine the appropriate sentence and then consider what, if any, options exist as to how that sentence is to be served. That approach was clearly stated in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17. That decision has been quoted and applied in a large number of decisions of this Court that need not be cited. In a case involving a juvenile offender being sentenced at law, the same principle applies. The judge is to determine the sentence and then consider whether it is necessary and appropriate to make an order under s 19 of the Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act. It would be unprincipled and an error of discretion for the court to reduce a sentence solely in an attempt to avoid a juvenile offender spending a period of custody in an adult facility. 
     
      
    26 In any event, the court’s intention in this regard can legitimately be frustrated by a decision made by the Director General to transfer a juvenile offender pursuant to s 28 of the Children (Detention Centres) Act to a “correctional centre”. Section 19(7) specifically states that the section does not limit the operation of s 28. 
     
      
    27 Although the application should be rejected because it completely lacks any merit, I wish to make some brief comments about the grounds raised and the issues before the sentencing judge. First, His Honour was in error in determining the culpability of the applicant by taking into account that four persons had died. When assessing the moral culpability of the applicant, His Honour referred to the fact that “other than the terrible loss of life and speed” there was no other aggravating factor as mentioned in R v Whyte. Loss of life, however terrible, is not relevant to an assessment of moral culpability: Rosenthal v R [2008] NSWCCA 149. 
     
      
    28 However, one of the factors relevant to an assessment of the applicant’s culpability was the number of persons put at risk by the driving. In Whyte this factor, listed as (ii) in the aggravating factors, was not considered to be a factor impinging upon moral culpability. However, in the Application of the Attorney General (No 3 of 2002) (the High-range PCA Guideline), [2004] NSWCCA 303; (2004) 61 NSWLR 305, with the concurrence of the other members of the Court), I stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [107] But, in my opinion those factors that aggravate the moral culpability of the driver and aggravate the seriousness of the conduct apply with equal force to the offence of high range PCA. These are expressed in  
        Whyte 
         as: 
         
         
        •Degree of intoxication 
         
        •Erratic or aggressive driving 
         
        •Competitive driving or showing off 
         
        •Length of the journey at which others are exposed to risk 
         
         
        [108] I would also add to the list: 
         
         
        •Number of persons put at risk by the driving 
         
         
        Although this was identified as an aggravating factor in  
        Whyte 
        , it was not marked as a matter relating to the moral culpability of the offender. With respect, I agree that this is so if this factor is having regard to members of the public in general. But I consider that a person’s moral culpability is increased where the driver knows that other persons are being put at risk, for example where there are passengers in the vehicle. 
        
       
       
      See also  
      R v Price 
       [2004] NSWCCA 186 at [35] – [36]. 
       
      
    29 In the present case, therefore, although his Honour erred in taking into account the number of deaths as a factor relevant to an assessment of the moral culpability of the offender in respect of the driving causing death, his Honour was in error in not taking into account as an aggravating factor that the applicant was putting at risk the lives of four persons in his vehicle. 
     
      
    30 In the result there was no error in the Judge concluding that the applicant’s moral culpability was high. It was deliberate risk taking, in that he overtook the other vehicle across unbroken centre lines, without any reason to do so. He was travelling at speed on a dark, wet road and where he could not sufficiently see the road in front of him to be aware of what was coming by way either of other vehicles or the characteristics of the roadway. He was an inexperienced driver and the limit on his licence as to the speed at which he could drive was intended to limit the risk of that inexperience resulting in a serious motor vehicle accident. The submission made on behalf of the applicant that the moral culpability was in the low range should be rejected. 
     
      
    31 In light of the Judge’s finding as to moral culpability, a sentence of 30 months was very lenient. When a non-parole period of 50 per cent was imposed the sentence was verging on the inadequate as there was a significant degree of double counting involved. The leniency of the sentences was markedly increased by the limited cumulation between the sentences. 
     
      
    32 Secondly, it would have been a serious error had his Honour not imposed partly cumulative sentences for each of the offences. It has been made clear in decisions of this Court that the number of persons killed is an aggravating factor and will result in an increase in the overall sentence imposed: R v Price at [35]; R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288 at [21]-[25]. The sentence for one offence cannot be increased because of the presence of other offences so that the only way in which an increased sentence can be imposed to represent the total criminality is to at least partially accumulate the sentences for each of the offences. 
     
      
    33 Thirdly, evidence from a psychiatrist as to the immaturity of young males of the age of the applicant was irrelevant. If a young male is old enough to be licensed to drive a motor vehicle, he is to be assumed to be mature enough to comply with its conditions and the traffic rules. In SBF v R [2009] NSWCCA 231; 53 MVR 438 at 151 Johnson J stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [151] Ms Francis referred in submissions to the Applicant “having little appreciation of his own mortality” (T5.35, 22 June 2009). The Applicant’s counsel in the District Court had submitted that “it is also a fact of life that people at this tender age tend to — their brains tend to not allow them to deal with the responsibility that they sometimes demand so vocally” (T6.10, 5 August 2008). In a similar vein, the sentencing Judge in the Victorian County Court in Neethling at [51] had observed that the offender “like many young men … saw [himself] as ‘bullet proof’.” The fact that young men (in particular) may have such perceptions is a significant reason for general deterrence to be a prominent factor in cases such as these. Inexperience and immaturity, in persons aged 17 years and over, cannot operate as mitigating factors where the offender commits grave driving offences, with fatal consequences, as exemplified by Neethling and this case. 
        
       
       
      The reference to “Neethling” was a reference  
      DPP v Neethling 
       [2009] VSCA 116; (2009) 52 MVR 422. 
       
      
    34 The majority of the grounds of appeal went to the issue of whether the sentence was excessive having regard to matters that the Judge specifically took into account. The only argument was whether his Honour had given them sufficient weight. It is obvious that the overall sentence was not excessive, quite the contrary. As I have noted, the real basis for the application was that this Court should alter the sentence for a reason that was unprincipled. It, therefore, had no prospect of success. 
     
      
    35 I propose that leave to appeal be refused.

     KELSO, Andrew John v R 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to one count of robbery in company contrary to s 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 20 years. The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 2 years with a total term of 4 years. 
     
      
    2 The applicant was convicted together with his co-offender Luke Bancroft. Bancroft also pleased guilty to the offence of robbery in company. However, he pleaded to a separate offence of armed robbery with which the applicant was not involved. Bancroft was sentenced for the armed robbery to a non-parole period of 2 years with a total term of 4 years 6 months. On the robbery in company charge he was sentenced to a non-parole period of 2 years with a total term of 4 years being the same sentence as the applicant. Bancroft’s sentences were partly accumulated by 6 months. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    3 On 3 April 2008 at about 10.25 pm, the victim arrived at Fassifern Railway Station to catch a train home from work. He had with him his customised Dunlop brand mountain bike. The applicant and the co-offender were also on the station platform. 
     
      
    4 At about 10.40 pm the train arrived en route to Newcastle and all three boarded. Moments before the train arrived at Cockle Creek Station, Bancroft approached the victim and said to him: “Give me whatever is in your pockets and we’re going to take your bike. If not, we’re going to belt the fuck out of you”. The victim stood up and made efforts to escape but was restrained by Bancroft who punched him three times to the face. 
     
      
    5 The victim saw the applicant near the bike rack and noticed that his bicycle had been removed from the rack. He continued to resist and felt punches to the back of his head. He recognised the applicant as having punched him. The victim was restrained and his legs were kicked. Fearing for his safety, he took his mobile phone from his pocket, threw it at Bancroft and managed to escape. After getting to another area of the train, he saw Bancroft had left the train at Cockle Creek railway station. Both his bicycle and his phone had been stolen. He reported the matter to the police. 
     
      
    6 Closed-circuit television surveillance was collected from Fassifern and Cockle Creek railway stations. Based on the victim’s descriptions and the CCTV footage, the police were able to identify the offenders. The applicant was seen leaving the train at Cockle Creek railway station in the possession of the victim’s bike, and in company with Bancroft. 
     
      
    7 On 8 May 2008, the applicant was arrested at Port Macquarie police station. He made partial admissions to the commission of the offence and implicated Bancroft. He informed the police that he was influenced by his co-offender, denied assaulting the victim and said he only assisted in the commission of the offence by stealing the bicycle. The applicant admitted that he was fully aware before he boarded the train that his co-offender was intending to “roll” the victim on the train. 
     
      
       
      Subjective features of the co-offender and the applicant 
       
      
    8 At the time of sentence, Bancroft had just turned 26. He was the father of 6 children aged 5 and under. He had been using ice, marijuana, speed and alcohol on a daily basis for months leading up to the commission of the two offences for which he had been charged. He grew up in a stable family environment. However, he had learning difficulties at school and had been diagnosed with ADHD. He left school when he was 14, and had a sporadic work history. 
     
      
    9 Since he has been in custody, Bancroft has undergone drug and alcohol counselling, an anger management course and a faith-based self-help course, and volunteered to carry out maintenance and yard work. He has taken up reading, weight training and jogging. He accepted responsibility for his actions. 
     
      
    10 Bancroft has criminal antecedents dating back to when he was 17 when he appeared before the Children’s Court for offences of possessing prohibited drugs and malicious damage. As an adult, he has convictions for possession of a knife in a public place, common assault, drug possession, intimidation and contravening an apprehended violence order. He has received fines, community service and supervised bonds requiring him to submit to psychiatric or psychological counselling. 
     
      
    11 The sentencing judge found that Bancroft was truly remorseful and contrite, had taken steps to rehabilitate himself, had used his time in custody productively and had insight into his offending behaviour. His criminal antecedents disentitled him to a finding of good character, but were not such as to disentitle him to any leniency at all. A 25% discount was given for his guilty pleas. 
     
      
    12 The applicant at the time of sentencing was almost 22 years of age. He was brought up in a close-knit family leading a normal life. He was diagnosed with ADD as a child. At the time of the offence he was involved in a tumultuous relationship. Drugs and alcohol were not a problem for him. His mother gave evidence that she had noticed since his arrest and subsequent counselling a change for the better in the applicant. He was associated with a job-seeking group at Wallsend and had been attending courses to enhance his prospects of obtaining employment. 
     
      
    13 The sentencing judge commented that the applicant had “one minor matter on his criminal antecedents, a driving offence for which he was fined and disqualified from driving for twelve months. He is a person of otherwise good character.” An offence of common assault dealt with at Port Macquarie Local Court on 23 October 2008 by way of fine had not appeared on the antecedents tendered during proceedings. As did Bancroft, the applicant received a discount of 25% for his plea. He was found to have good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
       
      Some remarks of sentencing judge 
       
      
    14 The sentencing judge found that the applicant played an active role in the robbery and in taking the victim’s bike, and that contrary to his denial to police, he did in fact assault the victim. He knew of the intention of his co-offender to commit the offence and was a willing participant. He was not affected by drugs or alcohol and was not mentally impaired. Her Honour said that his culpability was “on a par with his co-offender despite the disparity in age and criminal antecedents.” This statement was not correct. The applicant’s age and criminal record are not relevant to the issue of culpability for the offence. 
     
      
    15 The sentencing judge found that any sentence imposed on the offenders must attract a significant component for general deterrence. Her Honour considered the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 106 A Crim R 149, in particular the features common to robbery offences, and the possible range of sentence. 
     
      
    16 Her Honour concluded that the offence had the characteristics of an offence considered in Henry: the offenders were young, there was a limited degree of planning; there was actual violence and the victim was vulnerable, being a train traveller, late at night, alone on a train. Her Honour found that the victim’s bicycle was not of great monetary value but it was significant to him as he used it to transport himself to and from work. His phone was also taken.  
     
      
    17 Her Honour found that the emotional and/or physical harm suffered by the victim was not substantial. 
     
      
    18 The applicant advances two grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: the applicant suffers a justifiable sense of grievance when comparing the sentence imposed on him with the sentences imposed on his co-offender Luke Bancroft 
       
      
    19 Under this ground of appeal, the applicant submitted that there were three matters which justified a lesser sentence for the applicant than for Bancroft. It was firstly submitted that at the time of the offence the applicant was 21 years of age, making him five years younger than Bancroft. The applicant complained that the sentencing judge failed to give any weight to this factor.  
     
      
    20 Secondly, it was submitted that whereas Bancroft had a criminal record dating back to when he was 17 years of age and, more particularly as an adult had convictions for the custody of a knife in a public place, common assault, drug possession, intimidation, and contravening an apprehended violence order, the applicant was of good character and had no prior criminal history of any relevance. Although the offences which Bancroft had previously committed did not result in him receiving a sentence of full time custody, he had been placed on community service orders and bonds. It was nevertheless submitted that the criminal history of Bancroft was of such significance that it should have resulted in a greater sentence for Bancroft than that which was imposed on the applicant. 
     
      
    21 The third matter raised by the applicant was that as compared with Bancroft, his role in the offence was less. It was submitted that the applicant’s immaturity had made him vulnerable to being led by others and that this was the case with the present offence. 
     
      
    22 The principles must be considered when complaint is made of disparate sentences are well understood. It is not enough that there is disparity in the sentences. Some disparities are inevitable. In Postiglione v R (1996-1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301 Kirby J at 338 remarked that “mere disparity is not enough to justify intervention by an appellate court.” Before this Court will intervene, the disparity of the sentences must be such “as to engender a justifiable sense of grievance by giving the appearance, in the mind of an objective observer, that justice has not been done.” Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606. 
     
      
    23 The principles were recently reviewed by Howie J in England & Phanith v R [2009] NSWCCA 274 at [62] where his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It should be borne in mind that the High Court’s decisions on this area of appellate intervention speak of ‘gross’, ‘marked’, ‘glaring’, or ‘manifest’ disparity. These terms are used throughout the judgment in  
        Lowe v R.  
        Another way of considering the issue is to ask whether the two sentences give rise to an appearance that justice has not been done per Gibbs CJ at 610 and Dawson at 623.” 
        
       
      
    24 In the present case consideration of the sentencing judge’s remarks confirms that her Honour was careful to identify the factors relevant to each offender. It is apparent that her Honour was mindful of the fact that she was obliged to ensure that the sentence imposed on the applicant was appropriate bearing in mind the sentence she imposed upon Bancroft. 
     
      
    25 However, her finding that the applicant and Bancroft were equally culpable was informed, inter alia, by considerations relevant only to the subjective circumstances of each offender. To my mind this led to problems that are ultimately reflected in a failure to appropriately distinguish between the personal circumstances of each offender. Because of the difference between Bancroft’s age and his antecedents compared with the applicant, I am satisfied that the applicant should have received a lesser sentence than Bancroft. 
     
      
    26 To my mind the sentence imposed on Bancroft was lenient. However, there is no Crown appeal and the appropriateness of the applicant’s sentence must be considered by having regard to the sentence which was imposed. The applicant had been previously convicted. One conviction was for a traffic offence and the other was for a minor assault. The course of criminal conduct which Bancroft had previously engaged in was far more serious than that of the applicant. The applicant was a number of years younger than Bancroft, the early twenties being a significant period in the maturation of young adults. In my judgment the applicant was justifiably entitled to expect that he would have received a lesser sentence than Bancroft. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – manifest excess 
       
      
    27 This was a serious offence committed on an innocent person travelling in the late evening on public transport. Although no weapon was used, there was actual violence inflicted on the victim by both offenders who acted in company. The offence carries a maximum penalty of 20 years imprisonment which emphasises the legislature’s concern that the law should do what it can to protect those who travel on public transport from attack by persons intent upon robbery. 
     
      
    28 The applicant submitted that when consideration was given to the guideline judgment in R v Henry (1999) 106 A Crim R 149; (1999) 46 NSWLR 346 at [162] the sentence imposed on him was manifestly excessive. In R v Murchie (1999) 108 A Crim R 482 this Court held that the Henry guideline was equally applicable to the offence of robbery in company for which the same maximum penalty is prescribed. However, the applicant stressed that whereas he had entered an early plea the guideline in Henry was referrable to a late plea of guilty.. 
     
      
    29 To my mind consideration of the Henry guideline does not lead to the conclusion that the sentence was excessive. In that case this Court said that where an offence of armed robbery is characterised by the following features the sentence imposed should fall within the range of 4 to 5 years imprisonment. Those features are:  
     
      
       
      (i) young offender with no or little criminal history 
       
      (ii) weapon like a knife capable of killing or inflicting serious injury 
       
      (iii) limited degree of planning 
       
      (iv) limited, if any, actual violence but a real threat thereof 
       
      (v) victim in a vulnerable position such as a shop keeper or taxi driver 
       
      (vi) small amount taken 
       
      (vii) plea of guilty, the significance of which is limited by a strong Crown case; 
       
      
    30 The applicant may be appropriately described as a young offender, although he was 21 at the time of the offence. He plainly knew that what he was doing was a serious breach of the law and carried the risk, if apprehended, of incarceration. Although there was no weapon used the offence was committed in company upon a person who was vulnerable, travelling on public transport late in the evening. The offenders had entered the train with the intention of committing the offence which could not be described as spontaneous. Items of relatively modest value, apart from the bicycle were taken. I accept that the applicant was entitled to a greater discount for his early plea than the 10% contemplated in Henry but that would not in my opinion lead to the conclusion that the sentence imposed was erroneous. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    31 Notwithstanding that the sentence was not erroneous because of manifest excess, as I have indicated, the applicant was justifiably entitled to expect that because of the subjective matters to which I have referred he would receive a lesser sentence than Bancroft. I would intervene and resentence. It is appropriate to maintain her Honour’s finding of special circumstances. The non-parole period should be eighteen months with a total sentence of three years. 
     
      
    32 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      1. Leave to appeal granted, the appeal upheld and the sentence imposed in the District Court is quashed. 
       
      2. The applicant is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 3 years with a non-parole period of 18 months commencing on 16 December 2008 and expiring on 15 June 2010 with a further period of 18 months expiring on 15 December 2011. The applicant is eligible for release to parole on 15 June 2010.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I agree with Simpson J. 
     
      
    2 SIMPSON J: In February 2008 the appellant was tried in the District Court in Campbelltown on an indictment containing two counts. The first count was of indecent assault in circumstances of aggravation, brought under s 61M(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. The second count was of sexual intercourse without consent in circumstances of aggravation, brought under s 61J(1) of the same Act. In each case the circumstance of aggravation was that the alleged victim (to whom I will refer as the complainant) was under the age of 16 years. She was in fact 12 years of age. Each offence was alleged to have been committed during the period between 1 November 2006 and 15 December 2006. 
     
      
    3 The jury returned a verdict of guilty on each count. The appellant was duly sentenced (to an aggregate term of imprisonment for 7 years, with a non-parole period of 2½ years). He now appeals against the conviction. He does not seek leave to appeal against the sentences. 
     
      
       
      The Crown case 
       
      
    4 What immediately follows is an account of the case, stripped to its essentials, sought to be made on behalf of the Crown (which may, by reason of the verdicts of guilty, be taken to have been essentially accepted by the jury).  
     
      
    5 Despite the brevity of the following account, it will be necessary in due to course to deal in some detail with the evidence. 
     
      
    6 The complainant was born in June 1994. She had a mild or moderate intellectual disability. She lived with her mother (LA) in Warwick Farm. In 2006 she attended the Miller Public School, enrolled in a special class. In 2007 she attended Lurnea High School. It may be that LA also had some intellectual impairment, although the evidence is not clear on that. 
     
      
    7 In 2006 LA had commenced a relationship with the appellant. From time to time the appellant stayed overnight or for weekends at the home occupied by LA and the complainant. On other occasions LA and the complainant stayed overnight at the appellant’s home. 
     
      
    8 On an occasion between 1 November 2006 and 15 December 2006, while the complainant was in the bath at her home, the appellant digitally penetrated her vagina. Using two hands, he parted the labia and inserted a finger that touched the complainant’s clitoris. This constituted the offence of sexual intercourse without consent, the second count on the indictment. 
     
      
    9 On another occasion during the same period the appellant used his fingers to touch the complainant’s nipple and squeeze her breast. This constituted the offence of indecent assault, the first count on the indictment. 
     
      
    10 The complainant told her mother that the appellant had said to her that he wanted “to lick her out”. She did not report to her mother the conduct the subject of the charges. 
     
      
    11 The Department of Community Services and police became involved (in circumstances that were not elucidated in the evidence). The complainant was twice interviewed by Senior Constable Lainie Shipway, then of the Joint Investigation Response Team, commonly known as JIRT, Liverpool. The first interview took place at the Miller Public School on 12 December 2006, the second at Lurnea High School on 26 April 2007. Each interview was audio recorded, but not video recorded. The first interview was recorded on two tapes, the second of which was at least partially inaudible. 
     
      
    12 On 19 December 2006 Constable Shipway spoke to the appellant. He declined to be interviewed, saying: 
     
      
       
        
        “I didn’t do nothing, so I have nothing to say of the matter.” 
        
       
       
      The trial 
       
      
    13 The trial commenced on 21 February 2008, before Coorey DCJ and a jury. The complainant gave evidence on affirmation from a remote location. Her evidence in chief was given, pursuant to s 9 of the Evidence (Children) Act 1997 (substantially re-enacted as s 306U of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986), by the tapes being played to the jury. She was cross-examined by counsel for the appellant (via closed circuit television). It will be necessary to return to a more detailed examination of her evidence when considering the sole ground of appeal. 
     
      
    14 Evidence was also given by Ms Sandra Martin, the principal of Miller Public School, by the complainant’s mother (LA), and by Senior Constable Shipway. 
     
      
    15 The appellant did not give or call evidence.  
     
      
    16 The evidence concluded on 25 February 2008, and counsel addressed. 
     
      
    17 On 26 and 27 February 2008 his Honour summed up. The jury retired at 11.25am on the latter date. At 12.10pm the jury requested transcripts of the audio recorded interviews with the complainant (specifically requesting the transcript of the inaudible tape recording). At the same time they directed two questions to the judge. They were read on to the transcript by the judge as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Who did [the complainant] report ‘the incident’ to? 
         
         
        How long had [the appellant] known [the complainant] before the alleged incident occurred?” 
        
       
       
      (The jury note was not included in the papers provided to the Court. Whether the transcript accurately records the reference, in each question, to “the incident” in the singular is not clear.) 
       
      
    18 Very fairly, Coorey DCJ decided that the transcript of the audio recordings (which was the complainant’s evidence in chief) ought to be accompanied by the transcript of the cross-examination of her. This was done. 
     
      
    19 Unfortunately, the transcripts of the interviews provided to the jury were not identified, either by being marked for identification, or as exhibits. That has created a complication, because the original transcripts appear to have been subjected to some editing. One rather odd feature, which is said in some way to have resulted from the editing, is that the numbering of the questions and answers is not always sequential. 
     
      
    20 The Court was not convinced that the copies of the transcripts of the interviews contained in the appeal papers were in fact the same as the copies given to the jury. Those actually given to the jury had been destroyed. Eventually the parties provided the Court with documents that they agreed were copies of documents identical with those that had been made available to the jury. It is apparent, however, that these were not identical with those from which the complainant was cross-examined, and it is likely that they did not coincide entirely with the audio recordings that had been played. 
     
      
    21 After discussion with counsel about other matters, his Honour told the jury that there was no evidence of the complainant having reported “the incident” to anybody; and that, on the evidence of LA, the complainant must have met the appellant some time in 2006, on a date that was not specified. The first of these was not quite accurate; there was some evidence in the first interview of the complainant having made a report to her mother. The error is inconsequential, and, in any event, favoured the appellant. 
     
      
    22 The jury not having reached a verdict by 4.00pm on that day, his Honour released them for the evening. They resumed deliberations the following morning and returned the verdicts of guilty at 12.05pm. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    23 The sole ground of appeal is that the verdicts are unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence.  
     
      
    24 The task of an appellate court in determining that ground is well known. It is to ask itself whether, upon the whole of the evidence, it was open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was guilty of the offence charged: M v The Queen [1994] HCA 63; (1994) 181 CLR 487. 
     
      
    25 The test has been endorsed in numerous cases since publication of the judgments in M. In MFA v The Queen [2002] HCA 53; (2002) 213 CLR 606, the High Court emphasised the “special respect and legitimacy” accorded to juries deciding contested factual questions concerning the guilt of accused persons in serious criminal trials. 
     
      
    26 In this case, as is usually the case where this ground of appeal is raised, a consideration of the evidence is required. It is convenient to turn to that now. The evidence has some particular features in this case which will become apparent. 
     
      
       
      The evidence 
       
      
    27 As might be expected in the circumstances (having regard to the complainant’s intellectual capacity) her evidence was not always completely coherent or even consistent. In order to do justice to the ground of appeal, it is necessary to set out significant portions of the evidence, beginning with the answers the complainant gave to Senior Constable Shipway in the recorded interviews. 
     
      
       
      The first interview 
       
      
    28 After some preliminary questions, Senior Constable Shipway asked the complainant about the appellant. She asked firstly, what the complainant liked about the appellant; then about anything she did not like about him. To this she said “that’s easy”. She then said that she did not like his language, because “he swears a lot”; then she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well, what I don’t like about him is his behaviour …” (A 159) 
        
       
      
    29 Asked for more information about this, she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He touches me on the, the rude part whatever …” (A 161) 
        
       
      
    30 Senior Constable Shipway asked for more information about that, to which the complainant replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “… like he touches me on my rude part when my mum isn’t around or when my brother’s around (sic) and that’s it.” (A 164) 
        
       
      
    31 There followed a lengthy part of the interview in which Senior Constable Shipway asked the complainant about what she meant when she referred to “the rude part”. Initially the complainant said she did not know the name of it. Constable Shipway showed her a frontal drawing of a naked female figure and asked her to put a red cross on “the rude part”. The complainant marked the drawing in the area of the vagina, but then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think it’s there, but I don’t know … I’m not quite sure” (A’s 178-179) 
        
       
      
    32 Constable Shipway then asked if the appellant touched her anywhere else. She said that he did. Constable Shipway asked the complainant to mark on the drawing in blue the areas of this touching. The complainant placed two blue crosses on the breast area on the drawing, which she identified as “the boobs”. 
     
      
    33 Constable Shipway then asked more about the red crosses. The complainant said that that was the part of the body used “to do your wee or something”; Constable Shipway asked if she had a name for that place and the complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think it’s called a pussy but I don’t know” (A 200) 
        
       
      
    34 Constable Shipway then asked about what happened when the appellant touched her “pussy”. The complainant replied (I reproduce the answer as transcribed): 
     
      
       
        
        “O.K. First off he opens whatever … the sides. I think it’s called the lips but I don’t know. And then he looks inside at it my, do you know the hole? … whatever that is. I think it’s called a vagina, yeah it’s called a vagina hole … he show me and then he touched me and I said, Don’t touch me there. I told him that I was going to have a bath so I went into the bathroom and he turned the water on, first he put the plug in and then put the water on both of them, the hot and cold. And then he, then I hopped in – the bath. Afterwards I got … I’m remembering. Got it. I went into the bathroom … Yeah, I was in the bathroom. I think it’s called a bathroom. I’m not sure – where the toilet is … I went into the bathroom and then I hopped in where the plug is and the water was … then he opened it again and he looked inside and he said, you know what the round circle is and I said, No, and he told me it was a vagina hole, whatever that is. And after I … because I thought it was cold so I got out, put my top on and I asked mummy if I could watch a DVD …” (A’s 203-208) 
        
       
      
    35 A little later, in answer to a question from Senior Constable Shipway about anything else that the appellant might have said while he was touching her, the complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “He said that, When you get older can I lick it … and I said, No, and he said, Why, and I said, Because you can’t do it now because I’m just a little girl, I’m at (sic) 12 year old, and he said, Well I do it to your mum, and I said, yeah but mum’s not a kid anymore, she’s grown up, and that’s all I said.” (A 259) 
        
       
      
    36 Constable Shipway then asked about any other occasions and the complainant referred to an occasion in her brother’s room when her brother was not present (A 264). She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Well I … was in my brother’s room and I was sitting down and dry my, my legs because my top part was all dry. I putted my top on, I, I was wiping my legs and all those places … and then he came in, [the appellant] came in and said, do you, when I get older do you want to have sex, and I said, No because I might find another man …” (A 268) 
        
       
      
    37 Constable Shipway then asked the complainant if she had told anybody. She said that she had told her mother (A 281). When asked what she had said, the transcript records that she replied: 
     
      
       
        
        “I said, Mum [the appellant] was touching me on my rude part, and then my [sic; “mum” omitted] said to him, You shouldn’t be doing that because you should’ve told me first, she said that to him and that’s it.” (A 282) 
        
       
      
    38 The complainant then said that her mother had told her that she had told the appellant not to do it again, and if he did he would not be coming to their house anymore. When asked about staying overnight at the appellant’s home with her mother, the complainant said that she and her mother went to sleep on the floor there. 
     
      
       
      The second interview (26 April 2007) 
       
      
    39 The second interview also commenced with a number of preliminary questions, in some of which the complainant was reminded of what she had said previously. Constable Shipway then asked about the occasion when, according to the complainant, the appellant had touched her on the breasts. She asked how he did this. The complainant said he did it with one hand, using his finger, which she described as “the rude finger”, adding “which ever that is”. I will set out the ensuing questions and answers in full (as they appear in the transcript provided to the jury): 
     
      
       
        
        “Q94 And how did his rude finger touch your boob?

        A (NO AUDIBLE REPLY) 
         
         
        Q99 Does it look different than another part of your boob? 
         
         
        A No.

        Q108 Ah hmm. Do you know any other names for that part of your boob? 
         
         
        A Uh-uh. 
         
         
        Q109 Was that a yes or a no? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q110 O.K. So, how long did [the appellant] touch the circle part of your boob for? 
         
         
        A One.

        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q116 And what did his rude finger do then? 
         
         
        A Then, oh, I forget the rest. 
         
         
        Q117 You forget? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q118 And you said it was on there for about a minute. 
         
         
        A Yeah, a minute.

        A - - - hard.” (A’s 93-124) 
        
       
      
    40 Constable Shipway then turned to the sexual assault allegation and read part of the complainant’s earlier answers (A’s 203-208 of the first interview). She asked if the description she had there given had been correct. The complainant said that it was. Constable Shipway then asked how the appellant opened the complainant’s vagina hole. The complainant said “With his fingers” (A 133). She said he used two hands. The following is extracted from the transcript of the interview: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q144 O.K. So you said that he used on both his hands, his rude fingers and his index fingers to open up the lips and he showed you, your vagina hole. 
         
         
        A Ah hmm. 
         
         
        Q145 So what part of your vagina hole, or your vagina or the lips, did [the appellant] touch? 
         
         
        A Ah, see the, see when you open the thing and it’s pointy - - - 
         
         
        Q146 Ah hmm. 
         
         
        A - - - that little thing, whatever it’s called. 
         
         
        Q147 Do you know a name for that little thing, that’s pointy? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q148 Mmm 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q149 So, what, what happened with that part? 
         
         
        A He was wiggling it. 
         
         
        Q150 Wiggling it?

        Q152 His thumb? 
         
         
        A Yep, hid (sic) thumb.  
         
         
        Q153 O.K. So you have said that he’s opened the lips. 
         
         
        A Yep. 
         
         
        Q154 And then he’s used his thumb to wiggle - - -

        Q156 Whereabouts is that pointy bit? 
         
         
        A I think it’s in the middle. 
         
         
        Q157 In the middle. What part of your body are we talking about now? 
         
         
        A The bottom part. 
         
         
        Q158 The bottom part. 
         
         
        A Yeah, this part. 
         
         
        Q159 O.K. O.K. So, are we still talking about your vagina?

        Q160 Is that a yes or a no? 
         
         
        A Yep. 
         
         
        Q161 O.K. So, he’s opened up the lips and inside you said that there’s the pointy bit? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q162 And he was using his thumb to wiggle that around? 
         
         
        A Yep. 
         
         
        Q163 O.K. And how long was he doing that for? 
         
         
        A Five minutes. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q165 O.K. And you had also told me that he opened up the lips and he showed you what’s called a vagina hole? 
         
         
        A Yep. 
         
         
        Q166 O.K. So, what parts of your body did he touch when he showed you your vagina hole? 
         
         
        A Um, he touched the vagina hole and then he asked some questions. 
         
         
        Q167 O.K. So, what parts of your vagina hole did he touch? 
         
         
        A Ah, he touched the vagina um, he touched that squiggly thing, whatever you call it. 
         
         
        Q168 Ah hmm. 
         
         
        A Um, he only touched two parts, that’s all I can remember. 
         
         
        Q169 So, those parts of your body, that, that he, the squiggly bit and the vagina hole, are they parts of your body that your undies touch, or are they deeper inside your body? 
         
         
        A I don’t know. 
         
         
        Q170 Mmm, can you think about it? Are they parts that, that the material of your undies would touch? 
         
         
        A. I think so. 
         
         
        Q171. Right, and were [the appellant’s] fingers inside your vagina or on the outside of your vagina? 
         
         
        A Out. 
         
         
        Q172 O.K. And what did you feel when his fingers touched your vagina hole? 
         
         
        A Sore. 
         
         
        Q173 Why was it sore? 
         
         
        A Ah, he, when the lips were closed, right - - -  
         
         
        Q174 Ah hmm. 
         
         
        A - - - he squeezed it. 
         
         
        Q175 Ah hmm. 
         
         
        A Yeah, then - - - 
         
         
        Q176 He squeezed it? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q177 O.K. And when he squeezed it, how did that feel? 
         
         
        A Sore. 
         
         
        Q178 Ah hmm. Why was that sore? 
         
         
        A Ah, he was squeezing it and it felt sore. 
         
         
        Q179 Ah hmm. 
         
         
        A Um - - -  
         
         
        Q180 What did you say when he did that? 
         
         
        A I told him, I told him to stop it. 
         
         
        Q181 Hm. O.K. So you said, his hands or his fingers were on the outside of your vagina hole but you described to me that he’d opened your lips, so, did his fingers touch just the outside of the lips or inside the lips. 
         
         
        A I think it was in, I’m not sure. 
         
         
        Q182 O.K. And what makes you think it could be inside the lips? 
         
         
        A Oh, because he looked inside - - - 
         
         
        Q183 Ah hmm. 
         
         
        A - - - the lips and he said um, I wish I had that part. 
         
         
        Q184 Mmm. And when he touched the squiggly part, inside your vagina - - - 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q184 - - - the middle part, what did that feel like? 
         
         
        A Sore. 
         
         
        Q185 Sore. And why was it sore? 
         
         
        A Only because he like, ah, it was sore because - - - 
         
         
        Q186 Why was it sore, [M…]? 
         
         
        A Because um, he like, err, like um twist it with these two. 
         
         
        Q187 So what fingers there are you pointing too (sic)? 
         
         
        A That one. 
         
         
        Q188 What’s that? 
         
         
        A A thumb and - - - 
         
         
        Q189 Your pointer finger? 
         
         
        A Yep.” 
        
       
      
    41 The complainant gave no additional evidence in chief in the trial. She was cross-examined. 
     
      
    42 I will deal firstly with the cross-examination directed to the actual events the subject of the two charges.  
     
      
    43 Counsel asked the complainant about the allegation she had made in the interview that the appellant had touched her on the breast. The trial transcript records the following exchange: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Do you say that he touched you on the boobs sometime? 
         
         
        A Yes. 
         
         
        Q What do you remember about that? 
         
         
        A I can’t remember. 
         
         
        Q Can you remember where it happened, do you say? 
         
         
        A I think it was in my brother’s room or the bathroom.  
         
         
        Q You’re not sure which of those rooms? 
         
         
        A I’m not sure. 
         
         
        Q Can you remember what you were doing just before that happened? 
         
         
        A I was playing my computer and that was it. Just playing my computer. 
         
         
        Q Where was the computer? 
         
         
        A In my room. 
         
         
        Q Did [the appellant] come into your room? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q Where do you say he touched you – which room were you in, when you say he touched you on the boob? 
         
         
        A Ben’s room. 
         
         
        Q So did you go from your room to Ben’s room? 
         
         
        A Yes. 
         
         
        Q Why did you do that? Can you remember why you did that? 
         
         
        A To play – to watch my cartoons. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q What do you say happened when you say [the appellant] touched you on the boob? 
         
         
        A I can’t remember. 
         
         
        Q Do you say that he touched you with some part of his body on your boobs? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q What do you say, what part of his body do you say. 
         
         
        A His hands. 
         
         
        Q His hands? 
         
         
        A Yes. 
         
         
        Q What do you say he did with his hands? 
         
         
        A I can’t remember. 
         
         
        Q You can’t remember anything about that? 
         
         
        A Nah. 
         
         
        Q You want to have a think about that. 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q It might help if you think about that for a little bit? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q Alright, so it’s just he touched you with his hands, you say, on the boob? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q Did he say anything to you when that was happening? 
         
         
        A I’m not sure. 
         
         
        Q Did you say anything to him when that was happening? 
         
         
        A I’m not sure. 
         
         
        Q Did you say anything to him when that was happening? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q What did you say? 
         
         
        A I told him to stop it. 
         
         
        Q Is that all you said? 
         
         
        A Yeah.” (T pp 28-30) 
        
       
      
    44 A little later counsel asked the complainant what she was wearing when this happened and she said she was wearing “a top”; she then said she was wearing a top and a pair of shorts. But that was immediately followed by her saying that she thought she was wet from having had a bath. 
     
      
    45 Counsel then turned her attention to the allegation of sexual assault (the digital penetration of the vagina). The complainant said that that happened when she was having a bath. Counsel then asked her to recount exactly what it was that the appellant had done. The complainant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I can’t remember that part.” (T p 33) 
        
       
      
    46 She said she was sure she was in the bath, and that the incident was on a different day to the day the appellant touched her on the breast. She could not remember how far apart in time these events occurred. She did, however, say that the vaginal penetration incident occurred before the breast touching incident.  
     
      
    47 On a number of occasions counsel put directly to the complainant that the offences had not occurred. I extract below those questions, although I emphasise that they are not sequential and are drawn from different parts of the transcript. The questions and answers relevant to this issue are: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q I’m saying to you he didn’t touch you on the boob, is that right? 
         
         
        A He – he did. 
         
         
        Q I’m saying to you you’ve made that up, you’ve made up the story about [the appellant] touching you on the boob, is that right? 
         
         
        A I’m not sure. 
         
         
        Q Do you understand what I’m saying to you? 
         
         
        A No.” (T p 40) 
        
       
      
    48 Counsel then prepared a foundation for some further questions by asking the complainant about making up stories as part of her schoolwork. This was done to focus the complainant’s attention on the distinction between a truthful, factual account of events, and a fictional, or fabricated, account. The transcript records the following questions and answers: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q You told us yesterday that, you say that [the appellant] touched you twice, that’s what you say? 
         
         
        A Yep. 
         
         
        Q And you say that he touched you on the boob on one occasion? 
         
         
        A Yep. 
         
         
        Q Is that a made up story? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q Is that something you’ve made up in your head like the stories that you write at school sometimes? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q You’ve also told us that [the appellant] touched you on the pussy you said? 
         
         
        A Yep. 
         
         
        Q Remember saying that, is that a made up story like the stories you write at school sometimes? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q [M…] if you told us that the story about [the appellant] touching you on the boob, if you told us that that was a made up story do you think that you’d get in trouble? 
         
         
        A Yes. 
         
         
        Q And why do you think you’d get in trouble? 
         
         
        A I don’t know. 
         
         
        Q If you told us that the story about [the appellant] touching you on the pussy was a made up story, do you think you’d get in some trouble? 
         
         
        A Yes. 
         
         
        Q That would be changing your story wouldn’t it? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q It would be different to what you said to the police, that’s right? 
         
         
        A Yep. 
         
         
        Q And do you think you’d get in trouble because that would mean changing your story? 
         
         
        A Yep. (T pp 68-69) 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q I’m saying to you that [the appellant] was never in the bathroom when you were in the bath tub, am I right about that? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q Do you understand what I’m asking there? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q I’m saying that there was never a time when you were sitting in the bath tub in your house and [the appellant] was also in the bathroom with you, that’s what I’m saying. Is that right? 
         
         
        A Yeah.” (T p 77) 
        
       
      
    49 Two pages later, the transcript records the following questions and answers: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q [M…] I’m saying that there was never a time that you were in the bath tub at your house and [the appellant] was also in the bathroom, that’s what I’m saying, do you understand that? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q Do you agree with me? 
         
         
        A Yes. 
         
         
        Q Is that how things happened? 
         
         
        A Yes 
         
         
        Q So there was never a time that you were in the bath tub and [the appellant] was in the bathroom with you? 
         
         
        A Yes.” (T p 79) 
        
       
      
    50 There was also cross-examination of the complainant about whether she had told her mother of these incidents, and, if so, what she had said. It will be remembered that, in the first interview (Q 282), Constable Shipway asked if she had told anybody (this was specifically in the context of the allegation about what occurred in the bathroom). The complainant said that she had told her mother. Constable Shipway asked what she had said. The complainant said that she had told her mother that the appellant “was touching me on my rude part”.  
     
      
    51 She also said (in the interview) that her mother had talked to the appellant and told him that if he did it again he would not be coming to the house anymore. 
     
      
    52 The complainant was cross-examined about this. She was asked if she claimed to have talked to her mother about the breast touching incident and she said that she had. She could not remember when she had done so. Nor could she remember what she had said. When asked what her mother had said to her, she said: 
     
      
       
        
        “She said that he couldn’t do that and that she would tell him not to do it again.” (T p 32) 
        
       
       
      She then assented to the proposition that she had “definitely” spoken to her mother about the appellant touching her on the breast.  
       
      
    53 She was then asked whether she talked to her mother after the bathroom incident. She said that she had, and that she had done so on the day after it had happened. She said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I told her and then she said that she’s going to tell him. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        I told her that he touched me again and she wasn’t very happy with that.” (T p 34) 
        
       
       
      She was not sure whether she had told her mother where the appellant had touched her. She did not know whether her mother had asked her any questions, and could not remember anything she said about that conversation. 
       
      
    54 Counsel then asked the complainant this question: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q [Constable Shipway] asked you, ‘when [the appellant] touched you in the bathroom did you tell anybody that time?’ and you said, ‘No’, do you remember that?” (T p 38) 
        
       
       
      The complainant replied “Yeah”.  
       
      
    55 Counsel, before asking the question, identified the question to which she referred as being question 336 in the first interview. The first interview, as presented to the jury, ends at Q292. The question to which counsel referred does not appear in either of the transcripts of interview that were before the jury.  
     
      
    56 It may be that that question appears in what may have been able to be made out of the tape described as having been inaudible. In any event, it must have been confusing, both for the jury and for the complainant. 
     
      
    57 The cross-examination then continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Can you remember why you said that? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q Because you’re telling us today that you told your mum about [the appellant] touching you in the bathroom. That’s what you say? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q One of the things you said to [Constable Shipway] is that you didn’t tell anybody about that? Can you see that they are two different stories? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q And the story you’re telling us today, you say that you told your mum about what happened in the bathroom, that’s right? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q One of the things you told [Constable Shipway], was that you didn’t tell anybody about what happened in the bathtub? 
         
         
        A (NO VERBAL REPLY) 
         
         
        Q Do you understand that? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Q You didn’t talk to your mum about – you didn’t say to your mum, ‘[the appellant’s] touched me in the bathroom on the pussy’, did you? You just didn’t do that? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q Do you understand what I’m asking you? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q I’m saying to you that you did not talk to your mum about [the appellant] touching you on the pussy? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q Am I right about that? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q You tell us today that [the appellant] touched you on the boob, that’s what you say? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q And you also tell us today that you talked to your mum about that afterwards. Is that what you say? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q Do you understand what I’m asking? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q I’m saying to you you didn’t talk to your mum about [the appellant] touching you on the boob, is that right? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q You sure you understand what I’m asking you? 
         
         
        A (NO VERBAL REPLY) 
         
         
        Q If you’re a bit confused just tell me. Are you a bit confused? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q I’m saying you didn’t – you just didn’t talk to your mum? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q You didn’t say to your mum, ‘[the appellant] touched me on the boob’? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q I’m saying to you he didn’t touch you on the boob, is that right? 
         
         
        A He - he did.” (T pp 39-40) 
        
       
      
    58 LA’s evidence was quite different. In her evidence in chief she was asked, in general terms, about being told anything by the complainant in 2006. Her attention was directed to the allegations against the appellant. The only thing she recounted the complainant having said to her was: 
     
      
       
        
        “A Yeah [the complainant said] that [the appellant] wanted to lick her out.” 
        
       
      
    59 In cross-examination she was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “… she certainly didn’t come to you and say that [the appellant] had touched her on the vagina, she didn’t say to you that [the appellant] touched her on the breast or boob?” 
        
       
       
      She answered: 
       
       
        
        “No.” 
        
       
      
    60 There is another sequence in the cross-examination to which it is necessary to make reference. 
     
      
    61 Counsel quoted a question asked by Constable Shipway in the first interview, and the answer there given by the complainant. The question concerned the last time the appellant had been in the complainant’s house. The answer she gave was: 
     
      
       
        
        “Probably last – I think it was two weeks ago. I’m not sure. I’m just guessing. Like I have always …” (A 232) 
        
       
      
    62 In cross-examination the complainant agreed that she had said that, and that she had heard that when the tape recording was played to the jury. Counsel then asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Is that one of the things that you were guessing?” 
        
       
      
    63 Presumably, what counsel was referring to by “that” was the last time the appellant had been at the complainant’s house. The complainant replied “Yeah”. The next questions and answers are put forward as of considerable significance. They are: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Were you guessing about what happened in the bath tub when you say [the appellant] touched you? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q Were you guessing a bit about what happened in the bedroom when you say [the appellant] touched you on the boob? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q Were you guessing because you weren’t sure what happened in the bedroom? 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q Do you understand what guessing is? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q What do you think the word guessing means? 
         
         
        A Um – um I don’t know.” (T pp 35-36) 
        
       
      
    64 Counsel then asked a number of questions about the meaning of “guessing”. The complainant (to my mind, not surprisingly) was unable to give a definition. 
     
      
    65 Finally, it is necessary to refer to some questions directed to the complainant’s credibility.  
     
      
    66 In one sequence of questions it was put to her that she had made up the stories of the two incidents. On each occasion she denied that proposition. 
     
      
    67 She was then asked some questions suggesting to her that she was aware that if she admitted that the account she had given was false she would be “in trouble”. She agreed that she did think that admitting that she had made up the stories would mean she would be “in trouble”, but was not able to say why. This was a somewhat recurring theme in the cross-examination. It is unnecessary here to reproduce all of the questions and answers; I will provide some examples at a later point in these reasons. 
     
      
    68 The complainant was then asked about her attitude to the appellant, and agreed that she did not really like him. She assented to a question which suggested that she wanted him to “go away” and to stop seeing her mother. It is, however, convenient to reproduce one further small passage of transcript: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q Did you make up the story about [the appellant] touching you because you wanted him to go away? 
         
         
        A Yes. 
         
         
        Q I’m sorry what did you say? I’ll ask you again [M …] 
         
         
        A Yeah. 
         
         
        Q Did you make up the story about [the appellant] touching you because you wanted [the appellant] to go away? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q You sure? 
         
         
        A Yeah.” (T pp 79-80) 
        
       
       
      The argument on appeal 
       
      
    69 In support of the appeal, counsel for the appellant drew attention to three specific aspects of the complainant’s evidence. These were: 
     
      
       
       her evidence about the incident alleged to have taken place in the bathroom; 
       
       
       her evidence about “guessing” (T pp 35-36); 
       
       
       her evidence about complaint to her mother. 
       
      
    70 As to the first of these it was submitted that: 
     
      
       
        
        “On the complainant’s own account the incident comprising Count 2 on the indictment could not have occurred.” 
        
       
      
    71 In support of this, reliance was placed upon what was described as the complainant’s “unequivocal” evidence that there was never a time when she was in the bath tub at her house while the appellant was also in the bathroom. Those questions and answers are extracted above, from T pp 77 and 79.  
     
      
    72 I explain below why it is that little weight can be attached to the complainant’s evidence in response to questions framed as were those which prompted these answers. 
     
      
    73 As to the second point, I would similarly place no weight upon the complainant’s inability to define “guessing”. Indeed, the word is so well understood that an adult might have difficulty in providing a definition. Nor, again for reasons explained below, would I accept at face value the affirmative answers to questions about whether she was “guessing” when she described the two incidents. In relation to those descriptions, the concept of “guessing” is inapt; either the incidents occurred or they did not; the complainant was either right or wrong in her description; but she could not have “guessed” them. Perhaps it was the disconnect between the concept of “guessing” and the relating of events that she said happened that caused the complainant to respond as she did. Whatever the explanation, I am quite satisfied that her assent to the proposition does not undermine her direct evidence about those events. 
     
      
    74 The conflict in the evidence concerning complaint to the complainant’s mother might appear to be of more significance. However, the complainant’s mother gave evidence that she was in receipt of a disability pension because: 
     
      
       
        
        “I’m sort of on the borderline of not understanding.” (T 25/2/08 p 7) 
        
       
       
      and that she had been told that she had “a borderline intellectual impairment”. 
       
      
    75 The Crown did not, as I understand the way it presented its case, advance what the complainant claimed, in the interview, to have told her mother as evidence of complaint as it is understood in prosecution of sexual offences. It did not call evidence from LA of complaint, and did not rely on the complainant’s answers to questions 281 and 282 in that way. The issue really emerged in cross-examination, in relation to the complainant’s credibility. Complaint was not a major issue in this case, although I acknowledge that the conflict is relevant to the assessment of the complainant’s credibility. It was, of course, fully before the jury. I do not discount it in the assessment of the reliability of the verdicts. 
     
      
    76 It is clear that questions of any degree of complexity were beyond the capacity of the complainant to comprehend. It is equally clear that, on many occasions, she gave answers (usually affirming the substance of what was put to her) to questions she did not fully understand. The questions about “guessing” to which I have already referred are illustrative. Two further illustrations will suffice. They are: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q I’m saying to you, you don’t want to tell us that you made it up because you think you’re going to get in trouble, is that right? 
         
         
        A Yes. 
         
         
        Q Do you understand what I’m saying? 
         
         
        A No.” (T p 71) 
        
       
       
      and: 
       
       
        
        “Q [M…] what I’m saying to you is this. I’m saying to you that the story about [the appellant] touching you on the boob, that you’ve made that up but you can’t tell us you’ve made it up, because you think you’ll get into trouble. Am I right about that? 
         
         
        A Yes.” (T p 73) 
        
       
      
    77 Each of these questions contained at least four concepts:  
     
      
       
      (i) “I’m saying to you …”; 
       
       
      (ii) “you’ve made it up …”; 
       
       
      (iii) “because you think you’ll get into trouble …”; 
       
       
      (iv) “Is that right?”/“Am I right about that?” 
       
      
    78 What did the complainant understand “that” in (iv) to refer to? The possibilities are: 
     
      
       
      “I’m saying to you”? (Yes, counsel was saying something to the complainant – the affirmative answer was correct); 
       
       
      “you’ve made it up”?; 
       
       
      “… you think you’ll get into trouble …”? (the complainant had agreed that she thought, if she had made up the story, she would be in trouble. The affirmative answer was correct.) 
       
      
    79 One could not be confident that her affirmative answers represented assent to all components of the complex composite propositions that were put to her.  
     
      
    80 But when questions were simplified and direct, her responses were different, and equally direct. For example, she was asked: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q And you say that he touched you on the boob on one occasion? 
         
         
        A Yep. 
         
         
        Q Is that a made up story? 
         
         
        A No. 
         
         
        Q Is that something you’ve made up in your head like the stories that you write at school sometimes? 
         
         
        A No.” (T p 68) 
        
       
       
      and: 
       
       
        
        “Q [M…] what I’m saying to you is that the story about [the appellant] touching you on the boob, I’m saying you made that up, is that right, am I right about that?  
        Did you make up the story about [the appellant] touching you on the boob 
        ? 
         
         
        A No.” (T p 74, italics added) 
        
       
      
    81 Contrast this latter question and answer with those which immediately followed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q I’m saying to you that you can’t tell us that you made up that story because you think you’re going to get in trouble, am I right about that? 
         
         
        A Yes.”  
        
       
      
    82 In making these observations about the way questions were framed I do not intend any criticism of counsel. She, to her credit, did not attempt to exploit the situation, and she appears to have attempted to frame her questions as simply as possible. But her strategy (of suggesting that the complainant had, in effect, painted herself into a corner with a fabricated story because she wanted the appellant out of her life, and that, having done so, she feared the consequences of confession of her misdeed) called for complex ideas to be put to the complainant. It was when this was done that the answers, which appear to favour the appellant, become unreliable.  
     
      
    83 Of course, it is not the function of this Court to construe the complainant’s answers, or evaluate her credibility. That lies in the realm of the jury. Because of the difficulties in eliciting evidence from the complainant, their evaluation was critical. Unlike this Court, they had the advantage of observing the complainant. In this case that advantage was more than usually significant.  
     
      
    84 And the course of the trial shows that the jury went about their task with considerable care. Their deliberations occupied (assuming normal court hours were kept) 4 hours and 40 minutes. This is a not insignificant length of time, when one considers that, although her evidence was given over two consecutive days and was interrupted for a fairly lengthy legal argument, the complainant’s cross-examination is recorded in only 29 pages of transcript. 
     
      
    85 Further, the jury at an early stage asked two pertinent questions, indicating that they were alive to the issues they had to decide.  
     
      
    86 I am satisfied that the verdicts of guilty were well open to the jury. I do not experience any doubt about the appellant’s guilt which ought to have been shared by the jury.  
     
      
    87 I propose that the appeal against conviction be dismissed.  
     
      
    88 R A HULME J: I agree with Simpson J.

    JUDGMENT1. Mr Patrick, the Crown Prosecutor in these proceedings against Mr Tony McLeod on a charge of assault occasioning grievous bodily harm in company, tenders two police statements. I have marked them VDA and VDB. Each statement concerns the behaviour and state of intoxication of the accused within 15 minutes, or so, before the assault which the prosecution alleges was perpetrated by Mr Tony McLeod with others.2. There is evidence already in the proceedings from which the jury would be able to infer that Mr McLeod was intoxicated at the relevant time. 3. Mr I Todd who appears for Mr Tony McLeod objects to the evidence on two grounds. The first is under s 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 where he asks me to refuse to admit the evidence because its probative value is outweighed by the danger and unfair prejudice to his client. A second basis is a general refusal to admit evidence which is provided for by s 135 of the Evidence Act.4. Mr Patrick argues that the evidence contained in the two statements point to the state of mind of the accused and to his state of intoxication shortly before the alleged assault, or rather shortly before the assault in which it is alleged the accused participated. 5. Mr Todd argues that the evidence concerning the level of intoxication is evidence from which the jury may be able to infer or would be asked to infer that his client was in a disinhibited state and more likely to behave violently. He points out that there is evidence available to him and to the Crown to the effect that his client at the hotel - to which the police were called who gave statements which are tendered by Mr Patrick - behaved in a way where he was trying to subdue a potentially violent situation.6. Mr Todd points out that he would need to consider asking the Crown to lead such evidence or to lead such evidence himself. Such evidence may be, he said, controversial. He also points out that a further prejudice is an inference which the jury may draw that the reason for the police being called to the hotel was connected with the behaviour of his client and his companions. That inference, I am informed, would be substantially correct. Nevertheless Mr Patrick would attempt to lead the evidence in a way which would not include a reference to that connection. Mr Todd also points out that the statements contain evidence about his client and companions behaving in a boisterous manner.7. I propose to refuse to admit the evidence in its entirety. The first reason is that there is in my opinion a danger of unfair prejudice to Mr Tony McLeod in this evidence being led. I think it would be difficult to avoid the jury inferring that there may be some connection between the police attending the hotel and the behaviour of Mr Tony McLeod and his companions. The second reason is that they may well infer or draw a similar inference from the observations made by the police. 8. One answer to that unfair prejudice is, as Mr Todd suggested, the leading of evidence concerning his client's behaviour at the hotel. That to my mind would result in what s 135 calls ""an undue waste of time"".9. I do not say that by way of criticism of either party. I say it in this context. The issues in this case, because of the competence of both counsel, have been clear and readily identifiable. It focuses on the behaviour of the accused at a particular point of time. The jury have a good deal of evidence, including CCTV footage and witnesses about his behaviour at that time. The trial, in my opinion, is one which should focus on the evidence at that particular stage. To my mind venturing into collateral evidence about his behaviour a short time beforehand, which is itself controversial - namely whether he was behaving in a boisterous and drunken way so as to attract the police or whether he was behaving as a peacemaker - would given, the issues in this trial, result in an undue waste of time.10. For those reasons and relying on both s 137 and 135 of the Evidence Act, I refuse to admit the evidence which would be given consistent with VDA and VDB.

    3 HARRISON J: The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentences imposed upon him in the District Court on 28 August 2009 by Berman DCJ. He was sentenced to an aggregate sentence of 3 years imprisonment comprised of a non-parole period of 18 months and a balance of term of 18 months. His non-parole period is due to expire on 15 April 2010, so that disposition of this appeal is attended by some urgency. The applicant was unrepresented at the hearing in this Court. He filed detailed written submissions to which I have had regard. However, in the events that I will shortly describe, it is my opinion that the application is wholly without merit and that the appeal should be dismissed.  
     
      
    Background 
     
      
    4 The applicant was arrested and charged with all offences on 16 October 2008. He has been in custody since that time. He entered pleas of guilty at the Central Local Court on 9 July 2009 to the following six offences: 
     
      
      Count 1 
      : Obtain property by deception contrary to s 178BA(1) of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900 (4 plasma television sets $7906). 
       
       
      Count 2 
      : Obtain property by deception contrary to s 178BA(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
        
      (De Lorenzo hair products valued at $8636.75). 
       
       
      Count 3 
      : Obtain property by deception contrary to s 178BA(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
        
      (air travel tickets $9036.49). 
       
       
      Count 4 
      : Obtain property by deception contrary to s 178BA(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
        
      (air travel tickets $4953.88). 
       
       
      Count 5 
      : Obtain property by deception contrary to s 178BA(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
        
      (receive finance for vehicle $65,746.10). 
       
       
      Count 6 
      : Obtain property by deception contrary to s 178BA(1) of the  
      Crimes Act 
        
      (receive finance for vehicle $82,759.10). 
       
      
    5 The offence of obtain property by deception under s 178BA carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. 
     
      
    6 In addition the applicant admitted having committed 34 offences that were taken into account on three separate Form 1s in the following manner: 
     
      
      Count 1 
       - a Form 1 containing two further offences of obtain property by deception. 
       
       
      Count 2 
       - a Form 1 containing one count of make a false instrument, one count of use a false instrument and one count of obtain property by deception. 
       
       
      Count 6 
       - a Form 1 containing two counts of have false instrument, one count of larceny, twenty-five counts of obtain property by deception and one count of receiving. 
       
      
    7 His Honour sentenced the applicant in the following way: 
     
      
      Count 1 
      : a fixed term of 1 year imprisonment to date from 16 October 2008 and to expire on 15 October 2009 (to be served concurrently with the sentences imposed for counts 3, 4 and 5). 
       
       
      Count 2 
      : a fixed term of 1 year imprisonment to date from 16 April 2009 and to expire on 15 April 2010. 
       
       
      Count 3 
      : a fixed term of 1 year imprisonment to date from 16 October 2008 and to expire on 15 October 2009 (to be served concurrently with the sentences imposed for counts 1, 4 and 5). 
       
       
      Count 4 
      : a fixed term of 1 year imprisonment to date from 16 October 2008 and to expire on 15 October 2009 (to be served concurrently with the sentences imposed for counts 1, 3 and 5). 
       
       
      Count 5 
      : a fixed term of 1 year imprisonment to date from 16 October 2008 and to expire on 15 October 2009 (to be served concurrently with the sentences imposed for counts 1, 3 and 4). 
       
       
      Count 6 
      : 2 years imprisonment to date from 16 October 2009 and to expire on 15 October 2011 with a non-parole period of 6 months to date from 16 October 2009 and to expire on 15 April 2010. 
       
      
    Facts 
     
      
    8 The agreed facts disclose that the offences were committed between March 2007 and March 2008. The offences were investigated by three different groups of police officers. Three separate statements of agreed facts were tendered during the sentence proceedings. 9 The first set of offences (count 1 and two matters on a Form 1) involved the applicant, during February and March 2008, arranging for the order and delivery of four 42 inch plasma television sets using details of credit cards he did not have authority to use. The matters on the Form 1 involved the applicant obtaining a further two television sets and a laptop computer in the same manner. 
     
      
    10 The second set of offences (count 2 and three matters on a Form 1) involved the applicant arranging for the purchase of and obtaining various hair products from De Lorenzo Hair and Cosmetic Research Pty Ltd. These offences took place in August 2007. The applicant falsely represented himself to be 'Fabian Ranogajer' and that he ran a salon in Leichhardt called 'Empire Hair'. He applied for and obtained a credit account with the supplier using false information. On 17 August 2007 the applicant placed an order and obtained $7526.30 worth of hair products. On 28 August 2007 he contacted the supplier (using the name 'Giovanni' from 'Empire Hair') and paid for the previous order using details of a credit card that he was not authorised to use. He also placed an order for a further $8636.75 worth of goods. The applicant attended the warehouse of the supplier and obtained these goods. The following day he placed a further order for $2550.75 worth of goods but asked if he could pay $2000 then and the balance at a later date. The applicant used details of the same credit card he had used earlier. He did not however collect these goods. 
     
      
    11 On 31 August 2007, another customer contacted the supplier and complained of a number of unauthorised payments that had been deducted from his credit card in favour of the supplier. The supplier ascertained that the credit card number in question corresponded with the details of the credit card provided by the applicant. The supplier suffered a loss of $18,163.05. During the course of the investigation into these offences, the applicant declined to take part in a line up in relation to the offence. He also declined to take part in a record of interview. 
     
      
    12 The third set of offences (counts 3, 4, 5 & 6, along with 29 matters on a Form 1) involve criminal conduct that spanned the period from May 2007 to December 2007. On 18 May 2007 the applicant booked accommodation over the internet using the name 'John Ranogajec' and a stolen credit card. Police were subsequently contacted and a search warrant was executed at the hotel room occupied by the applicant at the time. A number of items were seized, including 13 credit cards, banking information, diaries containing various credit card details and expiry dates, a German drivers licence with a photograph of the applicant along with a Medicare card and false Australian citizenship certificate all in the name of 'Mome Donevski'. There were also an eftpos card and credit card receipts from the Terrigal Flight Centre. 
     
      
    13 The applicant was arrested and conveyed to Gosford Police Station. He agreed to be electronically interviewed and provided various explanations. He was released, without charge, pending further investigation and inquiries. 
     
      
    14 Those investigations subsequently disclosed that the Medicare card in the name of Mome Donevski was a genuine card that had been reported stolen in February 2007. Both the German drivers licence bearing the name of Mome Donevski (which bore a recent photograph of the applicant) and the Australian citizenship certificate in the same name were high quality forgeries that contained several security features. 
     
      
    15 On 4 April 2007 the applicant used credit card details he was not authorised to use to obtain plane tickets over the internet with Qantas worth $4953.88. On 8 April 2007 the applicant used credit card details he was not authorised to use to obtain plane tickets from the Terrigal Flight Centre to the value of $9036.49. 
     
      
    16 On 18 June 2007 the applicant opened a bank account at a Westpac branch in Hobart, Tasmania in the name of Johny Fabian Ranogajec. A false Citizenship Certificate was used by the applicant to open this account. The applicant subsequently made an application for a personal loan in the amount of $59,500 in order to purchase a new motor vehicle worth $41,500 and for $18,000 to be credited to his account. In support of his application he provided false employment details. The bank subsequently provided the applicant with a bank cheque for $41,500 made out to 'Larke Hoskins Honda' and credited his account with $18,000. On 5 October 2007, using an alias, the applicant registered a company with the Australian Securities & Investment Commission in the name of 'Honda Larke Hoskins Pty Ltd'. He then opened another bank account at ANZ Bank, Bathurst Street Branch, in the name of 'Honda Larke Hoskins Pty Ltd'. He deposited the cheque for $41,500 into this account and completely withdrew the proceeds in varying amounts of less than $10,000 over the following days. 
     
      
    17 On 20 November 2007 the applicant opened a bank account in the name of 'Jon Mason' at the King and Castlereagh Streets branch of Westpac. At the time, according to records kept by the Registry of Births Deaths and Marriages, 'Jon Mason' was the applicant's legal name though he was also using the name 'Johny Fabian Ranogajec'. 
     
      
    18 On 18 December 2007 the applicant made an application for a personal loan in order to purchase a new 2007 Audi A4 motor vehicle for $54,750 and for a further $20,250 to be credited to his account. In support of the loan application the applicant provided false employment details. These details involved an assertion that he was employed as specialist manager by a company called 'Oceana Trade' and that he earned a monthly net income of $3,618. The applicant arranged for two payments to be made to his account in early December with the narrative 'Oceana Pay'. Further investigations revealed that a company by the name of 'Oceana Trade' was registered on 27 November 2007 by the applicant using the alias Johny Fabian Ranogajec. 
     
      
    19 On 21 December 2007 the applicant obtained a bank cheque for $54,750 made out to Audi Centre, Sydney and had the amount of $20,250 credited to his account. That same day the applicant registered a company with ASIC in the name of 'Audi Centre Sydney NSW Pty Ltd'. He then attended the St George Bank (Pitt and Market Street Branch) and opened a bank account in the name of 'Audi Centre Sydney NSW Pty Ltd'. He deposited the cheque for $54,750 into that account and proceeded to withdraw the amount in various amounts over the following days. 
     
      
    20 The matters on the Form 1 that relate to count 6 involve the applicant obtaining various other goods and services using credit card details that he was not authorised to use. 
     
      
    21 The applicant declined to take part in an ERISP in respect to these matters. 
     
      
    Grounds of appeal 
     
      
    22 There are effectively four grounds of appeal numbered by the applicant as follows: 
     
      
      Ground 1(a) 
      : The judge erred in not imposing entirely concurrent sentences. 
       
       
      Ground 1(b) 
      : The judge erred in allowing only 40 per cent by way of a combined discount for guilty plea, remorse and assistance to the authorities. 
       
       
      Ground 2 
      : The judge erred in proceeding to sentence on the basis of the three statements of agreed facts. 
       
       
      Ground 3 
      : The sentence imposed is manifestly excessive – the discount for assisting police was arbitrarily selected without proper regard to the value of that assistance. 
       
      
    Ground 3 
     
      
    23 This ground of appeal can conveniently be dealt with first. It is important at the outset to record that the applicant was engaged in an extensive and sophisticated series of criminal acts. They were neither spontaneous nor opportunistic but on the contrary premeditated, well planned and exquisitely calculated to effect a criminal purpose. The applicant committed some of the offences whilst on bail. The face value of the property and money involved in all of the offences amounted to almost $270,000 ($269,726). 
     
      
    24 The aggregate effect of the sentences imposed for all of these 40 offences was a non-parole period of imprisonment of 18 months commencing on 15 October 2008 and expiring on15 April 2010. Putting aside for the moment the first three grounds of appeal, I consider that these sentences are not only not manifestly excessive but on the contrary approach what might be regarded as manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    25 His Honour characterised the offending and his view of the applicant in the following passage from his remarks on sentence: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The prospects for the offender's future, as far as re-offending is concerned, are good. I consider that he is unlikely to re-offend. It remains the case, despite all the positive things that I have said about the offender, however, that he was a serious criminal for that year long period. He was using other people's money for his own purposes. He was living a lifestyle he could not afford and that included the taking of drugs. He chose to continue that lifestyle through harming others in a financial way. His regular decisions to fund his lifestyle through criminal misconduct must require that the offender receives a significant custodial sentence. It would of course be a much longer sentence in the absence of the matters I have referred to."" 
        
       
      
    26 It is unnecessary and inappropriate to speculate upon the issue of the applicant's prospects of re-offending. His Honour had the benefit of helpful submissions on the issue as well as the opportunity to observe the applicant giving evidence. Limiting these observations to an analysis of the several offences charged, it is difficult to accept that an effective non-parole period of only 18 months adequately reflects the objective seriousness of the offences. Accepting that his Honour in some fashion formulated the sentences so as to give the applicant a combined discount for his early plea of guilty and his assistance to authorities of 40 per cent, I do not even so consider that the sentences can be described as manifestly excessive or anything like it. 
     
      
    27 This is sufficient to dispose of ground 3. 
     
      
    Ground 1(a) 
     
      
    28 This ground of appeal is conspicuously without any merit. As will be apparent, his Honour was called upon to sentence the applicant for six separate counts with a further 34 matters to be taken into account. The sentences imposed for counts 1, 3, 4 and 5 were wholly concurrent. The sentence for count 2 was partly accumulated with these four counts. The sentence for count 6 was wholly accumulated with all other sentences. 
     
      
    29 The extent of any accumulation is a matter of discretion for the sentencing judge. In R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115, the principles were outlined at [52] by Hall J as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[52] There is no general rule that determines whether sentences ought to be imposed concurrently or consecutively: see  
        Cahyadi v Regina 
         (2007) 168 A Crim R 41 per Howie J at 47. However, a number of propositions relevant to the consideration of that issue may be derived from the case law. They include the following:-  
         
          
           
          (1) It is well established that questions of accumulation are, subject to the application of established principle, discretionary. What is important is that, firstly, an appropriate sentence is imposed in respect of each offence; and, secondly, that the total sentence imposed properly reflects the totality of the criminality:  
          Regina v Wilson  
          [2005] NSWCCA 219 at [38] per Simpson, Barr and Latham JJ agreeing. 
           
           
          (2) In  
          Regina v Weldon; Regina v Carberry 
           (2002) 136 A Crim R 55, Ipp JA at [48] stated that it is  
          'not infrequent that, where the offences arise out of one criminal enterprise, concurrent sentences will be imposed' 
           but his Honour observed that  
          'this is not an inflexible rule' 
           and ' 
          [t]he practice should not be followed where wholly concurrent sentences would fail to take account of differences in conduct' 
          . 
           
           
          (3) The question as to whether sentences in respect of two or more offences committed in the course of a single episode or a criminal enterprise or on a particular day should be concurrent or at least partly accumulated is to be determined by the principle of totality and the relevant factors to be taken into account in the application of that principle. See observations in this respect of Howie J in  
          Nguyen v Regina  
          [2007] NSWCCA 14 at [12]. 
           
           
          (4) In applying the principle of totality, the question to be posed is whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other offence. See generally  
          Regina v MMK 
           [2006] NSWCCA 272 at [11] and [13],  
          Cahyadi  
          (supra) at [12] and [27] and  
          Vaovasa v Regina  
          [2007] NSWCCA 253. 
           
           
          (5) If the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other, then the sentences ought to be concurrent, otherwise there is a risk that the combined sentences will exceed that which is warranted to reflect the totality of the two offences:  
          Cayhadi 
           (supra) per Howie J at [27]. 
           
           
          (6) If not, the sentence should be at least partially cumulative otherwise there is a risk that the total sentence will fail to reflect the total criminality of the two offences. This is so regardless of whether the two offences represent two discrete acts of criminality or can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality:  
          Cayhadi 
           (supra) per Howie J at [27]. 
           
           
          (7) Whether the sentence for one offence can comprehend and reflect the criminality of the other calls for the identification and an evaluation of relevant factors pertaining to the offences. These will include the nature and seriousness of each offence'."" 
          
         
        
       
      
    30 The offences were separate and distinct. There were also separate victims. They were committed at different times over a 12-month period. The sentences for each offence ought necessarily to have reflected these facts. It could be argued that they did not. If anything, the extent of his Honour's accumulation of the sentences in this case was considerably more favourable to the applicant than it was unfavourable. 
     
      
    31 The applicant has not demonstrated any error in the approach taken by his Honour and certainly not an error that would lead this Court to intervene in his favour. 
     
      
    Ground 1(b) 
     
      
    32 This Court has dealt with this issue in a number of well-known cases. One of those is S v R [2008] NSWCCA 186 in which Bell JA said the following at [9]: 
     
      
       
        
        ""[9 Section 23 of the  
        Sentencing Procedure Act 
         permits a court to impose a lesser penalty than it would otherwise impose having regard to the degree to which the offender has assisted (or undertaken to assist) law enforcement authorities in relation to the offence concerned or any other offence. A lesser penalty imposed under s 23(1) must not be unreasonably disproportionate to the nature and circumstances of the offence (s 23(3)). As Howie J (with whose reasons Simpson J agreed) pointed out in  
        SZ v R 
         [2007] NSWCCA 19; 168 A Crim R 249, there is a limit to the extent to which an otherwise appropriate sentence can be discounted and yet still produce a sentence that is not unreasonably disproportionate to the offence. Commonly, an offender who undertakes to assist the authorities (either in the investigation of the offence or other offences) will plead guilty at an early time and thus be entitled to a discount at the top of the range promulgated in the guideline judgment:  
        R v Thomson and Houlton 
         [2000] NSWCCA 309; 49 NSWLR 383. In such a case there will necessarily be less room to discount the sentence in order to reflect the offender's assistance to the authorities without infringing the command of s 23(3) of the  
        Sentencing Procedure Act 
        ."" 
        
       
      
    33 His Honour dealt with the matter upon the basis of material contained in a sealed envelope that has not be shown to this Court. His Honour's remarks on sentence are relevantly as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""I am going to say very little about a matter that is significantly in the offender's favour. The evidence is in a sealed envelope and it reveals the extent to which the offender is prepared to assist the authorities and has assisted the authorities. Not only will I be circumspect about what I can say but these remarks on sentence will, contrary to my usual practice, not be published on the internet. 
         
         
        As well as demonstrating the genuineness of his remorse the assistance is deserving of a discount on the sentence that I would have imposed. I will not assess it separately from the discount that the offender will get for pleading guilty at the earliest opportunity but will say that the sentence I will impose upon the offender will be forty percent less than it would have been had there not been the plea of guilty and assistance. 
         
         
        There is an element of uncertainty about just what the offender will do to assist the authorities. It is not the offender's fault. It is because matters are still at an unsettled stage. It might turn out to be that the offender does something which would have suggested a discount higher than forty percent but I have to assess matters as they are today. 
         
         
        One of the consequences for the offender is that he is now in protective custody. The conditions under which he is now kept in his cell for between twenty-one and twenty-three hours a day are much different to the conditions he previously enjoyed as a reception sweeper. I will take this matter firmly into account in assessing the appropriate sentence. It has also been taken into account in determining the level of discount for assistance that I mentioned earlier."" 
        
       
      
    34 His Honour was not required to assess or quantify the value of the plea of guilty separately from the allowance to be made for assistance: SZ v The Queen [2007] NSWCCA 19 at [11], [42] – [48]; (2007) 168 A Crim R 249. 
     
      
    35 His Honour's decision to allow the discount was an exercise in discretion: MAJW v R [2009] NSWCCA 255 at [60]. No error in his Honour's approach to this task can be seen. His decision to allow a discount of 40 per cent was well within the appropriate range available to him.  
     
      
    36 This ground of appeal fails. 
     
      
    Ground 2 
     
      
    37 The representatives of the Crown and the applicant settled what amounted to the agreed facts tendered on sentence. None was the subject of any dispute. There was no uncertainty as to what the parties had agreed, nor was there any dispute about the essential factual substratum of the applicant's criminal conduct: cf Della-Vedova v R [2009] NSWCCA 107. 
     
      
    38 The passage from his Honour's remarks on sentence which would appear to have inspired this ground of appeal is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        ""Working out precisely what the offender did has not been easy in the present case. It seems that there were three different groups of police investigating the offender's various misconduct. That has led to the matter being presented in court by the DPP today almost as though the three matters are unrelated to each other. I can quite understand why the three different groups of police would for example, prepare three different statements of facts, but why it remained in that state when it was presented to the court today is inexplicable. I mean no criticism of the solicitor appearing for the DPP today, I suspect that it is not her fault that she was given this material late but I do want to say that it is those who prepared the matter for court who showed an inability or an unwillingness to assist the court to the extent that I consider it disrespectful when matters are presented in the way they were presented today. The DPP has once again acted merely as a courier service, taking documents given to them by police, maybe changing one or two things here and there and then presenting them to the court. The court deserves better. 
         
         
        However, with that disclaimer it seems that the offender's conduct began on 28 March 2007 …"" 
        
       
      
    39 It seems apparent that the sentencing proceedings were complicated by the large number of offences committed by the applicant over the course of a year. His Honour's criticisms were directed to the presentation of the case. He did not say that he was unable, albeit with more effort than should have been necessary, to master the facts and work out precisely what was alleged. He did not say that he was unable to deal with the matter appropriately. 
     
      
    40 There is no error that the applicant can point to in the approach taken by his Honour in the circumstances. 
     
      
    Conclusion 
     
      
    41 As I earlier observed, the applicant is unrepresented. I have made an allowance for that fact in considering the grounds of appeal. However, none of the grounds of appeal has merit and the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      
    Orders 
     
      
    42 I consider that the following orders should be made: 
     
      
      1. Grant leave to appeal. 
       
       
      2. Appeal dismissed.

    IN THE COURT OFCRIMINAL APPEAL CCA 2007/15155 DC 2007/11/0697 GILES JA R S HULME J LATHAM J THURSDAY 4 MARCH 2010 
     
     Tony PULITANO v R 
     
     
     JUDGMENT 
    1 GILES JA: In 1999 the applicant was committed for trial on charges arising from events on 1 December 1998, in which he drove a stolen car at police who were attempting to detain it and its occupants. He was in custody from his arrest on 16 December 1998 until granted bail on 7 April 1999.  
     
      
    2 The applicant absconded prior to trial. In 2007 he voluntarily handed himself in to the police. He thereafter pleaded guilty to three charges arising from the events of 1 December 1998, although perhaps not precisely those on which he had been committed for trial. They were driving a stolen car; assaulting police officers with intent to prevent the apprehension of himself and two other persons; and resisting police officers in executing their duty. 
     
      
    3 On 2 May 2008 Berman DCJ sentenced the applicant to imprisonment for eighteen months for each of the offences, implicitly as concurrent sentences, but suspended the sentences on condition of entry into a good behaviour bond for eighteen months. His Honour did not specify non-parole periods.  
     
      
    4 Thereafter the applicant breached the conditions of the bond, in that he failed to accept the supervision of the Probation and Parole Service and failed to notify that Service of his change of address. He was taken into custody on 27 July 2009, and in due course came before Berman DCJ.  
     
      
    5 On 9 October 2009 Berman DCJ revoked the order suspending the sentences. It may be that the correct order should have been revocation of the bonds, with the order suspending their sentences then ceasing to have effect pursuant to s 99(1)(c) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, but no point is taken as to the formulation of the order. His Honour continued - 
     
      
       
        
        “The offender is sentenced therefore to imprisonment for eighteen months. The non-parole period is nine months. It will have commenced on 27 July 2009 and will thus expire on 26 April 2010...” 
        
       
      
    6 The applicant seeks leave to appeal against sentence, on the ground that his Honour erred in failing to take into account the pre-sentence custody in December 1988 - April 1999. He does not challenge the revocation of the order suspending the sentences. To the extent that an extension of time is required to apply for leave to appeal against the sentences imposed on 2 May 2008, it should be granted. The error on which the applicant relies is said to be either failure at the time the sentence was imposed on 2 May 2008, or failure at the time the suspension of the sentence ceased to have effect on 9 October 2009.  
     
      
    7 In sentencing an offender the court must take into account any time for which the offender has been held in custody in relation to the offence, (Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act (s 24(a)). It was accepted that the pre-sentence custody in the present case was solely referable to the offences for which the applicant was sentenced. A court may direct that a sentence be taken to have commenced on a day before that on which it is imposed (s 47(2)(a)), with a specific requirement that in deciding the day pre-sentence custody be taken into account (s 47(3)).  
     
      
    8 The statutory mandate can be fulfilled by backdating the date on which the sentence is to commence, as provided for in s 47(2)(a), or by reducing the sentence imposed. The former course is generally to be preferred, see R v McHugh [1985] 1 NSWLR 588; R v Deeble (CCA, 19 December 1991, unreported); and R v Newman and Simpson [2004] NSWCCA 102, (2004) 145 ACrimR 361 particularly at [22]-[23]. The latter course can be followed for good reason, see R v Deeble and R v Leete [2001] NSWCCA 337, (2001) 25 ACrimR 37. 
     
      
    9 However, the former course, that is, backdating at the time of sentence, is not available when a sentence is suspended pursuant to s 12(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, and by s 12(3) Part 4 of the Act (within which is s 47, which would otherwise dictate a day of commencement of the sentence and allow for backdating) does not apply to a sentence the subject of an order suspending its execution. Thus any pre-sentence custody must either be taken into account by reducing the sentence imposed, in which I include in prescribing the manner in which the sentence is to be served, or by backdating at the time there is revocation of the bond and the sentence descends.  
     
      
    10 It is not necessary to enter into which is the preferable course to adopt. The question for us is whether the first of these courses was in fact adopted by the judge when he sentenced on 2 May 2008. If he did, it is accepted by the applicant that there was no error in failing to backdate on 9 October 2009. Conversely, albeit perhaps with a qualification, it was accepted by the Crown that if he did not there should have been a backdating on 9 October 2009.  
     
      
    11 The remarks on sentence on 2 May 2008 included, in his Honour’s account of the circumstances, that the applicant had been arrested on 16 December 1998 and “spent about four months in custody before he was granted bail.” The pre-sentence custody was not otherwise mentioned.  
     
      
    12 The remarks on sentence included -  
     
      
       
        
        “The offences were serious and require a sentence of imprisonment to be imposed. But in the light of the favourable features mentioned in the pre-sentence report prepared by the Victorian authorities, and in light of the fact that I consider that a sentence of less than two years is called for, I propose to suspend the sentence. I consider this is a satisfactory way of dealing with this matter. It properly reflects the rehabilitative efforts that the offender has made. It recognises the seriousness of his conduct and it also enables me to impose upon Mr Pulitano the sentence he should have got had he been dealt with in 1999 in this court, in the event that he fails to comply with conditions of his bond. Mr Pulitano should be under no misapprehensions as to what is likely to happen should he commit a further offence. He will go to gaol. I will be the one who puts him in gaol if he commits any breach of the good behaviour bond which I will shortly announce.” 
        
       
      
    13 His Honour pronounced the sentences of eighteen months and their suspension. In addressing the applicant at the close of his remarks, his Honour said -  
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Pulitano if you’d been dealt with in 1998 or 1999 you would have gone to gaol. You are not going to gaol because of the good efforts you’ve made to rehabilitate yourself since 2001. But if you commit any offence in the next 18 months or y ou breach the good behaviour bond in any way in the next 18 months, you will be going to gaol for 18 months. You will get the sentence you should have got in 1998, do you understand? 
        
       
      
    14 His Honour was conscious of the pre-sentence custody and is unlikely, given the brief sentencing hearing and the fact that he was making his remarks on sentence immediately thereafter, to have forgotten about it. It is tolerably clear, in my opinion, that he meant that the sentences of imprisonment for eighteen months would be served in full, without any backdating by reason of the pre-sentence custody, in the event of breach of the conditions of the bond. He was emphatic that the applicant would go to gaol for eighteen months. That cannot stand with going to gaol, in context meaning going to gaol in the future in the event of breaching the bond, for about fourteen months because at the later time credit would be given for pre-sentence custody.  
     
      
    15 Albeit not explicitly, in my opinion his Honour did take the pre-sentence custody into account in arriving at the sentences of eighteen months. 
     
      
    16 The Crown submitted more widely that his Honour had taken the pre-sentence custody into account in determining the type of sentence, here the leniency of a suspended sentence. The Crown referred in particular to Whyte v The Crown [2009] NSWCCA 18, in which R A Hulme J, with whom Grove and Howie JJ agreed, said of a submission that the sentencing judge had not taken pre-sentence custody into account when arriving at the term of a suspended sentence - 
     
      
       
        
        “17. The conclusion is inescapable, it seems to me, that the issue of pre-sentence custody was very clearly in her Honour’s mind and she gave the applicant credit for it by acceding to the submission that had been made by counsel on his behalf. Counsel invited her Honour to give effect to the pre-sentence custody by imposing a sentence of less than two years duration and by suspending it. This is precisely what her Honour did.” 
        
       
      
    17 In the present case it is not so clear that the judge was urged to have regard to the pre-sentence custody in imposing a suspended sentence. Of more significance, the remarks on sentence are against this wider submission. His Honour stated two matters in the light of which he proposed to suspend the sentence, namely, the favourable features mentioned in the pre-sentence report and his view that a sentence of less than two years was called for. There was at this point no reference to the pre-sentence custody, and I do not think it can be read into the reasons for suspending the sentence.  
     
      
    18 Notwithstanding this, for the reasons I have given it seems to me that the pre-sentence custody was taken into account in arriving at the sentences of eighteen months.  
     
      
    19 The applicant drew attention to the fact that the sentences of eighteen months were expressed in whole months, whereas the pre-sentence custody was a period of three months and twenty days. He submitted that it was unlikely that the judge had reasoned by first arriving at terms of twenty-one months and twenty-two days and then allowing for the pre-sentence custody in order to reach the eighteen months. Reference was made to R v Howard [2001] NSWCCA 309 at [24], where there was noted a submission that a sentence expressed in round terms did not demonstrate the allowance of two periods of pre-sentence custody, although it is not clear that that submission was accepted. 
     
      
    20 The Crown drew attention to Starmer v R [2008] NSWCCA 27, where it was said at [13], (Grove J, McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J agreeing), that sentencing is not arithmetic and there is no need to sentence only in round figures. Equivalent to that observation, it was not necessary for his Honour to reason in precise figures in arriving at the eighteen months. It was open to his Honour to allow in a more global way for the three months and twenty-two days in coming to the period of eighteen months as the appropriate term for the suspended sentences. This was a valid argument in favour of the applicant, but in my opinion it is not one which outweighs the reasons I have given for my conclusion. 
     
      
    21 In my opinion, therefore, error has not been shown, and it is not necessary further to consider how account might properly be taken of pre-sentence custody in circumstances such as the present. There was no error on 9 October 2009 in failing to backdate by reason of the pre-sentence custody.  
     
      
    22 I therefore propose that leave to appeal be granted but the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    23 R S HULME J: I agree. 
     
      
    24 LATHAM J: I also agree. 
     
      
    25 GILES JA: That will be the order of the Court.

    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Davies J. 
     
      
    2 JAMES J: I agree with Davies J. 
     
      
    3 DAVIES J: On 19 November 2008 the Applicant pleaded guilty to 2 offences as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        [1] Supply not less than a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug (1.7 kilograms of ecstasy) between 9 March 2007 and 12 May 2007 contrary to s 25(2)  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         1985; 
         
         
        [2] Supply a prohibited drug (54.84 grams of methylamphetamine) between 18 April 2007 and 12 May 2007 contrary to s 25(1)  
        Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 
         1985. 
        
       
      
    4 The maximum penalty for the first Count is life imprisonment and there is a standard non-parole period of 15 years. The maximum penalty for the second Count is 15 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    5 In addition, the Applicant asked the Sentencing Judge to take into account 2 additional charges on the Form 1, namely, 2 charges of supplying 56 grams of methylamphetamine, the first between 1 and 7 April 2007 and the second between 16 and 20 April 2007.  
     
      
    6 On 21 January 2009 the Applicant was sentenced by her Honour Judge Tupman as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        [1] On Count 1 (taking into account the Form 1 offences), sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 years commencing 19 July 2007 and expiring on 18 July 2013 with an additional period of 3 years and 4 months commencing on 19 July 2013 and expiring on 18 November 2016. 
         
         
        [2] On Count 2, sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment of 2 years commencing 19 July 2007 and expiring 18 July 2009. 
        
       
       
      On Count 2 her Honour declined to set a non-parole period because she said it would be subsumed within the non-parole period in relation to Count 1.  
       
      
    7 At the same time her Honour sentenced a co-offender Douglas Stewart Ross. He was charged with the same offences. However, Mr Ross asked her Honour to take into account 4 additional charges on the Form 1. The first two were the same as those for which the Applicant was charged and appeared on his Form 1. The other two were the deemed supply of 104.1 grams of methylamphetamine on 12 May 2007, and a charge of dealing with the proceeds of crime, namely, the sum of $4,500 contrary to s 193C(1) Crimes Act 1900. The drug charge had a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment, and the offence contrary to s 193C Crimes Act carried a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment.  
     
      
    8 Her Honour sentenced Mr Ross as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        [1] On Count 1 (taking into account the Form 1 offences), sentenced to a non-parole period of 5 years commencing 11 May 2007 and expiring 10 May 2012 with an additional period of 3 years commencing 11 May 2012 and expiring 10 May 2015.  
         
         
        [2] On Count 2, sentenced to a fixed term of 2 years commencing 1 May 2007 and expiring 10 May 2009.  
        
       
       
      Her Honour declined to set a non-parole period on Count 2 for the same reason as she did in the Applicant’s case. 
       
       
      Facts and circumstances 
       
      
    9 As one of the grounds of appeal relates to parity it is important to understand the approach her Honour took to the co-offender Ross.  
     
      
    10 The facts and circumstances giving rise to the offences are clearly set out by her Honour as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        The facts on which I sentence are that each of these two offenders came to notice during a police investigation which occurred over a number of months involving police undercover investigation. The strike force investigation was into the manufacture and supply of prohibited drugs namely ecstasy and methylamphetamine. The investigation included the lawful interception of telephone calls involving a person Richard Monckton who lived on the far north coast of New South Wales in the Lismore/Ballina area. During the course of monitoring his telephone lines, police became aware of this enterprise involving the manufacture and supply of these two drugs. Amongst those who came to light and whose calls were also then monitored was the offender Mr Fitzsimon. 
         
         
        The Crown case on the agreed facts before me is that Mr Monckton was heavily involved in these illicit drug activities and was assisted in that enterprise by others including the offenders before me. I accept from the facts that it was Mr Fitzsimon's role in this enterprise to take possession of quantities of the drugs and make them available to Mr Ross to then drive from Sydney and deliver them to Mr Monckton on the north coast. The surveillance indicated that during the period covered by the first count in relation to each of these two offenders, there were four separate occasions on which Mr Fitzsimon and Mr Ross were involved in the supply in this way. Mr Ross was a friend of Mr Fitzsimon and became involved just before 15 March 2007. Mr Fitzsimon on the facts was involved in the supply for only a few days longer, namely from 9 March. 
         
         
        Specifically the facts involving this first supply charge are that on 15 March 2007, Mr Fitzsimon arranged for Mr Ross to drive to Mr Monckton on the north coast and there deliver to him 486 grams of ecstasy. This occurred again on 7 April 2007 where Mr Ross delivered 270 grams of ecstasy to Mr Monckton, that having been supplied to him by Mr Fitzsimon. On this occasion he also delivered 56 grams of methylamphetamine also provided to him by Mr Fitzsimon. 
         
         
        This is the subject of the first Form 1 offence for each offender. Again on 20 April 2007, Mr Fitzsimon arranged for Mr Ross to take delivery of and drive up to meet Mr Monckton with 405 grams of ecstasy. On that occasion too, he delivered another 56 grams of methylamphetamine. That latter supply of methylamphetamine is the second of the two additional charges in the Form 1 for each of these two offenders. On 11 May 2007, once again Mr Fitzsimon arranged for Mr Ross to deliver ecstasy tablets to Monckton on the north coast. This time the quantity was 596.8 grams. Mr Ross was stopped by police at Normanhurst on his way and the drugs never reached Monckton on this occasion. In total these four occasions amounted to either the actual delivery or attempted delivery to Monckton of approximately 1.7 kilos of ecstasy and these are the facts relevant for the first count in the indictment against each of these offenders namely the charge of supplying the large commercial quantity of ecstasy. 
         
         
        As well as delivering or attempting to deliver 596.8 grams of ecstasy on 11 May, Mr Fitzsimon had also given Mr Ross 54.04 grams of methylamphetamine to supply to Mr Monckton. This was also found in his possession when he was arrested at Normanhurst. These facts involving this quantity of methylamphetamine are the relevant facts for the second count in the indictment relevant to each of these two offenders. The day following Mr Ross's arrest, police searched his premises and there located a number of things including 104.1 grams of methylamphetamine and the sum of $4,500 in cash. These facts are the relevant facts for the remaining two additionalForm 1 offences against Mr Ross, namely the deemed supply of this quantity of methylamphetamine on 12 May 2007 and the charge of dealing with the proceeds of crime. 
        
       
      
    11 Her Honour then turned to assess the role of each of the offenders and the objective criminality. She said that it was a relatively substantial drug supply organisation in which they were involved but, on the evidence, neither of them stood to gain much money from their involvement. She accepted the evidence that each of the 2 offenders received only the sum of $6000 from their involvement, that that was not a particularly large amount, and that the Applicant used it only to extinguish some pre-existing debt to people from whom he had obtained the drugs.  
     
      
    12 Her Honour accepted that Mr Monckton was in the business of distributing the drugs around the North Coast of NSW and on the Gold Coast. The role of each of Mr Ross and the Applicant was, in a different capacity, to get the drugs to Mr Monckton for that purpose. The drug supply business was connected with a motorcycle club or gang in which the Applicant was involved. His role was as a middleman obtaining the drugs from someone else and then giving them to Mr Ross to deliver to Mr Monckton in the role of a courier. Mr Ross became involved only because he was an acquaintance of the Applicant and because of his own very longstanding addiction to drugs at the time.  
     
      
    13 Her Honour found that Mr Ross was not involved in the gang in any way and that there was no evidence that the gang played any part in the Applicant’s offending other than it was through that association that the Applicant became involved in the offence. Her Honour found that the offence was not aggravated in any way by gang involvement.  
     
      
       
      Subjective features 
       
       
      (a) The Applicant 
       
      
    14 The Applicant was 32 years of age at the time of commission of the offences and was 34 when sentenced. He had, as the Sentencing Judge found, a fairly significant criminal record which commenced in the Children’s Court in 1991 when he was 16 years of age. Except for a low-range PCA in February 2006, the Applicant’s criminal record finished in April 2001.  
     
      
    15 Although the Applicant started using drugs at the age of 15, commencing with cannabis and moving onto amphetamines, none of the offences for which he had been convicted was a drug offence. A number of the offences were, however, offences that might be expected from a person addicted to drugs including dishonesty offences, offences against property and offences against the person.  
     
      
    16 He appears to have developed psychotic symptoms during his teenage years at about the time he commenced using amphetamines. He was subsequently diagnosed with schizophrenia. 
     
      
    17 He has 2 children from 2 relationships. The second child was born from a marriage he had with a Thai woman. That relationship came to an end in acrimonious circumstances, and her Honour found that the events in respect of which she was sentencing the Applicant were occurring during the worst part of that relationship. Both the Applicant and his wife were gambling heavily and using drugs. The gambling debts that had been run up were part of the reason the Applicant involved himself in the drug offences. He was attempting to pay off those debts by the money he was to receive from his involvement in the drug supply.  
     
      
    18 Her Honour found that the Applicant had been, for the 2½ years prior to the sentence, in a relationship with another woman who gave evidence at the sentence proceedings. Her Honour found that woman to be a positive influence on the Applicant. She remained available to provide support for him while he was in prison and on his ultimate release. 
     
      
    19 Her Honour found, from the Applicant’s partner’s evidence, from the Probation and Parole Service and from a psychologist, that the Applicant was well motivated to change his life and to remain drug free, to resume his relationship with his partner and to go to live with her and her children out of the Sydney area where he could obtain work.  
     
      
    20 Her Honour accepted that his prospects of rehabilitation were reasonably good and were much enhanced by the support he had from his partner and from his father and stepmother who were available to provide continuing support.  
     
      
       
      (b) Co-offender Ross 
       
      
    21 Mr Ross was 31 years old at the time of sentence. Her Honour found that his criminal record was of much shorter compass than that of the Applicant. She said that it was in fact of very little relevance when sentencing him for the offences. There were no drug supply or drug related offences on the record and, she said, apart from one period of what would appear to be alcohol-related offences in August 2006 his record was otherwise nonexistent. It should be noted that Mr Ross’s record was not amongst the appeal papers.  
     
      
    22 She noted that he had a significant drug addiction for a long period of time, starting to use marijuana at the age of 18 which led onto other drugs including cocaine, amphetamines and ecstasy from about the age of 25 until he came into custody. He had also been involved in excessive alcohol consumption in the past. 
     
      
    23 Her Honour thought his involvement in the drug offences were very much out of character. She thought he had good prospects for rehabilitation, partly because he had become engaged to a woman with whom he had had a young daughter, and because he was well supported by his family and other persons.  
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    24 The Applicant seeks leave to appeal on 3 grounds as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Her Honour erred by emphasising general deterrence over the Applicant’s mental illness; 
        
       
       
      (2) Her Honour erred in relation to the issue of parity; 
       
       
      (3) The sentence was manifestly excessive. 
       
       
      Ground 1 - Emphasising general deterrence over Applicant’s mental illness; 
       
      
    25 Where a person has a mental disorder or is suffering from a mental illness, that may render the person an inappropriate vehicle for general deterrence and moderate that consideration: R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228 at [34]; R v Engert (1995) 85 A Crim R 67 at 71 and 72; R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 50-51. 
     
      
    26 The Applicant submits that her Honour gave little consideration to the impact of the mental illness upon both the Applicant’s thought processes and the capacity of the offender to appreciate the gravity and significance of the criminal conduct, notwithstanding that the Applicant was appreciably aware of the consequences of his offending behaviour. 
     
      
    27 The Applicant points to the fact that the pre-sentence report noted that the Applicant was diagnosed with schizophrenia in approximately 2000 and that he had been medicated for that illness since that time.  
     
      
    28 The Applicant points also to the report from the psychologist Mr Watson-Munro who noted a troubling clinical and forensic history which had been compounded by the diagnosis of a serious and lifelong psychiatric illness, being the paranoid schizophrenia. Mr Watson-Munro said that it, in all likelihood, was caused in the first instance by a protracted Substance Abuse Disorder involving dangerous stimulant drugs such as Ice, cocaine and amphetamines. 
     
      
    29 Mr Watson-Munro said that the Applicant’s problems were clearly aggravated at a level of clinical significance by his escalating drug abuse. He thought it was clear that the Applicant’s judgment was diminished by virtue of the convergence of his drug abuse superimposed upon an underlying psychotic illness. However, Mr Watson-Munro noted that the Applicant’s problems including paranoia, sleep disturbance and general disorientation in time, place and person did not reach the point where he was unaware of his wrongdoing nor of the consequences of his actions. 
     
      
    30 Mr Watson-Munro noted that the Applicant told him that in the lead up to the drug offences he was in a state of continuous confusion and disorientation. Mr Watson-Munro noted that state was entirely consistent with the body of research material attesting to the adverse effect stimulant drugs such as cocaine and Ice had on the pre-frontal cortex of the brain, an area which is responsible for forward planning, judgment and stability of personality.  
     
      
    31 Her Honour noted the Applicant’s diagnosis for schizophrenia and its relationship to his drug use. She then went on to say a little later: 
     
      
       
        
        Other factors that I take into account involving his subjective circumstances as I have said are his diagnosis for schizophrenia in the past. I accept that more probably than not to some extent, it was either created by or exacerbated by his significant drug use at the time. He is currently on medication for it and it seems to be under control whilst he is in custody. 
        
       
      
    32 Earlier her Honour had said this in relation to general deterrence: 
     
      
       
        
        The sentence of course should carry an element to reflect the note for general deterrence. The evidence before me is that these drugs or at least some of these drugs were in fact distributed to the community at large, that was known to each of the offenders and nonetheless they involved themselves in the offence. The Court is only too aware of the tragedy that is wreaked on the community at large by the scourge of prohibited drugs. The sentence for this and any other drug supply charge particularly one involving a large commercial quantity must include an element to send a message to the community that any involvement in such offences will give rise to a significant period of custody as the penalty. 
        
       
      
    33 It is difficult to see on the basis of those comments, and what her Honour said elsewhere about taking into account the Applicant’s schizophrenia, his drug use and the relationship between the two, that her Honour has emphasised general deterrence over his mental illness. She has obviously taken both matters into account but has not expressly or impliedly weighed one over the other.  
     
      
    34 Indeed, in her oral submissions Ms Nash, on behalf of the Applicant, accepted that her Honour did not in so many words emphasise general deterrence over the mental illness but submitted that the sentence ultimately given indicated that too much weight was placed on deterrence. 
     
      
    35 There seem to me to be 2 considerable difficulties with that submission. The first is that it seems impossible to conclude from the length of the sentence alone that the sentencing judge has given too much weight to general deterrence or no weight or not enough weight to other factors. When it is remembered that the maximum penalty for Court 1 was life imprisonment with a standard non-parole period of 15 years, it is impossible to say that a total sentence of 9 years 4 months with a non-parole period of 6 years (even taking account of the discount for early plea) necessarily leads to the view that general deterrence has been given too much emphasis. 
     
      
    36 The second problem with the submission arises from the fact that it is, in terms, a submission about the amount of weight that the Sentencing Judge has accorded to one factor or another. In Stephens v R [2009] NSWCCA 240 Grove J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and R A Hulme J agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        [16] The applicant advanced two express grounds of appeal. Ground 1 contended that the learned sentencing judge erred in failing to give sufficient weight to the applicant’s mental illness in mitigation of penalty. 
         
         
        [17] There are inherent problems in such a ground succeeding. Although it was said in the context of a Crown appeal, the observation of Spigelman CJ in  
        R v Baker 
         [2000] NSWCCA 85 should be borne in mind:  
         
         
          
           
            
            “The use of terminology such as ‘sufficient weight’ highlights the difficulty for the Crown case. Questions of weight in the exercise of a discretion are matters for the first instance judge. The circumstances in which matters of ‘weight’ will justify intervention by an appellate court are narrowly confined.” 
            
           
          
         
         
        [18] As is obvious, a ground expressed in that fashion tacitly concedes that some weight had been placed by the sentencing judge upon the factor. … 
        
       
      
    37 This is a Court of error. As was emphasised in Stephens, questions of weight are part of the discretion of the Sentencing Judge. It would be necessary for the Applicant to show a House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499 type of error for this Court to be able to intervene. No such error is or could be shown on the basis of what the Sentencing Judge said, nor from the sentence imposed.  
     
      
    38 This ground fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – Error in relation to the issue of parity 
       
      
    39 Her Honour said this: 
     
      
       
        
        Turning then to the appropriate sentences, I assess Mr Fitzsimon’s role in the offence as slightly higher than that of Mr Ross. It was Mr Fitzsimon who obtained the drugs to give to Mr Ross to supply on to Monckton, it was Mr Fitzsimon who was the one with the contacts to enable that to occur. On that basis it seems to me there is no argument for absolute parity between the two of them. There are other factors of course that make parity not appropriate. 
        
       
      
    40 Her Honour then went on to say that she thought without the plea of guilty an overall term of 11 years would have been appropriate and that acknowledged the Form 1 offences. A little later on she said: 
     
      
       
        
        In relation to Mr Ross, taking into account the slightly lesser involvement than that of Mr Fitzsimon and some of the other factors surrounding him, particularly his somewhat greater prospects of rehabilitation but also acknowledging the Form 1 offences for him which are 4 in number compared to 2 for Mr Fitzsimon. It seems to me that absent the plea of guilty an overall term of imprisonment of 10 years would have been appropriate. 
        
       
      
    41 Her Honour provided a discount of 20% for Mr Ross’s plea of guilty and a 15% discount for the Applicant. The distinction made there turned on the timing of the guilty pleas with the Applicant’s plea being made at a later time. No complaint is made about that on the appeal.  
     
      
    42 It was accepted by the Applicant that there were differences in the findings and subjective features between Mr Ross and the Applicant. However, it was submitted that any mitigation or discount (not including the discount for the early plea) which would otherwise have been appropriate based on the differences between the Applicant and Mr Ross should have been balanced out by the fact that Mr Ross had 4 matters taken into account on a Form 1.  
     
      
    43 It is further submitted that her Honour could not reasonably have found that the Applicant’s role in the offences was “slightly higher” than that of the co-offender simply on the basis that it was the Applicant who originally obtained the drugs to give to the co-offender to take to Monckton. 
     
      
    44 The real complaint, as articulated in oral submissions, was that her Honour chose a starting point of 11 years for the Applicant and 10 years for the co-offender.  
     
      
    45 In Lowe v R (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609 Gibbs CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        It may be said that the very existence of the disparity reveals that an error must have been committed, but I would prefer frankly to acknowledge that the reason why the court interferes in such a case is that it considers  
        that the disparity is such 
         as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or in other words to give the appearance that justice has not been done. The decision whether the existence of a disparity calls for intervention is a matter which lies very much within the discretion of the Court of Criminal Appeal. (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    46 Mason J said at 612: 
     
      
       
        
        It has therefore been generally accepted that it is preferable to err on the side of leniency and eliminate or diminish the sense of grievance and appearance of injustice by reducing the more severe penalty in appropriate cases. So the courts have on many occasions reduced a sentence to bring it more into line with the co-offender's penalty,  
        though it is well established that there is no principle of law that sentences must strictly compare: … 
         (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    47 It is not sufficient, therefore, that there is a disparity. It must be such a disparity that gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.  
     
      
    48 The question of parity was ultimately one for her Honour’s discretion. Her Honour was required to weigh up a number of factors. The extent of the 2 offenders’ involvement was, as her Honour made clear, only one such factor. On the facts found by her Honour, Mr Fitzsimon had a larger involvement, albeit slight. It was through the motorcycle club or gang with which he was involved that he became involved in the drug trafficking. He was the person who obtained the drugs from another person and gave them to Mr Ross who, as her Honour found, was a courier. It was Mr Fitzsimon, her Honour found, who got Mr Ross involved.  
     
      
    49 The other factors concerned the difference in the criminal records of the 2 offenders, the Applicant’s being considerably worse than that of Mr Ross. Further, her Honour found that Mr Ross’s involvement in the offences was very much out of character and that he had very good prospects of rehabilitation. Although her Honour found that the Applicant had reasonably good prospects of rehabilitation she noted that she needed to be guarded because in the past the Applicant had been offered counselling and intervention on many occasions and had not always taken full advantage of them.  
     
      
    50 The only matter weighing in the negative for Mr Ross was that he had 2 more drug offences taken into account on the Form 1. However, her Honour accepted that all of the drug offences for both offenders were part of the same criminal enterprise. In fact, it can reasonably be inferred from the facts that the co-offender was unlucky in having different quantities of the drug in different places with the result that when the police searched his premises they found quantities of the same drug that he also had in his possession when stopped in the car.  
     
      
    51 The other 2 Form 1 offences with which the co-offender was charged do not stand out as requiring any particular weight to be given to them to balance the position of the Applicant and the co-offender to a point of parity. Ultimately it was a matter for the discretion of the Sentencing Judge. The difference in sentence (effectively a 1 year non-parole period) is, as I have said, only partly explicable by the different factors that the Sentencing Judge weighed because of the different discounts for early pleas.  
     
      
    52 In my opinion, no error has been shown in this regard and this ground is not made out. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 - Sentence was manifestly excessive 
       
      
    53 No independent submissions were made about this ground and the written submissions suggest that it is related to the other 2 grounds, both of which are said to have resulted in an excessive sentence. 
     
      
    54 Considered without reference to those other grounds the sentence, particularly in the light of the maximum penalty and the standard non-parole period, does not appear to be excessive in any way that suggests error on the part of the Sentencing Judge. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion 
       
      
    55 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
        (1) Leave to appeal granted. 
        
       
       
       (2) Appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 JAMES J: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant pleaded guilty to two offences of indecent assault on a child under the age of 10 years. These were offences contrary to s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for an offence contrary to that section is imprisonment for 10 years. Curiously, having regard to the maximum penalty, there is a standard non-parole period of 8 years. 
     
      
    3 On 19 May 2009 Finnane DCJ sentenced the applicant to a total sentence of 7 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. That sentence dated from 19 May 2009 and the applicant is eligible to be released to parole on 18 May 2013. 
     
      
    4 There are four grounds of appeal filed as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The sentencing judge erred by omitting to assess the objective seriousness of the offences. 
         
         
        2. The sentencing judge erred by failing to allow a discount for an early plea of guilty and to give reasons why such a discount should not be given. 
         
         
        3. The sentencing judge failed to determine, and find, that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. 
         
         
        4. The sentences for these offences are manifestly excessive. 
        
       
       
      The facts 
      
    5 There was an agreed statement of facts tendered that had been signed by both the applicant and the prosecutor. They can be summarised as follows. The complainants were two girls, one was aged nine years and the other eight years. They resided with their mother in Cowra. The mother was a member of an Internet site used to chat with and meet people. She came into contact with the applicant through this site. The relationship commenced with the exchange of messages and progressed quickly to regular telephone calls. Two weeks after they had first come into contact the applicant travelled from Taree to Cowra to stay at the home of the mother. 
     
      
    6 On 2 May 2008 the applicant met up with the mother and they returned to her home. The sleeping arrangements in the house were that the mother and younger daughter slept in a queen-size bed. There was a single bed in the same room in which the elder daughter and her eight-year-old brother slept. 
     
      
    7 After sharing an evening meal with the family, the applicant showered and got into the bed in which the mother and younger daughter slept. About five minutes later that child got into the bed. The applicant touched her initially on the outside of her pyjamas but shortly moved his hand inside and touched and caressed her bottom. He then moved his hand to the front of the child and placed it inside her underpants. He touched her on the vagina for between five and ten minutes. The applicant told the child that it was “their secret” and she should not tell any other person. 
     
      
    8 Later the mother got into bed with the applicant and the child. Sometime later the other two children retired into the single bed and went to sleep. 
     
      
    9 The following day, Saturday 3 May, the applicant woke to find the mother and the elder daughter in bed with him. He tried to speak to the mother but she was unresponsive and he assumed she was asleep. The applicant began to touch the elder daughter on the bottom on the outside of her nightie. He then moved his hand under her underpants and continued to caress her bottom. He then touched her on the vagina area first on top of the underpants and then beneath them. This conduct lasted about five minutes. 
     
      
    10 Later that day the mother and her children went to a family gathering and the applicant remained in the house. They returned about 7pm that evening. At some stage, while they were all sitting in the lounge room, the elder daughter complained that the applicant, “touched my bottom and flower”, the latter being a term used by the child for her vagina. The applicant denied the allegation but the younger daughter immediately made the same complaint. The mother told the applicant to pack his bags and leave the house. As he was departing the house, two motor vehicles pulled up carrying a number of males who were related to the mother. These persons, after making a number of accusations against the applicant, assaulted him. Police were called and the applicant was taken to hospital where he remained overnight for observations. The next day he was arrested and admitted to the assaults upon the two complainants. 
     
      
       
        
        The subjective case 
        
       
      
    11 The applicant was born on 17 September 1977. He has no criminal record apart from an offence involving social security benefits for which he was dealt with in the Melbourne Magistrates Court in 2003. He was placed on a good behaviour bond and fined. 
     
      
    12 Because the applicant was living in Victoria at the time, a presentence report was prepared by a Community Corrections Officer in that State. The report indicated that the applicant was born in New South Wales and lived with his mother until he entered into a relationship with a girlfriend whom he later married. They eventually separated and the applicant has two children from that marriage. They live with their mother and he has minimal contact with them. He had a further relationship from which he had a child, a girl aged six at the time of the sentencing proceedings. That child lives with her mother. 
     
      
    13 The applicant entered into a third relationship and married again in 2007. He and his wife separated briefly and it was at this time that he made contact with the mother of the complainants. The applicant and his wife were reconciled by the time of the sentencing proceedings. He normally resides with his wife in a rented house in Victoria with her children aged 16 and 14. 
     
      
    14 The applicant had not been in employment for about three years prior to the offending and stated that he had been unable to gain employment after the offences because of the impact of the proceedings. The applicant has never used illicit drugs and only drinks alcohol on “special occasions”. 
     
      
    15 The officer, who wrote the report, formed the view that the applicant’s family and friends were in denial in respect of the offences. The applicant had expressed anger with the fact that the complainants had been in the bed. He had been unable to explain fully why the offences had occurred but said that it was because of his tiredness. 
     
      
    16 The report was not of any assistance to the applicant because of his conduct with the officer attempting to assess him. It contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……….When an appointment was being arranged with [the applicant] for the environmental scan, [the applicant] became aggressive screaming “judgement judgement”. [The applicant] was spoken the day prior to advise that such aggression and intimation [?] will not be tolerated and he needed to understand that he was being assessed for an order. When undertaking the assessment [the applicant] presented in a negative manner answering questions on behalf of his wife and asking why they had not investigated the victims for being in the bed. It was then asked if [the applicant] was willing to be sentenced to an order to which after deliberation with his wife decided he “might as well give it a go”. 
         
        
       
      
    17 Ultimately it was determined that the applicant was not suitable for any Community Based Disposition due to his “perceived lack of motivation or understanding of the impact of his offending”. The report went on, 
     
      
       
        
         
        ……… it appears evident that [the applicant] has little if any victim empathy, and has no remorse for his actions (as confirmed by the lack of empathy, and his continued victim blaming). 
        
       
      
    18 There was also in evidence a report prepared by a psychologist and a Therapeutic Manager with the Sexual Offenders Programmes within the New South Wales Department of Corrective Services. The applicant had told the authors of this report that the offence was “out of character for me, I don’t know what came over me, I was tired, I hadn’t slept, I had been awake, I wasn’t thinking”. The authors concluded that the applicant demonstrated little victim insight and also lacked insight into the factors that may have contributed to his offences. The applicant was “unable to describe any strategies that could prevent him from reoffending”. 
     
      
    19 This report contained the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Although [the applicant] does not deny committing the offences, he appears to be minimising the extent of his responsibility and demonstrated little insight into his behaviour. [The applicant’s] feelings of isolation and rejection, intimacy deficits, hostility and deficits in emotional regulation all appear to be related to his offending behaviour……….. 
        
       
      
    20 There was also in evidence a presentence report. The report contains the following under the heading “Attitude to the Offences”: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The offender could offer no explanation for his offending behaviour. He stated that he had met the victim’s mother on the Internet at a time when he was separated from his wife. He concurred with the police facts stating that they were accurate in every detail. He added that the children had not tried to stop him when he assaulted them. He also believed that the victims were awake when he assaulted them. He did not deny telling the first victim not to tell anybody what he had done. 
         
         
        When questioned repeatedly as to why he offended he maintained that he obtained no sexual gratification for his behaviour but could not verbalise why he had offended against the second victim the next morning. 
        
       
      
    21 The report contained the following summary: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………… He appears to be a person of low self-esteem who has had difficulty in maintaining long-term relationships with women. [The applicant’s] offences were opportunistic. It is of concern that he repeated his offending behaviour with the second child the next morning without any restraint. He seems to lack insight into the seriousness of his offending behaviour and was incapable of offering any explanation for his behaviour. 
        
       
      
    22 There was in evidence two reports from a psychologist whom the applicant had seen in Victoria. The psychologist reported that the applicant “has consistently evidenced: (a) deep shame, guilt, and remorse; (b) an inability to ‘explain’ why these events occurred”. The psychologist gave examples of quotes from the applicant that supported these findings. The psychologist gave possible reasons why the applicant could not explain the occurrence of these offences. One of these the psychologist thought was “unlikely but possible”. The psychologist indicated that he was prepared to counsel and treat the applicant.  
     
      
    23 The applicant gave evidence at the sentencing hearing. He was asked why he had committed the offences and he answered: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I have no excuses in what I have committed. I have no idea why they were done in the first place. I feel so bad for what I have done and there is not a day where I don’t think about how bad I have ruined everyone’s life including their lives, the children’s lives, the mother’s life, my life, my wife’s life, everyone’s life I have ruined. 
        
       
      
    24 In relation to the Victorian report he stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The thing is I was treated very unfairly. I was not really given a fair go in terms of - I was basically treated as though I did the wrong thing and I had to suffer the consequences which in fact I do have to suffer but I was not giving – not given an opportunity to state my case so to speak. 
         
         
        HIS HONOUR: Well what is the case that you didn’t have the opportunity to state? 
         
         
        A. Well your Honour I was - my wife and I were in the conference and we were – we were basically treated as second-class citizens. We - we – we have - I have done what I have done wrong yes I admit to that but it was just treated – I was very mistreated. 
        
       
      
    25 He was asked by the prosecutor about his suggestion in the Victorian report that the children should not have been in the bed and he replied: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Well I naturally would assume that would be a natural parent reaction. Why would you let your children in the same bed as a stranger is what gets me. 
        
       
      
    26 The applicant’s wife gave evidence. She stated that she was supporting the applicant even though she was surprised and shocked by the offences. She did not believe they were in his nature. She stated that, although she initially blamed the complainants, she did not do so at the time of giving evidence. 
     
      
       
      The sentencing remarks 
      
    27 The Judge sentenced the applicant on the mistaken belief, not corrected by either of the parties before him, that the relevant standard non-parole period was five years. In the course of his remarks, His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Statistics show that most sexual offenders who have committed this offence had been sentenced to prison the biggest majority of them for three years and some as long as six years. And the non-parole periods go from six years to more than five years on statistics. Though statistics do not of course tell the whole story. In recent times the courts have been adopting an ever tougher view about sentencing for this sort of offence where the legislature has recently increased the standard non-parole period to eight years so that for a middle range offence following a conviction at trial the person convicted would be eligible for eight-tenths of the maximum sentence. It can only be said that indicates an attitude of the Parliament that this sort of offence should be regarded as very serious 
        
       
      
    28 In respect of the standard non-parole provisions, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The standard non-parole period at the time apparently was five years, it is now eight years. That means if he had been convicted at trial that is what I would have had to first consider as the number one guidepost. I would have to consider imposing that unless there was something to show some good reason for not doing it. He has pleaded guilty, I am not obliged to impose a standard non-parole period. Nor am I obliged to consider imposing the maximum sentence. As this is his first offence, it would be most unusual to consider a maximum sentence. However I have to look at and give consideration to the standard non-parole period and I have to give consideration to the maximum sentence as two very important guideposts to sentencing. 
        
       
      
    29 The Judge imposed the same sentence for each offence being a term of 6 years with a non-parole period of three years. They were made accumulative by a period of 12 months, and hence the total sentence of 7 years with an overall non-parole period of 4 years was derived. 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 1 
        
       
      
    30 The complaint is that the Judge failed to determine the objective seriousness of the offences as he was required to do in accordance with the decisions of this Court concerned with the application of the standard non-parole provisions. 
     
      
    31 Unfortunately it must be said that the sentencing remarks are completely inadequate insofar as they indicate how his Honour determined the sentences he imposed. There is scant regard, if any, to the staged approach that has been held to be necessary where there is a standard non-parole period even after a plea of guilty: MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; 164 A Crim R 93. Almost five years ago in R v Mills [2005] NSWCCA 175; 154 A Crim R 40 at [49] Wood CJ at CL said:  
     
      
       
        
         
        “… more is expected than mere lip service to the legislation. What is required is a clear identification of the relevant factors, the weight given to them, and their role in the structuring of the sentencing order”.  
        
       
      
    32 With respect, the passage of the sentencing remarks last quoted above is meaningless as to the process by which his Honour determined the appropriate sentence. Is does not contain a “clear identification of the relevant factors”. In particular the Judge fails to undertake any assessment of the objective seriousness of the offences or to indicate why he is departing from the standard non-parole period. This is another instance of a failure by a District Court Judge to attempt to carry out the process that this Court has mandated when dealing with an offence that carries a standard non-parole period. His Honour’s sentencing discretion clearly miscarried. This Court will have to consider whether any lesser sentence is warranted. 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 2 
        
       
      
    33 The complaint is that the Judge did not indicate whether or not the applicant was to receive any discount for the utilitarian value of his early pleas. 
     
      
    34 The answer to this contention is that his Honour said this just before imposing sentence: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “Taking into account all those matters including the plea of guilty and giving him the benefit of the maximum discount……… 
        
       
      
    35 However, it was also submitted that, if his Honour did give the applicant the benefit of a discount of 25 percent, the starting point of 8 years was manifestly excessive as it placed the applicant’s offences in the “range of the worst 20 per cent of cases for offences of this kind”. As this Court will have to re-sentence the applicant, it will take into account a discount of 25 percent when determining whether any lesser sentence is warranted. 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 3 
        
       
      
    36 The complaint is that the Judge failed to determine that the applicant had good prospects of rehabilitation. It was submitted that such a finding “would have a real bearing on the actual sentence imposed”.  
     
      
    37 The Judge referred to the finding in the Victorian report that the applicant had a “low to moderate risk of re-offending”. The applicant points to a number of further matters that he contends ought to have led to a finding favourable to him on the issue of rehabilitation. This included a statement made by the applicant in evidence that he was prepared to undertake counselling, his lack of prior offending and his expressions of contrition and remorse. 
     
      
    38 As against these matters there was the continued attitude of the applicant that in some way the children were to blame, or at least the offending would not have occurred had they not been in the bed. Although the Victorian psychiatrist suggested that this was due to the applicant’s shame, there was ample evidence of his lack of insight into his conduct and a lack of empathy for the complainants. Further the Judge was entitled to take into account the “explanation” for the commission of the offences as being the result of tiredness and his statement that he was not sexually aroused. Although the Victorian psychiatrist posited what appear to be unconvincing reasons for the applicant’s “explanation”, it was open to the Judge to reject the applicant’s account and find that he was attempting to minimise his conduct. This somewhat lessened the applicant’s statements of contrition. 
     
      
    39 In resentencing the applicant I would not be prepared to find that he had good prospects of rehabilitation considering the whole of the history of what he has said about the offences and his attitude to them. In any event his prospects of rehabilitation depends upon his involvement in treatment programmes either in the community or in gaol. Without him having undertaken those programmes, I would not be able to form a view one way or the other about his likelihood of re-offending. This is particularly so in light of the fact that he committed the identical offence on two different children some hours apart. 
     
      
    40 But the sentencing Judge gave him the benefit of reducing the non-parole period well below the statutory relationship so that the effective non-parole period was 56 percent of the total term. He could not have come to that decision unless he gave the applicant the benefit of a finding of some prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    41 This ground fails. 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 4 
        
       
      
    42 This ground need not be addressed because this Court is required to sentence the applicant itself in light of the failure of the Judge to exercise his discretion appropriately as was found under ground 1. 
     
      
    43 The applicant submits that the offences fell well below the mid range of seriousness for offences under this section. I do not agree. Touching a child on the outside of her vagina and under clothing for a significant period of time is a serious example of an offence under this section. True it is that matters of aggravation that could have made the offence more serious were absent, but had any of them been present the offence would probably have been high in the mid range of seriousness or above it. The absence of aggravating features does not mitigate the seriousness of the offence actually committed. 
     
      
    44 I do not accept that the offending was mitigated because the touching of the children was relatively brief. I do not understand that the effect upon the child depends upon the length of time of the abuse. In any event, neither of the offences could be called fleeting. In both cases the applicant progressed from touching the child on the bottom to moving around to the vaginal area. They were not momentary aberrations. 
     
      
    45 The suggestion that they occurred because he was tired, even if accepted, was hardly a mitigating factor. Nor is it a matter of mitigation that a child is sexually abused even though the abuser does not obtain any sexual satisfaction. It is the harm to the child that is the nub of the offence. 
     
      
    46 The sentences imposed were the same even though the first offence was against a child aged 8, being an age significantly less than the statutory age of 10 to which this offence applies. The offence on the younger child was more serious and should have carried a more severe penalty. The offences occurred in the children’s home by a person who was in effect a stranger and who had been trusted to stay with the family and to sleep in a bed where the child normally slept. Both of the offences occurred in the mother’s bed, a place where the complainants were entitled to feel safe. 
     
      
    47 It was suggested that the impact upon the victims “would fall at the lower end of severity for cases of this type”. That is a submission that should be rejected. The Court cannot make any decision about what might be the impact upon the children of such conduct. In R v King [2009] NSWCCA 117 this Court stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [41] No one could know at the date of sentencing what emotional or psychological harm might have been occasioned to the child in the long term. The early complaint makes it obvious that the child knew that the conduct was wrong and that she found it distressing. It is significant that the act was committed by a stranger. It should not be assumed, without evidence to the contrary, that there is no significant damage by way of long-term psychological and emotional injury resulting from a sexual assault of a child who is old enough, as was the complainant, to appreciate the significance of the act committed by the offender. It should be assumed that there is a real risk of some harm of more than a transitory nature occurring. That should be a factor taken into account when sentencing for a child sexual assault offence. It is an inherent part of what makes the offence so serious. It was the appreciation of the likelihood of harm that Mason P saw as changing the community attitude to sexual assaults against young children: see  
        R v MJR 
         (2002) 54 NSWLR 368 at [57]. 
        
       
       
      Those comments apply equally to this case. 
       
      
    48 In my opinion each of the offences was in the mid range of objective seriousness even if towards the lower end of that range in respect of the 9 year old child. This is not to suggest that a particular type of conduct will always fit into a particular range of offending. It will depend upon the circumstances in which the conduct occurred. It is impossible in my view, for example, to determine whether touching a child on his or her sexual organ is more or less serious than having the child touch the offender’s sexual organ. In King this Court held that it cannot be said that one particular type of sexual penetration is always less or more serious than another type of penetration.  
     
      
    49 The extra–curial punishment was of little significance given the seriousness of the offences and the relatively minor injuries inflicted upon the applicant. 
     
      
    50 The Judge referred to the sentencing statistics and we have had them placed before us. They are of little, or no relevance. There are few examples of cases where the standard non-parole period was 8 years. In any event the statistics have less relevance in cases where there is a standard non-parole period. Usually this Court has noted that the statistics show that apparently little regard is being had to the standard non-parole period. 
     
      
    51 We have been provided with an affidavit sworn by the applicant for the purpose of re-sentencing him. Although he has been placed on protective custody, the only effect seems to have been to limit his opportunity for courses and programmes. He has employment and is in a minimum security classification. He has the support of his parents and wife. He is still willing to undertake courses when he is in a position to do so. 
     
      
    52 There is nothing in the affidavit that would indicate any different sentence than that imposed by the Judge is appropriate. As I have already indicated he received a very favourable non-parole period in relation to the overall term of imprisonment. Although had I been sentencing as first instance, I would have made one sentence more severe than the other because of the difference in the ages of the children, I see no reason to resentence simply to achieve that result while leaving the overall sentence imposed the same. The sentence is a heavy one but that is due largely to the effect of the standard non-parole period on offences that were in the mid range of objective seriousness. Yet having regard to the standard non-parole period, a total non-parole period of 4 years for two offences of mid range seriousness is the least sentence that could possibly be imposed. 
     
      
    53 I propose that the Court orders that the application for leave is granted but the appeal dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The appellant, Kaniappa Raju, was convicted following a trial with a jury of the murder of his wife, Aruna Verma. He appeals against that conviction.  
     
      
    2 The appellant was sentenced to 21 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 16 years. He has abandoned an application for leave to appeal against his sentence. He appeals his conviction on four grounds. He firstly submitted that the verdict of the jury is unreasonable or cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. The second ground is concerned with the failure of the Crown to call a witness, Anthony Whittal. The third ground is concerned with the fact that the jury were not informed of the appellant’s earlier acquittal of a charge of attempted murder. In the fourth ground he argued that the appellant suffered a miscarriage of justice because of the way in which the jury was “effectively invited to speculate on the significance” of an exhibit in the trial. 
     
      
       
      History of proceedings 
       
      
    3 The appellant has been in custody in relation to this matter since 17 November 2004 when he was arrested in the Solomon Islands. He was extradited to Australia on 8 February 2005. Upon arrival in Sydney he was charged with the attempted murder and murder of the deceased. The attempted murder was alleged to have been committed on or about 5 May 2002 and the murder on 2 June 2002.  
     
      
    4 There have been three trials. The appellant’s first trial commenced on 6 October 2006 but was aborted on 19 October 2006 due to the unavailability of witnesses from the Solomon Islands. The second trial commenced on 4 July 2007. The jury returned a verdict of not guilty to the charge of attempted murder but was unable to reach a verdict on the charge of murder. The third trial on the charge of murder commenced on 24 October 2007. The jury returned a guilty verdict on that occasion. The appellant was sentenced on 14 December 2007. 
     
      
       
      Factual matters 
       
      
    5 The appellant was born on 12 July 1961. The deceased, Aruna Verma, was born in Fiji on 5 November 1966. She was last seen on 2 June 2002. She has not been heard of since and no body has been found. The appellant and the deceased had been in a de facto relationship since 1993 and lived in premises at 40 Kembla Street, Port Kembla from August 2000. The appellant and the deceased had four children between them, who were aged between 4 and 8 years at the time of the deceased’s disappearance. 
     
      
    6 The deceased first came to Australia in 1988 on a Student Visa, which she overstayed. She left the country in 1991 but returned with her children on 4 December 1999. Her International Movement Records do not indicate that she left Australia after that date. The visa on which she entered Australia in December 1999 was also overstayed; she was an unlawful non-citizen between 5 January 2000 and 12 June 2001 and had been refused a Protection Visa, which she claimed on the basis of political tensions in Fiji. She was however granted a Bridging Visa, pending the determination of the appeal against the refusal to issue her with a Protection Visa, which included a condition that she could not work.  
     
      
    7 The appellant also maintained a relationship with Mary Vousa who lived in Brisbane and with whom he had an infant son who was born in 2000. The appellant lived in Brisbane with Ms Vousa in early 2002 before returning to Port Kembla in approximately April 2002. He continued to visit Ms Vousa in Brisbane on occasions.  
     
      
    8 Evidence was adduced by the appellant suggesting that the deceased had also formed a relationship with another person, Chinna Goundar, who was a cousin of the appellant. It was the Crown case that the appellant was fearful that the deceased may leave him and take the children to live with Chinna Goundar. 
     
      
    9 Mr Goundar was eventually removed from Australia following an anonymous report to the authorities. The report was actually made by the appellant and alleged that Goundar had breached the conditions of his Visa which prohibited him from working. Goundar was sent to Villawood detention centre and was then deported to the Solomon Islands.

    10 Although a condition of her Bridging Visa was that the deceased could not work, she obtained paid employment at a café owned by Rebecca Shey-Ly and her husband, Rohan Hankinson. Ms Shey-Ly gave evidence that the deceased worked approximately five to seven hours each day, Monday to Friday, although the times she worked varied from week to week.  
     
      
    11 The deceased took some time off work in late April 2002, having told Ms Shey-Ly that she intended to travel to Brisbane with the appellant. The deceased returned to work about 2 May and worked for a couple of days. The days immediately following 2 May 2002 were the last time that the deceased worked.  
     
      
    12 An anonymous claim which, as it happens, was also made by the appellant was made to the Immigration Department on 1 May 2002 alleging that the deceased had been working in breach of her Visa. Representatives of the Department of Immigration visited Ms Shey-Ly on 29 May 2002 to investigate the allegation. The deceased’s employer had no idea that she had been working illegally. Evidence was given at the trial which unsurprisingly confirmed that the deceased was fearful of being discovered, taken into detention, possibly deported and separated from her children. 
     
      
    13 Ms Shey-Ly, who had observed the deceased together with her children, gave evidence that the deceased was a loving mother, who had a warm and loving relationship with her children. 
     
      
    14 The deceased disappeared on Sunday 2 June 2002. The last person to speak with her was her sister Anjini Rhodes. They spoke on the telephone in a call which ended at 9.19 that morning. The sisters were close. In that telephone call the deceased told Ms Rhodes that the appellant had gone to Sunday school with the children. She also said that the deceased had accessed her mobile telephone and redialled the numbers in it and she believed he would have concluded that she had been asking for assistance from the Red Cross. She told her sister that the appellant had said to her “you will take my kids to the Red Cross over my dead body.”  
     
      
    15 As it happens on the morning of 2 June the deceased’s mobile telephone had been used to telephone the Red Cross at 8.12 am; at 8.13 am to telephone the Refugee Caseworker Service in Surry Hills and at 8.14 am to the mobile telephone of Gustavo Sierra, the man with whom the appellant was working at the time. The Crown alleged, and this would seem probable, that it was the appellant who had accessed the deceased’s telephone and made these calls. 
     
      
    16 In their conversation that morning the deceased and her sister made an arrangement that the following morning they would meet at Central Railway Station around 11.30 am. The deceased intended to leave the appellant and take her children. She indicated that she would go that morning to the Wollongong Women’s Centre to collect the children’s passports which had been placed there for safekeeping and so that the appellant would not know where they were. 
     
      
    17 The deceased did not meet Ms Rhodes on the Monday morning and Ms Rhodes has not heard from her since the conversation on Sunday morning. Given the relationship between them this is extraordinary. It is compelling evidence that Ms Verma is dead. 
     
      
    18 The evidence confirmed that before 2 June Ms Rhodes was a regular visitor at her sister’s house and they spoke regularly on the telephone, as often as twice a day. They both worked in the city and would meet at Central Station while waiting for their respective trains. They would also speak on the telephone after they boarded their trains. 
     
      
    19 Ms Rhodes gave evidence of the friction she observed between the appellant and the deceased. She said that in early May the appellant took the children to Queensland. She spoke to the appellant a day or two later and he told her “She’s having an affair and when she confesses then I’ll bring the kids back.” Ms Rhodes went to stay with the deceased at Port Kembla and one morning the appellant showed up at around 6 am with all but one of the children. The appellant and the deceased argued and Ms Rhodes decided to take the children and the deceased back to her home. She dropped the deceased at Wollongong railway station, her car could not accommodate all of them, and the deceased travelled by train to Ms Rhodes home. 
     
      
    20 The deceased and her children returned to Wollongong on the following Sunday – it was Mother’s Day – the appellant having come to pick them up. The deceased and Ms Rhodes continued to speak everyday, probably a few times each day. The deceased told her that she was scared and could not sleep. She said in evidence that her sister sounded very scared. Ms Rhodes helped the deceased by providing her with small sums of money. 
     
      
    21 On 31 May Ms Rhodes rang the deceased who told her that she had telephoned the Red Cross in Sydney who had given her an appointment for the following Monday when she was also to take the children. She discussed whether Ms Rhodes should come to Sydney on the Sunday to help with the children. This did not happen because the railway was closed for maintenance but also because the deceased did not want the appellant to find out that Ms Rhodes was involved in their problems. 
     
      
    22 It was the Crown case that this evidence makes plain that the relationship between the deceased and the appellant was at an end and that the deceased had determined to leave and take the children. It was submitted that by reason of the knowledge he gained from the deceased’s mobile telephone on the Sunday the appellant deduced her intention to leave and rather than lose his children decided to kill Ms Verma. 
     
      
    23 A neighbour, Mr Peter Petrevski, lived three houses away. He gave evidence which was consistent with there being an argument between the appellant and the deceased at about the time the deceased’s mobile telephone was used to contact the Red Cross. He said he heard yelling “Just ordinary screaming and yelling, like when someone’s upset, you know, like, you’re stupid or things like that.” 
     
      
    24 Ms Georgina Assuamae was a nanny who had been with the family for a considerable time, having originally come to Australia with them from the Solomon Islands. She remembers that before she left the house on the Sunday morning she heard the deceased yelling, but does not remember whether her anger was directed at the children or the appellant. 
     
      
    25 The appellant left the home at around 8.30 am and, apart from the youngest, Michelle, took the children and dropped them off at the Salvation Army Sunday school located in Burelli Street at around 9 am. Shortly after the appellant left the home Ms Assuamae took Michelle to the local church. She did not return home until shortly after 11 am by which time the appellant had collected the other children from Sunday school and returned home. 
     
      
    26 The Crown case was that having dropped the children at Sunday school the appellant returned home and killed his wife. His subsequent movements would allow for him to have secreted her body until he could dispose of it later that morning. 
     
      
    27 The telephone records confirm that the deceased must have been alive at 9.19 am when she spoke to her sister. Ms Jacobs, the Sunday school teacher confirmed that the appellant picked up the children at “around 10 am.” The time to travel from the Sunday school to the appellant’s home and back to the Sunday school was about 20 minutes. Accordingly, the Crown case was that at some time between 9.20 and 9.45 am the appellant returned to the house and killed the deceased. 
     
      
    28 Although the Crown case was not dependent on it the evidence at the trial would allow for the appellant to have initially secreted the deceased’s body in a sulo bin, which was later disposed of with the body. Three bins had been issued by the council to the appellant’s premises but only two could be located. The appellant owned a large vehicle which was capable of carrying the bin if this in fact occurred. Of course the bin may also have been misplaced in some manner unrelated to the events of the Sunday morning. 
     
      
    29 The appellant gave varying explanations of his movements after leaving his children at Sunday school. It varied from waiting outside the Sunday school building listening to some CDs, to having driven to a spot near the lighthouse where he listened to some CDs. 
     
      
    30 When he arrived home with the older children, Ms Assuamae having not returned, the oldest daughter, Patricia, said that the appellant left her in charge of the other children saying that he was going for a drive to look for their mother. When Ms Assuamae came home the appellant had returned but left again saying that he was going to look for the deceased. He implied that he was concerned that she may be contemplating suicide. Ms Assuamae said that he left and came back after about 15 minutes saying that he could not find the deceased. When the appellant returned he told them all to pack up their clothes for Queensland. The appellant made a call from a payphone to Ms Vousa’s landline at 12.51 pm which is likely to have been during the second time that he left the premises. 
     
      
    31 It is significant that although the appellant claimed to be concerned about the deceased and to have gone looking for her he did not do what most people would and ring her mobile telephone. This omission is entirely inconsistent with any genuine attempt to locate her. 
     
      
    32 At about 3 pm on the Sunday afternoon the appellant left his home and drove with the children and Ms Assuamae to Ms Vousa’s home in Brisbane where they arrived in the early hours of 3 June. He thereafter arranged for Ms Vousa to be able to withdraw money from his bank account. He booked himself a one way ticket to Honiara in the Solomon Islands and left the next day. He left his children with Ms Vousa. He did not return to Australia until extradited on 8 February 2005. The appellant was apparently told by Ms Vousa on 7 June 2002 that the police were looking for him. 
     
      
       
      The alleged confession 
       
      
    33 Evidence was given by Mr Gerby Kalavasiri in which he said that the appellant admitted that he had murdered Ms Verma. In June and July 2002 Mr Kalavasiri was the book keeper for a company run by Mr Roland Timou which ran “Hot Bread Kitchens.” Mr Kalavasiri said that on occasions the appellant would call by allegedly to see Mr Timou and on occasion would use Mr Kalavasiri’s office telephone to ring his children. After one call, which was apparently unsuccessful, the appellant told Mr Kalavasiri that the children’s aunt must have disconnected the telephone. 
     
      
    34 Mr Kalavasiri gave the following evidence of a discussion with the appellant after asking him what had happened. He said that the appellant said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… his wife had an affair with his nephew and that, um, he, he was angry with that and he wanted to, to kill his nephew but he escaped and - 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What else did he say? 
         
        A: Yeah, Then he said, um, that he, that he took his children to the church, um, then he left them there. Then he returned within 30 minutes. Um, he said: ‘Aruna is missing in action’ …” 
        
       
      
    35 Then he went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “A: Yes, I asked him, because I don’t really understand, what he meant by ‘missing in action’. So I asked him: ‘What, what do you mean you killed her?’ Then he said, yes - 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did he say why? 
         
        A: Yeah, That’s when he told me that because she had an affair with his nephew.” 
        
       
      
    36 Mr Kalavasiri said that the appellant told him “that the body was taken care of by his friends and that the body was burning in, somewhere in the mountain near Wollongong”, and that “during summer it will smell but if it’s winter it, yeah, but it won’t smell during winter.” 
     
      
    37 Considerable doubt was cast on the reliability of Mr Kalavasiri’s evidence at the trial. Mr Kalavasiri was interviewed by the police in the Solomon Islands on 13 September 2006 when he made no mention of a conversation with the appellant which contained a confession. It was not until he spoke with his then employer, Mr Christopher Kwan, that he disclosed the appellant’s alleged confession. Mr Kwan said that he should tell the police. Mr Kwan later contacted an officer attached to the Australian High Commission in Honiara and took Mr Kalavasiri to the Commission building. 
     
      
    38 When he was cross examined Mr Kwan agreed that Mr Kalavasiri had told him that the body was buried in the mountains near Wollongong “where the snow would cover the body in winter.” Mr Kwan initially said that he knew Mr Timou only as an acquaintance but ultimately admitted that they had had a business relationship. Although Mr Kwan was living in the Solomon Islands in 2004, at which time he knew Mr Timou, he said that he did not know that Mr Timou had been charged with the attempted murder of the appellant during that year. Mr Kwan denied the suggestion that Mr Timou had offered to assist him if he gave evidence against the appellant. 
     
      
       
      Possible evidence of Mr Whittal 
       
      
    39 At the first trial the Crown Prosecutor’s opening address included reference to another admission allegedly made by the appellant that he had killed Ms Verma. The admission was said to have been made to Mr Anthony Whittal. Mr Whittal was called on a “Basha” inquiry following which defence counsel sought to persuade the trial judge to exclude part of his evidence. The trial judge was then told that the prosecution was having difficulty in having some police officers from the Solomon Islands give evidence at the trial. There were indications that their evidence may have impacted adversely on the evidence to be given by Mr Whittal. Because of their unavailability the jury were discharged when the Crown made plain that it intended to call Mr Whittal.  
     
      
    40 Mr Whittal was called at the second trial as were the Solomon Island witnesses. The jury could not agree on a verdict and were discharged. Mr Whittal’s evidence was that at a time when the appellant was living at his premises he was woken by the sound of “violent knocking and yelling and screaming” coming from the appellant’s bedroom. He said that the appellant then said to him “you know I killed her don’t you? … I killed her, Anna Verma.” Mr Whittal said that the appellant told him that he had strangled the deceased, placed the body in a bin and thrown the bin off a cliff. 
     
      
    41 When cross-examined Mr Whittal agreed that he had had a falling out with the appellant in 2002-2003 over their business arrangements. He also agreed that in his first two statements to the police he did not mention that the appellant had told him that he put the deceased’s body in a bin. Mr Whittal denied making up the appellant’s confession in order to speed up the appellant’s extradition to Australia but did agree that he wanted to do whatever he could to get the appellant out of the Solomon Islands. Mr Whittal also said that he knew that Mr Timou was awaiting trial in the Solomon Islands on a charge of conspiracy to murder the appellant. There were also suggestions, which Mr Whittal denied, that he may have concocted his evidence to assist others who were in conflict with the appellant. 
     
      
    42 Before the trial at which the appellant was convicted the prosecution had decided not to call Mr Whittal to give evidence. The trial commenced on 24 October 2007 but it is apparent that the defence knew by 17 October that Mr Whittal was not to be called. Defence counsel did not request that Mr Whittal be called. This is perhaps not surprising. At worst Mr Whittal’s evidence was damaging to the defence case. At best the credibility of Mr Whittal was low and his evidence unreliable making it of no evidentiary value to either the prosecution or the defence. 
     
      
    43 I shall refer again to Mr Whittal’s evidence when I consider the second ground of appeal.  
     
      
       
      Events preceding 2 June 2002 
       
      
    44 For a significant period during the first half of 2002 the appellant lived with Ms Vousa in Brisbane. The precise times when he was in Brisbane are not entirely clear and are not of particular significance. There was no doubt that during this period the relationship between the appellant and the deceased was under great strain. 
     
      
    45 The evidence established that the appellant left Australia on 30 April 2002 to travel to Fiji. He returned to Australia on 4 May 2002 at around 11 am. He telephoned the deceased on her mobile telephone. She said that she was out shopping. He asked her to prepare lunch but when he arrived at their home the deceased was not there. The appellant gave evidence that he then drove to Villawood because he said he needed to pass some information on to Mr Goundar (who by this time had been detained) which he had from his family in Fiji. When he arrived at Villawood he saw the deceased coming out. He said she told him that she had been visiting Mr Goundar but that Mr Goundar would not want to see him. She said that Mr Goundar knew that the appellant had informed on him to the Department of Immigration. As the appellant was driving them home they argued and the appellant allegedly struck the deceased in the face. 
     
      
    46 Some time after arriving home on 4 May 2002, the appellant and the deceased went to a service at the St Patrick’s Catholic church which was opposite their home. While they were in the church at about 6.30 pm the deceased’s mobile phone rang. The deceased left the church, followed by the appellant. The appellant was seen to come back inside the church about a minute later and place some money in the collection plate. He then went outside again and shortly afterwards a female voice was heard to cry out “call the police.” The witnesses David Gilmour, Leonard Diggins, Dallas Lewis and Neil Fenwick were present at the church service. They left the church to investigate the cry. Dallas Lewis believed he was the first of the witnesses to leave the church. He said he saw an Indian man holding an Indian woman in a “bear hug” near the car park of the church. After Lewis called out “not her mate”, the man straightened up and walked away. Each of the witnesses observed the deceased to be distressed. The police were called.  
     
      
    47 At 7.55 pm on 4 May 2002 Sergeant Kierse and Senior Constable Leslie attended Kembla Street and obtained a statement from the deceased. The appellant was not at home when the police were there, although the children were. Sergeant Kierse recorded a statement from the deceased and said she had noticeable bruising under her right eye. The police left the premises and drove around the local area looking for the appellant or his vehicle but did not see him. The police then returned to Port Kembla Police Station and at some stage that night obtained an interim Apprehended Violence Order by telephone. At 11.24 pm a message was received via police radio that the appellant had returned to Kembla Street. A short time later, the deceased entered the Port Kembla Police Station saying that the appellant was at their home with the children, and that she was scared. The police drove the deceased back to Kembla Street but when they arrived the house was locked and there was no one at home. Despite the police offering to find alternative accommodation for the deceased that night she “insisted” on staying in the house. The deceased then telephoned the police at 12.17 am and gave them the appellant’s mobile telephone number. 
     
      
    48 Sergeant Kierse notified Queensland police to look for the appellant’s vehicle with a request to stop the vehicle if it was found and to check on the condition of the children. At a later time, Sergeant Kierse was informed that the vehicle had been stopped in Queensland and the children were “okay.” When he was stopped the appellant gave Ms Vousa’s address as his destination. 
     
      
    49 Ms Rhodes said she went to Kembla Street on 5 May 2002 and stayed there with the deceased until the appellant returned from Queensland with the children on 7 May 2002.  
     
      
    50 Evidence was given at the second trial, but not in the third trial, in relation to a further allegation made by the deceased on 5 May 2002. This allegation subsequently founded the attempted murder charge of which the appellant was acquitted on 15 August 2007. At about 8.15 am on 5 May 2002 the deceased attended Port Kembla Police Station. She spoke to Senior Constable Kniepp and made a statement to him about an incident which she said had taken place in the early hours of that morning. She said that shortly after Sergeant Kierse left her at Kembla Street she went to the toilet. As she was doing this she saw the appellant inside the house. She said he grabbed her by her hair and verbally abused her because she had gone to the police. She said he then dragged her by her hair to their bedroom, sat her down on the bed, placed a hand around her neck and squeezed her throat. While he was doing this, she said he said “I’m going to kill you and everything will be finished.” She said she found it really hard to breathe. She said he then pinned her head down underneath his knee and repeated the words “I’m going to kill you and everything will be finished.” She said she could not remember what happened next but thought the appellant may have been looking through the house. She said she went to sleep and woke on the bedroom floor about 35-45 minutes later and thought he was gone. She said she lay there for a further 45 minutes, not wanting to get up in case the appellant was still there and saw her. She said she then packed some things and rang a friend before going to his house at about 2.15-2.30 am and staying the night there. The deceased said she telephoned the appellant the following morning at about 8 am and said it sounded like he was driving with the children in the car. 
     
      
    51 Senior Constable Kniepp gave evidence at the second trial that he observed injuries to the deceased’s neck area “which was scratched and red marked.” Snr Const Kniepp took a photograph of those injuries. 
     
      
    52 In her evidence at the second trial in relation to this incident Ms Rhodes said the deceased telephoned her to tell her that the appellant had strangled her and rendered her unconscious. Ms Rhodes said it was late at night when the deceased called. This evidence is inconsistent with exhibit J. The only phone calls recorded between the deceased and Ms Rhodes at this time were calls made from Ms Rhodes’ mobile telephone to the deceased’s mobile telephone at 02.12.43 (no answer) and at 02.23.43 to the Kembla Street landline (27.7 second call). The deceased did not make any telephone calls to Ms Rhodes at any time between 12.15 am (before the deceased telephoned the police with the appellant’s mobile telephone number) and 10.33.41 on 5 May 2002. 
     
      
    53 I shall return to these events when I discuss the third ground of appeal. 
     
      
    54 Ms Enirqueta Waddell gave evidence that she was employed at the Wollongong Women’s Centre as at 6 May 2002. She said the deceased and Ms Rhodes attended the centre on that day. She spoke to the deceased alone in her office. The deceased told Ms Waddell that her relationship with her de facto husband was over and that she had concerns about the children being taken by him. Ms Waddell gave the deceased some advice about the possibility of taking proceedings in the Family Court and organised an appointment for the deceased to see a local solicitor. Ms Waddell later spoke to the deceased over the phone. The deceased told Ms Waddelll that she had not seen the local solicitor because “she had a solicitor already in Sydney taking care of her.” 
     
      
    55 Mr Tyrone Phillips was a solicitor who worked for a solicitors’ firm in Wollongong. He gave evidence that the deceased and her sister attended his office on 6 May 2002, the deceased having earlier made an appointment to see him. The deceased told him that “her partner had attended her residence at Port Kembla previously” and that she wanted to commence Family Law proceedings. Mr Phillips explained the process of applying for legal aid and asked the deceased to provide social security documents to satisfy the means test “but she didn’t have that document with her at the time.” Mr Phillips explained to her that if she did not qualify for legal aid then she would need to fund the application herself. The deceased said she would return the following day and that if she did not qualify for legal aid she would instruct him privately. She told Mr Phillips that she would give him “instructions to proceed in any event.” The deceased did not return to see Mr Phillips on 7 May 2002 and he had no further contact with her. 
     
      
    56 There was no evidence of any other solicitor providing legal advice to the deceased in 2001-2002 in relation to Family Law proceedings, immigration or any other matters. 
     
      
       
      13 May 2002 
       
      
    57 On 13 May 2002 the deceased withdrew $2,000 from her bank account. 
     
      
    58 Also on this day the deceased and Ms Rhodes went to see Ms Demetra Stylianou, a Women’s Domestic Violence officer at the Wollongong Women’s Centre. The deceased did not have her children with her when she went to the Centre. Ms Stylianou said she had “a very serious conversation” with the deceased. The deceased told Ms Stylianou her husband had taken the children and that she did not know where they were although “she thought he might have gone up to Queensland.” She said she had not spoken to him. She said she was afraid of him and did not want to go home. Ms Stylianou telephoned the Department of Community Services in the presence of the deceased and notified the Department that the children were missing. She also made other telephone calls “to get information about what to do about the girls.” The deceased told Ms Stylianou that she was scared to go home so Ms Stylianou made telephone calls trying to find emergency accommodation for the deceased. Ms Stylianou said that later, but while the deceased was still sitting in her office, the deceased received a call on her mobile telephone. At the end of the telephone call, the deceased told Stylianou the caller was her husband and that he had telephoned to tell her he was bringing the children home that day. 
     
      
       
      14 May 2002 
       
      
    59 The deceased returned to see Ms Stylianou the following day, 14 May 2002, this time accompanied by Ms Rhodes and the children. They spent most of the day at the centre. The deceased gave Ms Stylianou her expired passport and the passports of her three eldest children, the youngest child only had an international travel document that was referable to the deceased’s passport. The deceased told Ms Stylianou that she feared the appellant might try to take the children from Australia and she asked Ms Stylianou to keep the passports in a safe place. The deceased also told Ms Stylianou that she had organised to stay with her children at her sister’s place. Following this visit, there was no evidence that Ms Stylianou (or any other person employed in the Centre) had any further contact with the deceased until 31 May 2002. 
     
      
       
      The AVO – 15 May 2002 
       
      
    60 On 15 May 2002 the deceased and the appellant attended Port Kembla Local Court in relation to the AVO taken out by telephone on 4-5 May 2002. Senior Constable Kevin Brown was the Domestic Violence Liaison Officer at the court. He spoke to the deceased about one week prior to 15 May in order to inform her of the court process. He saw the deceased and the appellant at the court on 15 May and spoke to them about the matter generally and the orders that were to be sought on behalf of the deceased. He spoke to the deceased and the appellant both separately and together. The deceased told Snr Const Brown she wanted the AVO dropped but Snr Const Brown informed her he was unable to do that because the police had initially taken out the order. Snr Const Brown said the deceased appeared distressed and was concerned about the children, however he agreed that the deceased at no stage during the day isolated herself from the appellant by sitting in the court’s “victim’s room” as she could have done. The appellant told Snr Const Brown there was no need to make orders because he intended leaving the relationship and moving to Queensland. However, the appellant apparently agreed to the AVO orders being made by consent. 
     
      
       
      Counselling 
       
      
    61 On 16 May 2002 the appellant attended the Salvation Army church in Wollongong and spoke to Ms Janet Wilson who was employed as the Community Program Manager. Wilson later saw the appellant and the three eldest children at a church service on 19 May 2002. She introduced the appellant to Mr Jack Holt a counsellor employed by the church. The appellant told Mr Holt he needed to see him and an appointment was organised for a counselling session the following day. During the course of this counselling session Mr Holt made some brief notes in which he recorded the appellant telling him that he had relationship difficulties, that he had once struck the deceased, that an AVO had been taken out against him and that he wanted counselling to deal with his anger. In his evidence Mr Holt accepted that it was a possibility that the appellant did not say he had struck the deceased but rather that was the AVO allegation. After this session Mr Holt made another appointment to see the appellant on 28 May 2002. 
     
      
    62 On 22 May 2002 the deceased went to the Salvation Army church and saw Ms Wilson. Ms Wilson said that after seeing the deceased and speaking to her, she realised the deceased was the appellant’s partner. Ms Wilson referred her to Mr Holt who spoke to the deceased that day. Mr Holt said the deceased appeared to be “very scared, very afraid.” After speaking to the deceased and realising that she was the appellant’s partner, Mr Holt organised for the deceased to attend the appointment with the appellant on 28 May 2002. He thought he might be able to assist them with relationship counselling to sort out “the rift in communication”. The deceased was agreeable to having a joint counselling session and said she would attend. Although the appellant attended that appointment the deceased did not. 
     
      
       
      The Red Cross 
       
      
    63 Ms Jenny Grover was employed by the Australian Red Cross in Sydney in May and June 2002 to co-ordinate the Red Cross Asylum Seekers Assistance Scheme. Ms Grover was absent from Australia at the time of the trial so her statement was read. She said she received a phone call from the deceased on either Thursday 30 or Friday 31 May 2002. She said the deceased sounded “extremely upset and worried about her situation.” She said she told the deceased she would qualify for the Red Cross scheme and made an appointment for the deceased to attend the office in Sydney on Monday 3 June 2002. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The verdict of the jury was unreasonable and cannot be supported having regard to the evidence. 
       
      
    64 The principles relevant to the consideration by this Court of a submission that a jury verdict is unreasonable are well known and need not be repeated: Norris v R [2007] NSWCCA 235; Zaphir v R [2009] NSWCCA 124 at [75]; Burrell v R [2009] NSWCCA 193. The Crown case was circumstantial requiring consideration of the combination and totality of the circumstances taken together: Burrell at [53]-[64]. 
     
      
    65 I have considered all of the evidence at the trial and the submissions made to the jury and to this Court. To my mind the Crown case was compelling. I have no doubt that the appellant was rightly convicted. There are a number of significant matters which have brought me to this conclusion. 
     
      
    66 There can be no doubt that there was an unhappy relationship between the deceased and the appellant. Although the appellant was himself in a relationship with Ms Vousa he was upset by the deceased’s relationship with Mr Goundar. Before 21 June there was evidence of the appellant having assaulted the deceased, both hitting her and dragging her by the arm. Their relationship was obviously dysfunctional. The evidence was that the appellant had told the deceased’s employer that she was working illegally, the inference being that he believed this may be a means of having her taken into detention but leaving him with the children. 
     
      
    67 However, critical to their relationship and the Crown case was the fact that the evidence pointed convincingly to the appellant becoming aware that the deceased was making plans to leave him and take the children with her. The calls made on the deceased’s mobile telephone on the Sunday morning, including one to the appellant’s work associate, which the deceased would have had no reason to make, strongly suggest that the appellant had become aware of the deceased’s intentions. 
     
      
    68 The animosity felt by the appellant toward the deceased was confirmed by the deceased’s comment to her sister when she said that the appellant had said to her “you will take my kids to Red Cross over my dead body.” 
     
      
    69 No one has seen or heard from the deceased since 2 June 2002. She was very close to her sister. They met regularly and talked daily on the telephone. The evidence indicated that the deceased was also close to her mother who lived in Fiji and with whom she spoke every second Thursday by telephone. 
     
      
    70 There was convincing evidence that the deceased was a loving mother who cared for her children. Her conversations with the Salvation Army counselling service confirmed her fears, both of the appellant and that the appellant would take her children from her. Notwithstanding the dysfunctional relationship in the household, until the weekend of 2 June the deceased had chosen not to leave her children, although she would have had every opportunity. 
     
      
    71 The explanation put forward by the defence for the deceased’s disappearance was that she had left the appellant and the children to go and live with Mr Goundar. Apart from the fact that the evidence would not support an inference that she was likely to sever all contact with her children, Mr Goundar has had no contact with the deceased and since being deported to Fiji has been living in a village with 30 to 35 of his relatives, including the appellant’s mother. 
     
      
    72 Prior to her disappearance the deceased had given Ms Stylianou, a Women’s Domestic Violence officer in the Court Assistance Scheme, her passport and the children’s passports to keep in a safe place because she feared that the appellant was going to take the girls. On Friday 31 May 2002 she rang Ms Stylianou and told her that she was coming to pick up the passports on the following Monday and intended to seek refuge from the Red Cross. She told her sister of her intentions saying to her “that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel for her.” 
     
      
    73 The deceased did not keep her appointment on the Monday, did not collect the passports and failed to meet her sister. 
     
      
    74 The Crown emphasised that if the deceased was still alive it was remarkable that no one has accessed any of her bank accounts. There is no account of her movements in any immigration records, she has not accessed any health service and has not sought any social security benefits. As it was shortly before her disappearance she said that she had no money and asked her sister to help her which she did by depositing $150 into her bank account. 
     
      
    75 The deceased’s mobile telephone records record no calls since her unsuccessful attempt to telephone Mr Goundar at 9.19 am on 2 June. Although the appellant said that he had searched for the deceased on 2 June he did not call her mobile telephone and did not seek out the assistance of the police. 
     
      
    76 There were indications in the house that the deceased had not voluntarily left. Her jewellery and handbag were found in the home and most of her everyday clothes, underwear, cosmetics and perfume remained. Her gold coloured watch was left on the microwave. The Crown emphasised, in my view rightly, that it was most unlikely that the deceased would have left without taking her watch. 
     
      
    77 Some of the things the appellant said to people after the deceased disappeared were untrue and could be used by the jury to infer he knew she was dead. He told the children he had been in church while they were in Sunday school class. In her ERISP on 6 June 2002 Patricia (aged 8 years at the time) said: “He [the appellant] went to prayer in the church”. “Um, he told us he was gunna go”. She explained: “… he’s on the third floor and we’re on the second floor.” In her ERISP on 7 June 2002 Nicole (aged 7 years at the time) said that when her father picked them up he said he had been “at the church”. He told Mr Chafer, a friend of his, the same thing, stating: “I don’t know where she is, she went while I was in church”. He gave Detective Doueihi a slightly different account on 25 June stating: “I dropped the kids off at Sunday school at the Salvation Army, Wollongong, and waited outside for them until they finished.” After the appellant fled to the Solomon Islands he gave a different account in telephone conversations to Meta Jackman, a team leader with the Queensland Department of Child Safety. He said that whilst the children were in Sunday school he sat in the car listening to a tape. No tapes or CDs were found in the car when later searched by police. Nor did the car have a tape player. 
     
      
    78 After the deceased failed to meet her sister on 3 June she spoke with the appellant by telephone asking where the deceased was. The appellant replied, with what was obviously a lie, “Aruna’s got a new job and she won’t tell me where it is”, saying also that he would have the deceased contact her. At the time the appellant was travelling to Brisbane. He gave different accounts to the police in which he had suggested that the deceased had been suicidal, threatening to jump off a jetty or put herself under a train at Port Kembla railway station. 
     
      
    79 The Crown emphasised that following the deceased’s disappearance the appellant fled Sydney, left his children in Brisbane and went to the Solomon Islands. This action was not one of someone worried for the deceased’s welfare. As it happens he only returned to Australia when orders were obtained for his extradition. The deceased’s sister obtained guardianship of the children. The appellant’s sudden departure from Australia brought complete disruption to his children’s lives. It also had the consequence that he failed to keep appointments he had made for the following week. If the deceased had merely left the house, and if he believed she may not be coming back he had no rational reason to completely disrupt his own life and that of his children. 
     
      
    80 Following the deceased’s disappearance the appellant gave information to the police which was demonstrably false. I am satisfied he deliberately tried to divert attention from himself as her possible killer. By fax on 14 June 2002 sent to Port Kembla Police Station, he said “my de facto wife always leaves the house and comes home at 9 pm at night”, that he believed she “will be with one of any boyfriends”, that she “never care about the kids.” 
     
      
    81 In a telephone call on 5 July 2002 the appellant told Detective Doueihi that the deceased used a Fijian passport in the name Gamgamma Yegatsami to travel from Fiji to the Solomon Islands in 1994 and hence might now be living under a false name. (He also added in this conversation that she had another boyfriend in Sri Lanka).There were reasons why this lead from him was false. Her Fijian passport had no notation or stamp indicating she had travelled to the Solomon Islands in 1994, it listed a departure from Fiji but nothing for 1994. Her mother was not aware of her having a passport in the name of Gamgamma Yegatsami and denied the suggestion in cross-examination that members of her family called her daughter by this name. Australian immigration records had no record of anyone with the names “Yegatsami” or “Gamgamma” entering or leaving the country, no database around Australia connected the deceased to these names and the deceased leaving her Fijian passport and those of her children with Ms Stylianou for protection and safekeeping strongly indicated this was indeed her only passport. 
     
      
    82 In telephone conversations on 24 and 25 June 2002 the appellant told Detective Doueihi that on the day of the deceased’s disappearance he looked for her at Port Kembla train station because a week earlier she had rung him and told him she was going to jump off the jetty and jump in front of a train and that “I took my eldest daughter to talk to her”. The appellant claimed in evidence there were security staff at the station at the time. To Meta Jackson he claimed security personnel at the station were actually watching what was going on and that the deceased “took off her rings and put them on a chain that had been around her neck and gave them to Patricia.” However, his eldest daughter, Patricia, told police that she had never been to a train station because her mother “might have been upset or … might have tried to hurt herself” and added that she had never been given her mother’s jewellery before the time she took it all to Brisbane when her mother disappeared. As the Crown Prosecutor stated in his final address Patricia would hardly have forgotten this dramatic occasion accompanied, as it was suggested, by the histrionics of her mother and the symbolism of what she did with the necklace and ring. Police also obtained surveillance tapes for 2 June 2002 from security cameras covering the jetty and the train station. Neither the appellant, nor the maroon coloured 4-wheel drive he drove that day, nor for that matter the deceased, were pictured on those tapes. There was no reported relevant incident at the train station on 2 June 2002 or for the months before or weeks after. 
     
      
    83 Other false suggestions emanating from the appellant included his telling the detective that when he got back from church the nanny had told him “she has done with the man” and he thought now she had run off to Fiji with his cousin, Chinna Goundar. Then in February 2003 he suggested to the detective she was in New Zealand with Chinna Goundar. 
     
      
    84 The appellant submitted that the jury could neither be satisfied that the deceased was dead or if she is, that the appellant killed her. It was submitted that there were real possibilities that the deceased was pursuing a double life and had abandoned her children to go and live with Mr Goundar. In the alternative it was submitted that she may have committed suicide. To my mind neither suggestion has any substance. 
     
      
    85 There was a suggestion that one of her children may have said that their mother did not love them, only their father. It is difficult to give this any weight. This statement was apparently made after the deceased had disappeared. All of the other evidence from those who knew the family was that the deceased cared greatly for her children and their welfare, although by reason of her relatively impoverished circumstances she was required to work leaving her children in the care of Ms Assuamae. 
     
      
    86 Ms Assuamae, who apparently has only a modest command of English did give evidence that the deceased had said she was planning to leave the family. She gave the following evidence: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: Okay. And did she tell you that you had to stay with the children because she was going to go away to Fiji or somewhere? 
         
        A: Yes.” 
        
       
      
    87 Although this statement could support an inference that the deceased had intended to leave it is also consistent with her having a fear, which I am satisfied was justified that she may be deported. The trial judge took care to remind the jury of this evidence and the defence submission in her summing up. 
     
      
    88 The appellant emphasised that there were inadequacies in the evidence which it was submitted made it unlikely that the appellant had killed the deceased. There was no evidence of a struggle or blood at the Kembla Street premises. There was no evidence from any of the deceased’s clothing and there was nothing unusual about the appellant’s motor vehicle. Those who observed him on the Sunday morning did not report anything unusual about his demeanour or suggest that he was agitated. The appellant also emphasised the very limited opportunity for the appellant to dispose of the deceased’s body. It was submitted that if he had killed the deceased there was no reason to delay, as he did, his departure for Queensland. In fact he did not leave until the middle of the afternoon having previously left the premises on two occasions to go for a drive. 
     
      
    89 I accept that it is an unusual feature of this case that there is no objective evidence of the deceased’s killing. However, she could have been strangled which would not have required a weapon or left any objective evidence. I accept that although the use of the Sulo bin is possible, indeed likely, the deceased’s body could have been disposed of by other means. Although obviously requiring careful consideration neither of these matters causes me to doubt my conclusion that the appellant killed the deceased. 
     
      
    90 With respect to the appellant’s demeanour when collecting his children, if it was the case that he did not reveal any sense of agitation or concern this would not cause me to doubt my conclusion. His behaviour in leaving the house and allegedly driving around to look for the deceased was to say the least quite odd, especially when he had not tried to contact her by telephone or inform the police of his concerns. His behaviour in packing the family and that same day leaving for Brisbane and taking himself to the Solomon Islands almost as soon as he could is not consistent with a calm and rational response to the allegedly innocent circumstances. 
     
      
    91 The appellant submitted that the deceased had reasons to disappear. The relationship between her and Mr Goundar was emphasised. However, whatever the nature of that relationship, whether they were friends or intimate there is nothing to suggest that she made good an intention to leave the appellant to be with Mr Goundar. The suggestion is not supported by any evidence. It was submitted that the withdrawal of $2,000 shortly before her death and at the same time borrowing from her sister were inconsistent actions capable of supporting an argument that she had planned her own disappearance. It is true that the withdrawal of the $2,000 remains unexplained but there is nothing to suggest that it was utilised to obtain false records and leave Australia in disguise. 
     
      
    92 The appellant submitted that there was evidence that the deceased had the capacity to obtain a false passport and could have obtained an airline ticket in a false name. The records show that she made 40 telephone calls to Mr Pawar, an immigration advisor between 2 May and 20 May 2002. Mr Pawar denied speaking with the deceased or doing any work for her and it is apparent that he had no file for her. The appellant submitted that Mr Pawar was lying and lacked credibility. 
     
      
    93 To my mind the submission cannot be accepted. Mr Pawar had no apparent reason to lie and if he had dealt with the deceased would have known that the telephone records would have exposed his untruth. The likely explanation for the calls is that at the time Mr Pawar had in his office a work experience female, Ranjita Kumar who had come from Fiji. It seems probable that the deceased and Ms Kumar were friends. 
     
      
    94 The appellant submitted that the evidence established that the deceased had a propensity to tell lies. I accept that on occasions she may not have told the truth about particular matters – on occasions they may be explained as misunderstandings or that she changed her mind. However, it seems to me that whether or not she always told the truth has no bearing on the case made by the Crown against the appellant. 
     
      
    95 It was submitted that the deceased had a capacity for deception which extended to fabricating her own death in a way which would implicate the appellant as her killer. While it is obvious that the deceased had good reason to dislike the appellant and the evidence convincingly confirms that she was fearful of him and intended to leave him, there is nothing to support a theory that she was so determined to hurt him that she could organise to disappear without trace, ensuring that the appellant would be accused of her murder. 
     
      
    96 I reject ground 1 of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The appellant suffered a miscarriage of justice because the Crown did not call Anthony Whittal to give evidence in the Crown case. 
       
      
    97 I have already related the circumstances relating to Mr Whittal. By not calling Mr Whittal the prosecution denied itself evidence of an alleged confession by the appellant. However, the probative value of that evidence was not great and the calling of Mr Whittal would have required the calling of witnesses who may have cast doubt upon his testimony. 
     
      
    98 Leave to raise this ground of appeal pursuant to Rule 4 is required. 
     
      
    99 At the trial defence counsel did not ask that Mr Whittal be called and it is plain that this was a considered decision. Given that his evidence would not have been favourable to the appellant this is not surprising. Counsel for the appellant advanced a theory that the calling of Mr Whittal would have enabled an argument to be advanced of a link between Mr Whittal‘s knowledge of a confession and Mr Timou as there arguably was in relation to the confession of which Mr Kalavisiri gave evidence. 
     
      
    100 I have already indicated that to my mind the evidence of Mr Kalavisiri was of limited value. It played no part in my conclusion that the appellant was rightly convicted. Whether the calling of Mr Whittal would have assisted the appellant is entirely speculative. Defence counsel at the trial for sound forensic reasons did not ask that Mr Whittal be called. As Gleeson CJ said in TKWJ v The Queen (20020) 212 CLR 124 at [16]-[17] a rational tactical decision by counsel, even if later regretted does not produce a miscarriage of justice. To my mind the appellant is bound by the decision of his trial counsel. 
     
      
    101 I would decline leave to raise this ground of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3: The appellant suffered a miscarriage of justice because the jury were not informed of the appellant’s acquittal of the attempted murder charge on 15 August 2007. 
       
      
    102 The indictment in relation to the appellant’s second trial contained two counts, one attempted murder, the other murder. The attempted murder count related to events which allegedly occurred on 5 May 2002, the evidence for which was provided by complaints which the deceased made to various police officers including in a statement. In one of the telephone calls to the police the deceased said that the appellant had tried to strangle her. The Crown case was entirely dependent on the evidence of those complaints.  
     
      
    103 There were inconsistencies in the deceased’s version of these events as recounted by the police officers. Accordingly without evidence from the deceased herself the Crown case was not strong. Whether or not the deceased fabricated the events and for that reason the jury did not accept the evidence and acquitted the appellant cannot, of course, be determined. 
     
      
    104 At the appellant’s third trial no mention was made of this count, the events to which it allegedly relates or the fact that the appellant was acquitted of it. Defence counsel, who obviously knew about the matter did not suggest that it should be raised. It is now submitted that by not raising the matter the appellant’s trial was unfair. The argument presented to this Court was that if told of the acquittal by the jury at the second trial, the jury at the third trial would have been aware that a jury had not been satisfied that the deceased’s complaints had always been truthful, weakening the Crown case in relation to the murder count insofar as it depended on evidence of the deceased’s complaints about the appellant’s conduct toward her. 
     
      
    105 To my mind the argument has no substance. If the issue had been raised, evidence about it would have to have been given. Even if a jury could not be satisfied that the appellant had attempted to murder the deceased, raising the issue would have added substance to the Crown case that the deceased was afraid of the appellant and was planning to leave him, knowledge of which had alarmed the appellant. Irrespective of the truth of the allegation of attempted murder, there was significant and undoubtedly credible evidence indicating that the appellant had mistreated the deceased. The suggestion that her series of complaints and the making of arrangements to seek refuge with the children were borne of some irrational response, without justification in the conduct of the appellant is untenable. Others had witnessed the appellant’s violence toward the deceased. 
     
      
    106 Even if, as the appellant’s argument must be, the appellant had not conducted himself in a manner which could justify the deceased leaving with the children the evidence is uncontradicted that she intended to do this and made arrangements accordingly. The Crown case was that it was knowledge of the deceased’s intentions which motivated the killing. In these circumstances whether the deceased was a person who was prone to making false allegations about the appellant is not to the point. 
     
      
    107 To my mind trial counsel made a wise tactical decision and the appellant is bound by it. 
     
      
    108 There is a further matter relevant to this ground of appeal. During the course of his final address the Crown prosecutor explored a possible motive for the appellant to have killed the deceased. It was an alternative to the main Crown case that the appellant had acted to stop the deceased leaving him with his children. The Crown prosecutor suggested that the appellant may have killed the deceased to avoid her making false complaints about his conduct to the police. The prosecutor said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown can’t identify to you the particular act that the accused did that caused [the deceased’s] death. However, if you accept that he killed her, then an act was done by him which caused that result. It is furthermore the Crown case that when he [returned] to 40 Kembla Street, after he dropped the children off, that he did that act with the intention of killing [the deceased]. 
        
       
       
        
        I say that for these reasons. He has told you on his oath that [the deceased] was somebody who had made false complaints about him. He tells you that the complaint about the assault on 4 May was a fabrication. So what he is in effect telling you is that this is somebody who I knew would make up stories about me, would tell the police that I had done things to [the deceased] even though I hadn’t. If he had gone back to that house with the intention of assaulting her, or in a minor way of injuring her in some other way, he would have known without a shadow of doubt that she would have gone to the police. For him, it was all or nothing. He either did nothing about it, or he did the ultimate about it. He had a problem. He had a problem that he had to deal with on that day, otherwise there was a great deal at stake for him. It was a problem that for him needed a permanent solution. He obtained that solution by murdering [the deceased] on the morning of 2 June 2002.” 
        
       
      
    109 The appellant submitted to this Court that this submission was unfair. Without evidence that a previous jury had acquitted the appellant of the attempted murder charge, it being submitted that that jury must have been satisfied that she had a propensity to fabricate allegations against him, the appellant was deprived of the opportunity of effectively responding to the Crown’s submissions. 
     
      
    110 The Crown submission was of little weight, but to my mind the appellant’s argument is entirely without substance. Apart from the potential prejudice to the appellant if the evidence of the attempted murder had been led, which I have already discussed, accepting the appellant’s argument that the evidence would have added support to the proposition that the deceased was prepared to fabricate allegations against him, the effect would have been to lend support to the prosecution argument that he had killed her to avoid a false allegation being made about him to the police. 
     
      
    111 I would refuse leave to raise ground 3 of the grounds of appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 4: the appellant suffered a miscarriage of justice because, in the absence of evidence, the jury was effectively invited to speculate on the significance of exhibit S. 
       
      
    112 No point was taken in relation to this issue at the trial and leave pursuant to Rule 4 is required. I would refuse that leave. 
     
      
    113 Exhibit S was tendered, without objection by the Crown. It was a map showing a radius of 20 minutes driving from Kembla Street with the location of mine and quarry sites within the area marked by 26 red crosses with white borders. Its purpose was to demonstrate the possible distances the appellant could have driven before he collected the children after Sunday school, or on one of his two drives from the house later that morning and early afternoon. The Crown tendered other maps showing the distance from Kembla Street which the appellant could have travelled in 5, 10, 15 and 20 minutes. 
     
      
    114 Apart from providing evidence that it may have been possible to dispose of the deceased’s body at a site within 20 minutes drive of the house, the exhibit had no significance. It was not suggested that any particular site was utilised. 
     
      
    115 The exhibit played little if any part in the trial, neither counsel referred to it in addresses. It merely demonstrated that there were sites within a twenty minute radius where a body could be disposed of. It was suggested in the appeal that the tender of the map was highly prejudicial to the appellant because it invited the jury to speculate that the deceased’s body must have been disposed of at one of the sites. 
     
      
    116 It is apparent that if the appellant killed the deceased and I am satisfied that he did, her body must have been disposed of at some location. Even without the map the jury would have to have made that assumption. 
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    117 In my judgment the appeal should be dismissed. 
     
      
    118 HOWIE J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    119 JOHNSON J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.

      SENTENCE 
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Jeremy was born at Campbelltown on 22 May 2006. He died at the age of 4 ½ months on 3 October 2006. The cause of death was blunt force head injury. Clifford George Shepherd is Jeremy’s father. He was charged with murder. On 9 November 2009, the day of his trial, he pleaded not guilty to murder but guilty to manslaughter. The Crown accepted that plea in full satisfaction of the indictment. 2 The maximum penalty for manslaughter is imprisonment for 25 years.3 When I heard and received evidence and submissions on sentence on 26 February 2010 I made an order pursuant to s 15E(5) Children’s (Criminal Proceedings) Act 1987 consenting to the identification of the deceased child by his first name. Jeremy took his mother’s rather than his father’s surname. There are two older siblings. I was not prepared to consent to the child’s surname being published because I am unaware of what impact, if any, that may have upon those siblings.Facts4 The offender and Jeremy’s mother, Kylie, had known each other for about five years and commenced a relationship at around the time she became pregnant with Jeremy. She already had two children, AJ and JJ. After Jeremy’s birth on 22 May 2006 they all lived together as a family until Kylie died on 7 September 2006. It would appear she died of an asthma attack complicated by excessive illicit drug use. 5 Following Kylie’s death, Jeremy was placed into the care of the offender, whilst the two older children were placed into the care of relatives of their mother.6 The offender did not want to return to live in the house where the family had lived after Kylie died so he and Jeremy moved around staying at the homes of various friends. They had lived in the home at Minto in which Jeremy died for about a week. The two slept in the same bedroom. A cot was available but it had a part missing and so the offender took Jeremy into bed to sleep with him.7 On 27 September 2006 the Department of Community Services received a report regarding the offender’s handling of Jeremy. It was claimed that when patting the child on the back to bring up wind the offender was hitting Jeremy too hard. The offender was required to attend a meeting and to present Jeremy for preliminary examination. After that examination, departmental staff indicated that the offender could continue to have the care of the child on certain conditions. In conformity with one of those conditions, the offender took the child to a local doctor who examined Jeremy, administered certain immunisations and provided a referral to a paediatrician in relation to wheezing by the child. It would appear that Jeremy had experienced some difficulties with breathing on occasions.8 Ambulance officers were despatched to the Minto home shortly after 6am on 3 October 2006 following a tripe 0 emergency call. Ambulance staff were despatched to the address at Minto at which the offender and Jeremy had been staying. They found one of the residents administering CPR to Jeremy. It was reported that he had not been breathing for some time. He was taken to Campbelltown Hospital where he was placed on life support but later died.9 An autopsy was conducted at the Westmead morgue on 5 October 2006. Police were called in and an investigation commenced. They interviewed the offender later that day.10 The offender told police that at about 1am on the night of 2/3 October 2006 he was woken by Jeremy who he observed had become stiff and had ceased breathing. He said that he rolled Jeremy onto his side and patted him on the back. He continued doing that for about five minutes after which time Jeremy appeared to relax and resume normal breathing. He said the child then began screaming and so he fed him a bottle of milk, after which the boy returned to sleep. 11 The offender said that about 6am the child again suddenly went stiff and held his breath. He said the child’s eyes were rolling back in his head and those symptoms did not abate. He raised the alarm with other members of the household who attempted CPR while they awaited for the arrival of an ambulance. 12 The offender said that there had been three occasions in the past when Jeremy had held his breath and had his arms and legs outstretched and stiff. He also told police that on an occasion between 7 and 21 September 2006 Jeremy had hit his head on the wooden frame of a lounge upon which the offender had placed him whilst changing a nappy. He said that while the child had cried for a period of time he had thereafter appeared normal and so the offender did not think it was necessary to seek medical attention.13 The offender also stated in the interview that following the death of Kylie, he had relied heavily upon Jeremy as his only remaining family and would not allow him out of his sight. He said that the Department of Community Services wanted to take Jeremy from him but that he had pleaded with them to retain custody.14 The offender had not sought any medical attention in relation to the “fits” that he claimed that Jeremy had experienced. He told the police, “it went on for five minutes and (then) it was alright … for the rest of the night”. He said, however, that he had planned to take Jeremy to a paediatrician on the day that he had died, this being pursuant to a referral by the general practitioner that he had recently seen. 15 The offender provided no explanation for Jeremy’s death, other than that it might have had something to do with the immunisations that had recently been administered.16 It was not until August 2007 that police received the final autopsy report in relation to the death. That report disclosed that the cause of death was blunt force head injury occasioned to the child in the hours leading up to his death. Evidence of that injury included bleeding to each of the layers of the child’s eyes. Forensic pathologists located significant brain injuries. Some of those injuries were occasioned to Jeremy within hours of his death and others within days of his death. Others occurred sometime within weeks or perhaps months of his death and it is common ground that these could not be attributed to the offender. It was also found that Jeremy had bruising to the stomach and two fractured ribs, some of which showed more advanced healing, not in keeping with recent injury.17 The offender was arrested on 15 August 2007. In a subsequent interview investigators attempted to explain to him the nature of the injuries identified in the autopsy report. The offender offered no explanation as to how Jeremy received the injuries but confirmed that he had sole custody of Jeremy during the period over which the more recent injuries had been inflicted. The offender was then charged and has remained in custody since.18 The statement of agreed facts that is before me does not explain what caused the blunt force head injury that was the cause of death. However, in a statement by the offender that was tendered at the sentence hearing an explanation is given that is accepted by the Crown. In that statement the offender stated that at the time Jeremy died he thought it might have been as a result of the immunisations but that he now acknowledges that this is not the case. 19 The offender stated that he loved Jeremy and was doing his best to look after him properly. He had reduced his usage of marijuana and only smoked it after Jeremy had fallen asleep at night. He said that sometimes he became frustrated when Jeremy was crying and would walk away from him. On occasions he asked other people to look after Jeremy so that he could have a break. 20 He said that he had no experience looking after babies. He recognised now that he did not know how to properly look after Jeremy but claimed that he was trying to do the right thing. People had told him that he was hitting the child’s nappy too hard when he was burping him and so he took remedial action in relation to that.21 The offender said that on the weekend before Jeremy died he had some seizures and went stiff, but because he came good again and went back to his old self after a little while he did not think it was serious. He intended to tell the paediatrician about these when he saw him.22 The offender’s statement includes that he had been told that Jeremy died from recent blunt force head injury and that this injury happened “in the days before he died”. I note that the agreed facts which were signed by the offender state that the blunt force head injury was inflicted “in the hours leading up to death”. Be that as it may, the offender goes on to state: 
     
      
       
        
        I remember that just before he died, on one of the nights while we stayed with (friends), Jeremy woke up and began crying. I picked him up, but he wouldn’t settle down and stop crying. I was feeling tired and frustrated and had to go downstairs to get him a bottle. Instead of putting him on the bed gently, I tossed (him) on to the bed. There was a pillow sitting at the top of the bed which was partly covering the bed head. I think he must have hit his head on the pillow or bed head, because when I came back from downstairs he was quiet and had stopped crying. I gave him the bottle and went to sleep. 
        
       
      
    23 The offender also stated that the only other time he could remember when he may have hurt Jeremy was an occasion when he was rough with him when putting him on the lounge to change his nappy when Jeremy hit his head on the lounge.24 The statement also includes that the offender understands and accepts that what he did was wrong. He accepts that he was too rough with Jeremy when he tossed him down and that what he did was enough to cause serious injury that caused or contributed to his death. He goes on to say that he misses Jeremy terribly and that he was all that he had. He finds it hard to believe that what he did caused the death but accepts the medical evidence and blames no one but himself. He said that if he had known more or been told more or thought more about how fragile Jeremy was, this would not have happened. He accepts that Jeremy was his responsibility and that he failed him.25 In the course of his evidence the offender acknowledged responsibility for the fractured ribs that were found on autopsy. He attributed this to squeezing Jeremy’s chest with more force than was appropriate for a child of his tender age. It was implicit in his evidence that he attributed this, in turn, to his inadequate knowledge and skill concerning the care of an infant child.Subjective features26 The offender was born in January 1975 and so he was aged 31 at the time of the offence.27 He has a criminal history which includes offences relating to drugs, stealing, assaults and driving offences. The assaults comprise two convictions for common assault in 1994, a conviction for assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 1995 (imprisonment for 12 months with non-parole period of 9 months) and assault occasioning actual bodily harm in 2005 (suspended sentence of imprisonment for three months). 28 The offender was born in Camden. He had a brother who was some 3 years older. His father left the family when he was aged two and he didn’t see him again until he was aged 16. His mother remarried at some stage but the offender reported that his stepfather and stepsiblings were violent towards both himself and his brother. There were also occasions of violence towards his mother which he did not witness until the final occasion when there was a particularly heated and violent rage after which he did not see his stepfather again.29 The family moved around a lot and he remembered once staying at a crisis centre. At the age of 13 he found his older brother hanging in a backyard shed. He tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate him. He said he never understood why his brother had killed himself and it has been a cause of enduring trauma for him.30 He continued living with his mother, alternating between her parent’s home at The Oaks and Department of Housing accommodation at Narellan. His mother experienced a stroke on two occasions. He lived with his father for about eight months after the second stroke. His mother died when he was aged 16. He returned to live with his grandparents and hasn’t seen or had any contact with his father since.31 The offender commenced a relationship with Kristy Pace in about 1995 which lasted some 18 months. They had a son who is now aged 13 and lives with his mother in Grafton. The offender has had regular contact with them since going into custody and plans on release to move close to them so that he can see more of his son.32 Since being in custody the offender has been taking a prescribed antidepressant and has been seeing a psychologist for counselling in relation to depression. He has a “limited association” classification because of the nature of the charge that he faced. He said in his evidence that he was content with this classification and that it had not prevented him from completing some courses. 33 Dr Christopher Lennings, psychologist, has reported that the offender experienced constant flashbacks and rumination about his brother’s death. It seemed to Dr Lennings that the offender has a posttraumatic stress disorder–like response. He is also of the view that the offender had developed significant psychological vulnerabilities as he emerged into his adult years as a result of all of the negative aspects of his upbringing, including insecurity, mobility, and the domestic violence at the hands of his stepfather.34 The offender was educated to midway through Year 9. He has literacy problems to the extent that he cannot obtain a driver licence because he cannot pass the licence test. His employment history comprises various positions of unskilled labouring.35 He commenced using both alcohol and cannabis from about the age of 14. He drank alcohol heavily but stopped around the age of 18 when he went to gaol. Since that time there has been only occasional binge drinking up until the time that his son was born. He told Dr Lennings that after Kylie died he stopped drinking completely because of his need to take care of Jeremy. He continued to use cannabis but only after Jeremy had gone to sleep.36 The offender gave to Dr Lennings essentially the same explanation for Jeremy’s death as was set out in his written statement. He described Jeremy waking up crying and he realised that he needed to give him a bottle. He was tired, sleep deprived and somewhat frustrated. He threw Jeremy on to the bed as he had done on other occasions. Dr Lennings noted that the child had a couple of seizures the morning after the incident occurred and says that the offender did not realise the gravity of the situation and respond more quickly to it. Dr Lennings states that such tardiness further reflects on the offender’s poor parenting skills.37 The offender told Dr Lennings that he was just trying to struggle through as a father. He was trying to keep Jeremy out of DOCS care as he had deep suspicion of what happens to children once they are in the child welfare system. 38 He told Dr Lennings of his feelings of depression in the context of continued rumination over his brother’s death compounded by the death of his son. Dr Lennings’ opinion was that the offender satisfied the criteria for Major Depression. He felt that this depression was long term and as a residual condition from what was probably a posttraumatic like disorder associated with the suicide of his brother in his early adolescence. Dr Lennings described the offender as a psychologically vulnerable man who had failed to achieve a good level of function for any consistent period in his adult years.39 Towards the end of Dr Lennings’ report there appears the following: 
     
      
       
        
        The death of Jeremy appears to have been unintended but also reflect(ed) the absence of parenting skill. The contribution of his own childhood and life experiences towards problems in managing impulsivity and irritability seem manifest in the offence. His lack of parenting skill is a reflection of his own most difficult life, lack of appropriate parenting models and little support. His suspicion of DoCS was unfortunate in that it removed a potential support from him. Mr Shepherd does report extreme remorse for his son’s death and there is no doubt that he is severely disturbed by what has occurred. Jeremy’s death compounds the other deaths that have been significant in his life. 
        
       
      
    40 Included in Dr Lennings’ recommendations are that the offender would benefit from programs whilst in custody such as anger management and those aimed at improving control over impulsive behaviour and developing consequential thinking. He also recommended that the offender seek psychological support to work through the many losses he has experienced through his life although the doctor acknowledged that that would be difficult in a custodial environment. Sentence considerations41 It is well recognised that manslaughter is an offence which can be committed in a wide range of circumstances with an equally wide range of degrees of culpability. However, as was accepted by senior counsel for the offender, the starting point is a consideration of the objective seriousness of the offence. A key part of that is to acknowledge that manslaughter constitutes the unlawful taking of a human life. It is the responsibility of the courts to protect and preserve human life and to punish those who unlawfully take it. (See R v Blacklidge, unreported, 12 December 1995 NSWCCA; R v Dawes [2004] NSWCCA 363; and R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377; 160 A Crim R 1).42 The courts have always regarded assaults by parents upon little children resulting in death as grave and serious cases of manslaughter: per Lee CJ at CL in R v Vaughan 1991 56 A Crim R 355 at 359. 43 I was referred to the judgment of Hidden J in Leach v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 73. There his Honour in turn gave consideration to the judgment of Wood CJ at CL in R v Woodland [2001] NSWSC 416 and that of Spigelman CJ in R v Hoerler [2004] NSWCCA 184; 147 A Crim R 520. I particularly note the analysis by Hidden J of the range of sentences that had been imposed in the various cases referred to in those judgments. However I also note that in Hoerler, Spigelman CJ noted that “child killing by a parent or carer does not occur so frequently to make it possible to deduce a sentencing pattern from past cases”. He went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        [42] Plainly a violent attack, albeit not one accompanied by an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm, by a person in a position of trust and responsibility upon a defenceless young child, is a circumstance of considerable aggravation. … It is a circumstance of such significance that it is entitled to substantial weight in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. The sense of outrage in the community about such a case is so strong that the element of retribution must play a prominent part in the exercise of the sentencing discretion. 
        
       
      
    44 Hoerler clearly was a case which involved “a violent attack”. The same cannot be said about the circumstances of the killing in the present case. Factors relevant to the assessment of the objective gravity of the offence in the present case include: 
     
      
       
        
        · A very young life was taken; 
         
        · by his father; 
         
        · who stood in a position of trust; and 
         
        · in circumstances where the act was spontaneous and without any thought of the consequences 
        
       
      
    45 I am not satisfied that the offender was aware that his act was dangerous. However, by his plea, the offender acknowledges that a reasonable person would have appreciated that the act was one, which in the circumstances, exposed the child to the risk of serious injury. In all of these circumstances I would assess the objective seriousness of the offence as being in the lower range.46 Other matters relevant to the assessment of sentence include the following.47 The offender pleaded guilty on the day of his trial. The Crown and the Court were put on notice of the proposed plea at some stage during the previous week. I propose to reflect the utilitarian value of this plea by reducing the sentence I would otherwise have imposed by one eighth.48 The offender’s criminal history denies to him the leniency that would otherwise be extended to a person without such a history. That is the extent of its significance. 49 I am satisfied that the offender has good prospects of rehabilitation and is unlikely to re-offend. I am moved to make those findings in his favour because I am also satisfied that he is so remorseful over what he now acknowledges that he did that I believe the very strong likelihood is that he will be haunted by the thought of it for the rest of his life. 50 The offender’s remorse is evident from his plea of guilty, which was entered in circumstances in which there was, I accept, an area of uncertainty in terms of the expert evidence as to the precise cause and mechanism of death. It is also evident from what the offender said in his consultation with Dr Lennings, in the written statement that was tendered to the Court, and in the oral evidence that he gave before me last Friday.51 I am satisfied that there are special circumstances in this case warranting a longer parole period than would be the case if statutory proportions were maintained. The offender has the various psychological issues and vulnerabilities described by Dr Lennings and it would of benefit if there were to be a longer period of parole supervision to assist him to re-establish a stable and law-abiding life in the community.Sentence52 Convicted. 
     
      
      Sentenced to imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 4 years 6 months and a balance of the term of the sentence of 2 years 6 months. The sentence is to date from 15 August 2007 and the offender will be eligible for release on parole on the expiration of the non-parole period on 14 February 2012. The total sentence will expire on 14 August 2014.

      • Exhibit G – Bundle of documents from Justice Health. 
      
    5 The Crown also called two lay witnesses, Mr Patrick Dennis and Mr Howard Dennis. They were both present in the house at Bathurst where the child died on 28 July 2005. 
     
      
    6 On the latter date, the accused’s baby, Zane, was found lying face down in water in the bathtub located in the bathroom. Mr Howard Dennis reported the discovery of the baby to police shortly at or about 12.45 pm on 28 July 2005. 
     
      
    7 The Crown called the following medical witnesses:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Professor David M Greenberg, forensic psychiatrist. Professor Greenberg’s report dated 8 July 2009 was tendered in evidence and formed part of Exhibit B (tab 39). 
       
       
      (2) Professor Peter Stephen Joseph Ellis, regional forensic pathologist, Queensland Health Forensic and Scientific Services. 
       
       
      (3) Professor Roger William Byard, senior specialist forensic pathologist, Forensic Science (Adelaide). 
       
       
      (4) Dr Martin Patfield, consultant psychiatrist. 
       
      
    8 Ms L Wells SC, for the accused, called Dr Bruce Westmore, clinical forensic psychiatrist. 
     
      
    9 The accused, her two year old daughter and baby Zane had arrived at premises located in Rocket Street, Bathurst (“the premises”) on 27 July 2005. 
     
      
    10 Police received a call at Bathurst Police Station at about 12.46 pm on 28 July 2005. When they arrived at about 12.49 pm, two ambulances were parked outside the premises which comprised a fibro clad semi-detached house. 
     
      
    11 Police found the front door locked and heard a female voice talking and sobbing coming from inside the house. They noticed someone on it under a blanket and heard the sound of crying coming from the area of the bed. 
     
      
       
      (3) FACTS 
       
      
    12 The Crown case was that the accused and her children arrived at the home of Howard Dennis on 27 July 2005 with her young daughter and baby. 
     
      
    13 After she arrived, she was noted to be behaving in a bizarre manner which Howard Dennis described as her being “schizo”. 
     
      
    14 On the morning of 28 July 2005, the accused was still exhibiting bizarre behaviour. At some point in the morning after the baby went to sleep, Howard and Patrick Dennis left the house to go to the shopping centre at Kelso. 
     
      
    15 The evidence is uncertain as to when they left and how long they were absent from the house. 
     
      
    16 It is clear that when they left, the only adult in the house was the accused.  
     
      
    17 The evidence would tend to indicate that they were absent from the house for up to about one and a half hours. On returning to the home, Howard Dennis knocked on the door and heard the accused calling out “who is it?”. He opened the doors with his keys, and on entering the house, noted that taps were running and there was water all over the floor. After going to the kitchen, he then went to the bathroom and saw the baby in the bathtub which had water in it. He said he grabbed the baby and took him out to the lounge room and the accused then took the baby from him. He said he was shocked and rang the emergency 000 number. 
     
      
    18 When interviewed by police on 28 July 2005, Howard Dennis said when he saw the baby in the bathtub that the skin was “real loose and pale”. When asked which way the head of the baby was facing in the bath, he said “Straight into the sink” (Q.389). He said there was no plug in the sink hole and that the baby’s head went down to the sink. 
     
      
    19 A number of photographs of the house were taken by police and, in particular, of the bathroom, the bath and the sink (photographs 42 to 44, Tab 2, Exhibit A). 
     
      
    20 The facts relied upon by the Crown in this respect, which it contended established beyond reasonable doubt that the death of the child was caused by the actions of the accused, included the following:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That, at the time of his death, the child was only five weeks of age. 
       
       
      (2) The evidence that when Howard and Patrick Dennis left the premises the child was, at that point, seen alive. 
       
       
      (3) That the four year old girl who was present was physically incapable of lifting the child into the bathtub, a matter that was not disputed. 
       
       
      (4) That the only adult person in the premises after the departure of Howard and Patrick Dennis was the accused. 
       
       
      (5) That when Howard Dennis left the premises, the taps over the bath were not running. 
       
       
      (6) When Ms Cronin from the Bathurst Community Health Centre attended the premises shortly after 10.40 am on 28 July 2005, she knocked on the door. There was no answer. She could hear water running inside the house. She knocked again, harder than the first time and she heard what she described as an  
      “unfriendly female voice” 
       inside the house ask  
      “Who is it?” 
      . 
       
       
      (7) The evidence of Howard Dennis that, when he returned to the house and entered the bathroom, he saw the baby facing down in the bath near the plughole, the water still running. 
       
       
      (8) The evidence as to three telephone calls being made to the premises from a phone box in Kelso by Howard Dennis between 11.04.22 am and 11.39.13 am on 28 July 2005. 
       
       
      (9) The evidence of Howard Dennis was that he spoke to the accused who said  
      “… sorry you have to come home” 
      . She then hung up. Mr Dennis said he knew  
      “something was going on” 
      . 
       
       
      (10) The fact that child had no visible signs of injury. 
       
       
      (11) That, on post-mortem:- 
       
       
        
        (a) no external injuries were observed; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the lungs were rather congested and airless; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) cause of death could not be determined, but that the post-mortem examination could and did not exclude drowning. 
        
       
       
      (4) THE MATTERS RELIED UPON BY THE ACCUSED 
       
      
    21 The case for the accused raised two alternative grounds. First, that the Crown had failed to discharge the onus upon it to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the death of the victim was caused by an act or omission of the accused. In this respect, it was contended that the Crown had not excluded as a reasonable inference said to have been open on the evidence that the infant death was the result of supervening circumstances such as Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) or accidental circumstances including suffocation. 
     
      
    22 Second, and in the alternative, that the accused had a defence of mental illness. 
     
      
       
      (5) MEDICAL EVIDENCE 
       
      
    23 In undertaking a medical assessment in a case such as the present, the examining medical expert looks to establishing the accused’s medical history being one that is truthful and accurate. Doctors normally seek corroboration of the history or aspects of it, as for example, complaints to others of visual and auditory hallucinations. I turn to the medical evidence in this case. 
     
      
       
      (a) Professor Greenberg 
       
      
    24 The accused’s personal and family history as recorded in the reports of Professor Greenberg and Dr Westmore indicates that she had a turbulent and, at times, a violent family background. The history includes episodes of sexual abuse and the use of illicit substances from her teenage years including intravenous amphetamines and heroin amongst other substances. By the age of 24 years she reported having four children all of which were removed by the Department of Community Affairs as she was unable to care for them. 
     
      
    25 Before the birth of her son, Zane, it is reported that she had episodes of drug induced psychosis and withdrawal seizures from illicit substances. During her adolescence, she was reviewed by a psychiatrist in Bathurst who reportedly diagnosed her with depression and post-traumatic stress disorder secondary to a history of abuse. Professor Greenberg stated that because of the accused’s chronic and persistent use of illicit substances, she would qualify for the diagnosis of polysubstance abuse/dependence and that she probably had episodes of drug-induced psychosis. 
     
      
    26 On clinical assessment and review of documentation sent to him, Professor Greenberg was of the opinion that at the time of the incident the accused was suffering from drug-induced psychosis. He considered her to be a woman of limited intelligence and, at the time of the alleged offence, she was suffering from a psychotic mental illness, namely, a disease of the mind precipitated by the voluntary use of intravenous amphetamines and smoking cannabis. He considered that the psychotic illness continued over several days after the alleged offence. 
     
      
    27 Professor Greenberg also considered that the accused probably had a defect of reason at that the time of the events on 28 July 2005. On the information before him he was of the view that the accused did not know the nature and quality of her actions at the abovementioned time due to her disease of the mind and subsequent defect of reason. He was of the opinion that she probably had a defence of mental illness. 
     
      
    28 Professor Greenberg gave evidence on 4 February 2010. He stated that a person taking amphetamines would have all the symptoms of intoxication (hyperactivity):- 
     
      
       
        
        “But they don’t’ usually have hallucinations, delusions and certainly they would not last three, four, five, 10 days. They would usually resolve within 12-24 hours … but the duration and intensity of the symptoms continuing for a period of time obviously in a facility where she is not continuing to use the substances would suggest a chemical illness, namely, a psychosis even though it is drug induced in this case.” 
        
       
      
    29 Professor Greenberg, however, stated that he was not completely sure whether the accused had an underlying functional illness such as schizophrenia. In cross-examination, he agreed that, as to reported accounts by the accused of events concerning her son, he could not rely on the accused’s accounts, given that she was psychotic at the time and the prescribed medication would have affected her memory. These may also have resulted in a confused memory. He also agreed that her psychotic state would have interfered with her ability to interpret reality and, in particular, the condition of her child. Psychosis, he said, certainly will interfere in rational thinking. 
     
      
       
      (b) Dr Bruce Westmore 
       
      
    30 Dr Westmore examined the accused on 11 March 2009. In addition to information elicited at the clinical interview, he also relied upon documents sent to him relating to the accused. 
     
      
    31 Dr Westmore made a differential diagnosis, namely, a drug induced psychosis or “a primary process illness” such as schizophrenia which had been aggravated or precipitated by the use of illicit drugs. 
     
      
    32 The question as to whether the accused suffered from a drug induced psychosis or whether she had an underlying genetic or other condition that was precipitated or aggravated by a drug psychosis is a fundamental one in determining whether or not the accused has the basis for a defence in accordance with the M’Naghten Rules. 
     
      
    33 In a history taken from the accused, Dr Westmore obtained an account of the accused smoking cannabis at the age of 15 and later heroin, amphetamines and the drug known as “ice”. According to that history, she commenced using needles around the age of 17. 
     
      
    34 On mental state examination, Dr Westmore noted that the accused had a flat effect and he described “… a past and possibly current history of auditory perceptual disturbances although she did not appear to be responding to hallucinations during the assessment” (report p.5). 
     
      
    35 He stated that the accused would have been affected by the taking of illicit and prescription drugs. He was also of the view that, at the time of the alleged offence, the accused was acutely mental ill and her capacity to know or understand the wrongness of her actions, certainly from a moral perspective and perhaps from a legal perspective, were totally comprised by the presence of her mental illness. He added:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In summary, therefore, I am of the opinion that Ms Doolan was acutely mentally ill at the time her child died, she was suffering from a psychotic illness and that illness would have totally deprived her of the capacity to understand that she was not to do that act and ultimately that the act was wrong.” 
        
       
      
    36 Dr Westmore gave evidence on 4 February 2010 in the course of which he stated that the symptoms associated with a psychosis which was drug induced or a schizophrenic illness precipitated by illicit drug use were identical and that the pathological processes underlying the generation of symptoms in both conditions was identical. He stated that most drug induced psychoses were “short lived”. On the other hand, schizophrenia was a life long illness characterised by exacerbations and remissions. He added (transcript, p.105):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… If you have an underlying schizophrenic illness, or a vulnerability to develop schizophrenia, if you use illicit drugs you can precipitate an onset of the illness or aggravate a current illness.” 
        
       
      
    37 He considered that the sort of symptoms displayed by the accused from the date of the alleged offence, namely, inappropriate and bizarre behaviour, were psychotic in nature. He noted that similar symptoms had been recorded in relation to an examination when the accused was scheduled on 20 November 2001. Psychiatrists had examined her on 19 November 2001 and had noted her bizarre behaviour and she had expressed bizarre and paranoid delusions to security staff over several days. The relevant Justice Health records in relation to the latter occasion were tendered and became Exhibit 3. Dr Westmore expressed the opinion that the last-mentioned records confirmed psychotic symptoms going back to 2001.  
     
      
    38 In the normal course, he explained, such a patient is stabilised and that medication is reduced and eventually stopped. If the patient redeveloped psychotic symptoms without having re-used illicit drugs, then that would be a factor that confirms the diagnosis of schizophrenia. He said that most drug induced psychoses are transient, short-lived experiences. The longer a patient remains mentally ill after having taken drugs, the greater the index of suspicion that they have schizophrenia or an underlying vulnerability, a genetic vulnerability to that illness. 
     
      
    39 I note at this point that, in the accused’s case, the clinical observations over a period of weeks as referred to by Dr Westmore had not been undertaken. 
     
      
    40 Having regard to the earlier history in 2001, Dr Westmore stated that the clinical impression now (with her longitudinal history) would be that it was most likely that she had a schizophrenic illness which was aggravated or precipitated by illicit drugs. He was asked that if, in fact, there was no schizophrenic illness, but merely a vulnerability to drug induced psychosis, whether the mental illness defence was still available to her. He stated that he believed that it was in that the underlying pathology was the same, the chemical disturbance of the brain being identical whether it is schizophrenia or a drug induced psychosis. 
     
      
    41 Dr Westmore referred to the apparent slow recovery made over two or three months as consistent with an underlying genetic or constitutional vulnerability to schizophrenia rather than simply a drug induced psychosis. In a case of drug induced psychosis, the drugs would have disappeared at the earlier stage and slow recovery suggested vulnerability to schizophrenic illness.  
     
      
    42 In re-examination, Dr Westmore stated that persons with a genetic vulnerability seem to get worse each time they use illicit drugs. Accordingly, their chances of avoiding psychotic illness become less over time. 
     
      
       
      (c) Dr Martin Patfield 
       
      
    43 Dr Patfield, consultant psychiatrist, saw the accused during the period of her admission at Bloomfield Hospital between 29 July 2005 and 9 August 2005. The accused had been scheduled as an involuntary patient by Dr Marshall in Bathurst. 
     
      
    44 Dr Patfield said that the accused suffered from an acute psychotic illness during the period of her admission. He concluded that that illness had commenced before 28 July 2005. He said that her illness was characterised by hallucinations, delusions and irrational behaviour. 
     
      
    45 I found Dr Patfield’s evidence of particular assistance in this matter. He was taken to a report of Mr Peter G Champion, consulting clinical psychologist, dated 16 November 2001 (Exhibit 5). In that report it was stated that on the basis of the accused’s then current presentation, there was a significant possibility that she was suffering from a psychotic illness which, given the history, may have been related to drug taking. 
     
      
    46 More significantly, Dr Patfield was taken to the material which comprised Exhibit 3 and which relates to the period November 2001 in which a medical certificate was issued with respect to the accused pursuant to the Mental Health Act 1990 (Schedule 3). Dr Brown certified that on 19 November 2001, she considered that the accused was mentally ill within the meaning of the Mental Health Act and noted the accused’s then bizarre behaviour. On the basis of that certificate and Mr Champion’s examination of the accused on 14 November 2001, the accused’s mental illness had extended over a period of approximately five days. 
     
      
    47 Other records indicated that she required ongoing anti-psychotic medication on an ongoing basis through to 22 November 2001. 
     
      
    48 Dr Patfield, in relation to this past history, observed (transcript, 8 February 2010, p.132 to p.133):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… What it tells me is she has quite likely been acutely psychotic since 4 November and it’s continued over those number … of days until 19 and she, it seems, at least (was) psychotic … So all of that is typical for an acute psychosis …” 
        
       
      
    49 Dr Patfield accepted that the evidence indicated that she probably was at that time acutely psychotic over a period of three to four weeks after which it started to settle with treatment. 
     
      
    50 It is clear on that history that the applicant’s mental illness at that time was not merely a drug induced psychosis. It was Dr Patfield’s evidence that a person who becomes intoxicated with amphetamines and who becomes psychotic usually resolve over a period of one to three days. Accordingly, the history of the accused’s illness in 2001 went beyond that period and suggested that her condition was other than transitory. 
     
      
    51 Dr Patfield agreed that the history to which I have referred indicated that the accused then suffered from a significant mental illness. Ms Wells put to him (transcript, 8 February, p.134):- 
     
      
       
        
        “It is quite a different thing to compare to say a two or three day drug psychosis, or a psychosis induced by drug use that just goes away without treatment and so in, this is much more significant in terms of a mental illness? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. And bearing in mind that this incident and later history about which you know from your own observations in 2005 and the subsequent recurrence of her illness. Does that not indicate to you a vulnerability to psychosis of some kind? A. Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. Triggered by something, we know not what precisely? A. Absolutely.” 
        
       
      
    52 The fact that the accused was scheduled for a two week period in 2007 with severe disturbances of mood and having been noted as unpredictable, irritable and hostile, in Dr Patfield’s opinion was evidence of a further episode of severe psychosis. He agreed, taking into account both the pre-2005 and post-2005 medical history, that the accused had a vulnerability to developing a psychosis. Vulnerability to psychotic episodes, he stated, could arise from schizophrenia or from amphetamine use. Some people, he explained, are particularly sensitive to the psychogenic effects of amphetamines whilst others are quite resilient. 
     
      
    53 The accused’s developmental history, which included many years of abuse, neglect and chaos, according to Dr Patfield, constitute circumstances that give rise to instability. Persons with a background of that kind are more likely to become psychotic. 
     
      
    54 Dr Patfield said that an additional factor in the accused’s case concerned the fact that her former partner was due to be released from prison and on the history a good deal of her thinking around the time of the alleged offence centred on that fact. Dr Patfield considered that that matter had given rise to a fear in the accused about his release. Episodes of illness with people with schizophrenia, he said, are often related to emotional stress. He said in evidence (transcript, p.143):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… I suspect personally that it was the coalescence of a number of factors, the taking of speed, the terrifying fear of her de facto being released, she was at a period of … dislocation, not having … housing (and) … although that was common to her, it was a particularly stressful time for her and I suspected all of these things coming together meant that with this use of speed, she became frankly psychotic.” 
        
       
      
    55 He considered that such factors, quite apart from amphetamine use, indicated that there was a vulnerability in the accused to psychosis. I will return to the medical evidence, as necessary, depending upon the conclusion as to causation. 
     
      
       
      (6) EVIDENCE OF CAUSATION 
       
      
    56 It is necessary to consider the Crown case on causation. Depending upon the finding made in that respect, I will, as I have indicated, as necessary, deal with the defence of mental illness. 
     
      
    57 Professor Peter Ellis, Regional Forensic Pathologist, gave evidence as to the following matters:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That he had conducted a post-mortem examination on the body of the deceased. 
       
       
      (2) That he had prepared the report dated 23 November 2005 which accurately set out his findings. 
       
       
      (3) That most children the age of the deceased would have had difficulty in rolling over by itself. That is relevant to the position of the baby once placed in the water in the bathtub if that is what the evidence establishes. 
       
       
      (4) That the absence of physical findings or observations pointing to the cause of death meant, in practical terms, that one was required to look to the circumstances surrounding death, that is to say, the situation in which death appears to have occurred. 
       
       
      (5) The fact that the lungs of the deceased did not appear to have an increased quantity of fluid was not particularly helpful as a significant number of infants and others who drown do not actually breathe water into the lungs. 
       
       
      (6) That the attempted resuscitation of the deceased by repeated compression of the chest and perhaps the abdomen, could expel some water that is breathed in. 
       
       
      (7) That there were no signs of bruising or bumps or of movement of the brain consistent with the baby having been dropped into a ceramic bath. 
       
      
    58 In cross-examination, Professor Ellis stated:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That in a case where there are no positive findings, a number of medical and other conditions may relate to death. These included:- 
       
       
        
        • Abnormalities of the heart. 
        
       
       
        
        • Some metabolic abnormalities. 
        
       
       
        
        • Suffocation. 
        
       
       
      (2) In relation to SIDS, he stated that, in order for the syndrome to be a possible cause of death, it would require that the death occurred whilst the infant was sleeping and to die suddenly during sleep. 
       
       
      (3) Accordingly, the circumstances surrounding death were paramount in cases where there are no positive findings. 
       
      
    59 Professor Roger Byard prepared a report dated 1 July 2007 on the possible causes of death in this case. He, inter alia, is Consultant Paediatric Forensic Pathologist to the Child Protection Unit at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Adelaide. 
     
      
    60 He concluded that, in the present case, there were no signs of wrinkling of the skin or frothy fluid in the airways or wetness of the lungs at autopsy. In other words, there were no findings at autopsy to support the diagnosis of drowning. Professor Byard then added (at pp.5 - 6):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… However, given the difficulties in establishing a diagnosis of drowning that I have outlined above, the autopsy findings certainly do not exclude this diagnosis. I would therefore, agree with Dr Ellis that if the alleged history of being found ‘lifeless in a bath full of water’ is correct, then the cause of death is most appropriately left as ‘Undetermined, consistent with drowning’. However, it is not possible from the pathology to determine whether such an event was accidental or inflicted, or how he came to be in the bath. Similarly it is not possible from the pathology and information provided to exclude prior suffocation, with the body then placed in the bath to simulate drowning. Finally, there was no evidence of underlying organic disease or other injuries that could have caused or contributed to death and toxicological studies were unremarkable. Examination of histology slides did not reveal any additional significant information.” 
        
       
      
    61 In cross-examination, Ms Wells, on behalf of the accused, raised a number of matters concerning the possibility of SIDS being the cause of death in the present case. 
     
      
    62 He was asked, leaving to one side the circumstance in the present case of drowning, the child having been found face down in the water, as to what other possible causes of death may exist where there was no sign of injury or any other physical detriment. Professor Byard replied that there were a number of different disorders that may present in that way. SIDS, he stated, presented with no pathological findings. 
     
      
    63 Professor Byard had been a medical advisor to the organisation known as SIDS and Kids since 1991. That organisation was started by parents who had lost children to SIDS. He had given evidence in relation to five cases of death of children in South Australia whilst sleeping with a parent or grandparent (referred to as “co-sleeping”). 
     
      
    64 He agreed with the statement that babies were most at risk of SIDS or sleeping accidents when co-sleeping and being infants who are less than four months old and babies who are born early, premature or small. Additionally, that there is a very high risk of infant death and sleeping accidents where the baby shares a sofa or couch with an adult during sleep. 
     
      
    65 He also agreed that sleeping with a person who is a smoker is a SIDS risk factor, although the reason is not exactly known. He stated that there were increased risks of respiratory infections and asthma in children exposed to cigarette smoke. The extent of the risk varied with the extent of exposure. 
     
      
    66 Professor Byard also identified other risk factors in relation to SIDS deaths. These included:- 
     
      
       
      • Where there was adult bedding, quilts, doonas or pillows that might cover the baby. 
       
       
      • The possibility of suffocation resulting from babies that re-breathe exhaled air. 
       
       
      • Where a baby is wedged between a wall and a bed. 
       
       
      • Where a parent is affected by alcohol or drugs that cause sedation. 
       
      
    67 Professsor Byard agreed that male infants were one and a half times more likely to die from SIDS than female infants and that the most at risk age groups are infants aged one to three months. He also agreed that Indigenous families have a much higher incidence of unexpected infant death, whether due to SIDS, infections or other problems.  
     
      
       
      (7) THE CAUSATION ISSUE  
       
       
      (a) Crown submissions 
       
      
    68 The primary basis of the Crown case was that the child died by drowning after it was placed into the bath by the accused and that, at that time, it was face down with water running into the bath. 
     
      
    69 In his opening address, the Crown Prosecutor stated that the accused intended the child would drown, albeit, it may have been in accordance with instructions given to her by the child and the Lord, as she saw it. 
     
      
    70 Alternatively, the Crown stated that, if I were to accept the version that she dropped the live child into the bath and left it lying face down, the child being five weeks of age, she must have been aware that if she did nothing the child would probably die and, therefore, she would be guilty of murder by reckless indifference by omission. 
     
      
    71 In his final submissions, the Crown Prosecutor stated that the Court could find beyond reasonable doubt that the deceased died as a result of the deliberate act of the accused on either one of two bases:- 
     
      
       
      (1) On the basis of evidence as to statements made by the accused to various persons after the events of 28 July 2005 including the period she spent in Bloomfield Hospital. If the Court were to determine that the accused was speaking the truth on particular occasions, then the finding as to causation could be made on the basis of the accused’s admissions. 
       
       
      (2) Alternatively, the Crown relied upon circumstantial evidence and, in that respect, the Crown relied upon the matters set out in a document which summarised aspects of the evidence that the Crown contended established causation. The Crown Prosecutor additionally submitted that the statements made by the accused to others could themselves form part of the circumstantial evidence. 
       
       
      (b) The submissions for the accused 
       
      
    72 It was submitted for the accused that there was available a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence said to be based on one of three possible causes of death:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The evidence that the deceased child’s death occurred before his body was placed in the bath and that the cause and place of death is unknown. 
       
       
      (2) That it was equally open to find that, rather than drowning the baby, the accused was trying to revive him. This submission was based on evidence raised in her admissions to police. Accordingly, it was contended that this was a possible explanation, not pure speculation. 
       
       
      (3) Evidence which pointed to possible causes of death that may arise in the absence of signs or symptoms. The first was suffocation. The second was SIDS. There was a degree of overlap between suffocation and SIDS. 
       
      
    73 Reliance was placed upon the fact that the medical pathological evidence did not exclude any particular cause or place of death, the cause of death not being able to be determined by Professor Ellis, but merely it being consistent with drowning. Ms Wells submitted that the statement that death was consistent with drowning was based on the history that the baby was found lying down in a bath full of water. 
     
      
    74 It was submitted that neither the medical evidence nor the circumstantial evidence could establish whether or not the baby was alive at the time that he was placed in the bath. 
     
      
       
      (c) Principles 
       
      
    75 When the case against an accused person rests substantially upon circumstantial evidence, a jury cannot return a verdict of guilty unless the circumstances are “such as to be inconsistent with any reasonable hypothesis other than the guilt of the accused”: Peacock v The King (1911) 13 CLR 619, 634. 
     
      
    76 To enable a jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the guilt of the accused, it is necessary not only that the accused’s guilt should be a rational inference but that it should be “the only rational inference that the circumstances would enable them to draw”: Plomp v The Queen (1963) 110 CLR 234, 252; Barca v The Queen [1975] 133 CLR 82, 104 per Gibbs, Stephen and Mason JJ. 
     
      
    77 In Barca (supra) it was also observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “However, an inference to be reasonable must rest upon something more than mere conjecture. The bare possibility of innocence should not prevent a jury from finding a prisoner guilty, if the inference of guilt is the only one open to reasonable men upon a consideration of all the facts in evidence” 
        :  
        Peacock  
        (supra) at 661. 
        
       
      
    78 Although a jury cannot be asked to engage in groundless speculation, it is not incumbent on the defence either to establish that some other inference other than that of guilt should reasonably be drawn from the evidence or to prove particular facts that would tend to support such an inference. If a jury think that the evidence as a whole is susceptible to a reasonable explanation other than that the accused committed the crime, then the accused is entitled to be acquitted: Barca (supra) at 105. 
     
      
    79 A circumstantial case depends upon two conditions having been met. First, the primary facts from which the inference of guilt is to be drawn must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. Secondly, the inference of guilt must be the only inference, which is reasonably open on all the primary facts which a jury find or, in a case such as this, the judge. 
     
      
    80 The circumstances which may be taken into account in the process of reasoning involved in a circumstantial evidence case include all facts and matters which form constituent parts or ingredients of the transaction itself or explain or make intelligible the course of conduct pursued. This would include circumstances whose relation to the fact in issue consist in the probability or increased probability judged rationally upon common experience, that would not be unless the fact to be proved also existed: Martin v Osborne (1936) 55 CLR 367, 375 per Dixon J. 
     
      
    81 It was submitted on behalf of the accused that the evidence adduced by the Crown failed to negative an hypothesis which was consistent with innocence. 
     
      
       
      (d) Facts established in the Crown case 
       
      
    82 In relation to the Crown case, the following matters were required to be established beyond reasonable doubt:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The death of the child (which was common ground). 
       
       
      (2) Whether or not the death of the child was caused by the actions of the accused by drowning him in the bath or placing him in the bath in a way that would cause him to drown. 
       
       
      (3) That, at the relevant time, the accused had an intention to kill the child or to inflict grievous bodily harm (in relation to which the accused, in this case, raises a defence of mental illness). 
       
      
    83 On the issue of causation (element (2) above), as earlier indicated, the Crown relied upon circumstantial evidence to prove that the accused caused the death of the baby by placing him in the bath with a sufficient amount of water to occasion drowning. 
     
      
    84 The Crown submitted that:- 
     
      
       
      (1) On the evidence, the only way the child could have got into the bathtub was for him to have been placed there by the accused. 
       
       
      (2) The position in which the child was found was established and was as stated in the evidence of Mr Howard Dennis. 
       
       
      (3) That a child of five weeks would not be able to roll itself over. 
       
       
      (4) There was no evidence that the child had ever been found either asleep or not breathing, a fact said to be relevant to any possibility of the child having died from SIDS or otherwise. 
       
      
    85 In support of the submission that there was available a reasonable hypothesis consistent with innocence which was not negatived to the required standard by the Crown case, Ms Wells relied upon the following:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That there was  
      “some evidence” 
       that the deceased child’s death occurred before his body was placed in the bath and that the cause of death and place of death other than it being somewhere in the house was unknown. In this respect, it was contended for the accused that it was equally open to find that, rather than drowning the baby, the accused was, in fact, trying to revive him. This was said to be based on evidence raised in  
      “admissions” 
       made by the accused to police and was not pure speculation. It was based on statements said to have been made by the accused herself. 
       
       
      (2) The medical pathological evidence did not include either the cause of death or place of death and the post-mortem finding was that the cause of death could not be determined but simply was consistent with drowning. The proposition that death was consistent with drowning was said to be based on the history that the baby was found lying down in a bath full of water. There was no affirmative finding to support the conclusion as to drowning, nor was there any evidence of any physical defect or any toxicological result that would exclude drowning. 
       
       
      (3) Neither the medical evidence nor the other circumstantial evidence relied upon by the Crown, in particular, the finding of the baby could establish whether or not the baby was alive at the time that it was placed in the bath. 
       
       
      (4) On the evidence, including in particular, the evidence of the pathologist, it was necessary for the Court to consider whether there were other causes of death other than by drowning in a case where there was no physical or toxicological signs or symptoms. 
       
       
      (5) The evidence of Professor Ellis and Professor Byard established that there were a range of alternative causes of death, being causes of death that may arise in the absence of symptoms. These were said to include:- 
       
       
        
        (a) death by suffocation; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) SIDS. 
        
       
      
    86 Ms Wells properly conceded that Professor Ellis had said in evidence that SIDS, though a possibility, qualified his evidence by adding that there would need to be evidence that the child was found in circumstances which indicated that he had died during sleep. 
     
      
    87 Ms Wells, in support of the possibility that the deceased’s death was related to SIDS, identified the risk factors said to be established in evidence. These included:- 
     
      
       
      (1) Co-sleeping with parents of siblings as related to the risk of SIDS or accidental suffocation. 
       
       
      (2) The type of sleeping surface. 
       
       
      (3) Smoking during pregnancy. 
       
       
      (4) Smoking in the presence of the child. 
       
       
      (5) That the incidents of risk are associated with winter months. 
       
      
    88 It was contended that each of the risk factors identified in the evidence were, on the evidence, applicable to the circumstances of the present case. 
     
      
       
      (e) The accused’s statements 
       
      
    89 The accused’s statement, when interviewed by police, that the child was already dead before she dropped him into the bath is to be assessed in relation to each of the interviews she gave and account taken of the varying versions and the medical evidence which indicated that her medical condition would render her unable to provide a consistent sequential account of events. 
     
      
    90 The accused was interviewed on four occasions during which she was asked to give her version of what happened. The following deals with each interview. 
     
      
       
      (i) Interview on 28 July 2005 
       
      
    91 The accused stated (question 24) “… he said, you’ll need to put me under water, you’ll drown me in it …”. She said that the Lord said to her “I need to smother me in the water”. In relation to question 32, she said “He’s in the bath, I rushed him off the bed”. She said that she was not able to say what had happened. 
     
      
       
      (ii) Interview on 9 August 2005 
       
      
    92 In the interview on 9 August 2005, the accused gave the following responses to questions:- 
     
      
       
        
        A33 “It’s just, it’s an, like an accidental death …” 
        
       
       
        
        A34 “‘Cause I know me daughter caused it all.” 
        
       
       
        
        A36 “She accidentally tipped his pram over and it’s really high.” 
        
       
       
      (iii) Interview in Cowra on 23 November 2005 
       
      
    93 In the interview on 23 November 2005, the accused stated (p.40):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… by the time I came back in my son was screaming on the floor ‘cause Elizabeth tipped the pram over. I picked up son … and I run with son ‘cause he was holding his breath ‘cause Elizabeth accidentally tipped him out of the pram … I panicked and I’m trying to blow in his face and trying to make him come to ‘cause he was holding his breath and there was nothing I could do, so I ran, when I ran into bathroom, I had him like that. When I ran I slipped ... but I dropped son as well and that’s how it, it come to son having knock on his head to ‘cause I fell.”  
        
       
      
    94 In answer to question 42, she said that the baby ended up in the bathtub. 
     
      
    95 At p.43 she said, “in the bathtub, his head hit, his head went up near the plughole … I was too frightened to even grab him back out of there …”. 
     
      
    96 In the interview (p.44), the accused stated that, after the baby fell from the pram, he was “… blue around the lips … holdin’ his breath, like, holdin’, making a noise but not breathing”. 
     
      
    97 She stated that before running to the bathroom, the baby was screaming (p.54). At p.55, she said that, after he fell out of the pram, the baby was “winded”. 
     
      
    98 She stated (p.57) that she panicked and did not want to pick him up “‘cause I dropped him”. She said she did not check him after she dropped him and that “… I was too frightened to pick him up again”. 
     
      
    99 The accused stated (p.64) that she did not know whether “… I knocked him out or what when I dropped him. I, I panicked and I didn’t know what to do”. She was asked whether she checked to see whether he was breathing. The accused replied “yeah, he was breathin’, that’s why I didn’t have the shower facing him”. She repeated that the child was breathing and she determined this because “… I could see his chest still moving, you know”. 
     
      
       
      (iv) Interview on 19 December 2007 
       
      
    100 The applicant said:- 
     
      
       
        
        A9 “I said I dropped my son …”  
        (see similar answer to question 20) 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        A11 “That’s when I dropped him, he was already dead.” 
        
       
       
       Q16 “So what makes you think, he was deceased at the time?” 
       
        
        A16 “Um, well I well. I know that I was knocked out …” 
        
       
       
       A23 “I went to pick him up out of the bath.” 
       
       
       A48 “I dropped him because he was dead.” 
       
       
        
        A51 “Well, I know he wasn’t breathing, that’s why I dropped him, because he was blue.” 
        
       
      
    101 It was put to the accused at this point in the interview that she had previously said to police in Cowra that the baby was breathing. She answered “no”. 
     
      
       
      (f) Evidence as to the accused’s reliability as a historian 
       
      
    102 Professor Greenberg was of the opinion that the accused would have difficulty with remembering what occurred about the events leading to her baby’s death partly by reason of having been treated with anti-psychotic medication. Such medication, he said, affects the mind. 
     
      
    103 In his report of 1 August 2009, having seen the accused on 29 June and 5 July 2009, Professor Greenberg said that the accused was, in his view, an unreliable historian. He also agreed, when it was put to him by Ms Wells, that her psychotic condition and state of intoxication on 28 July 2005 was such that her condition would have interfered with her ability to interpret reality, including the actual condition of the baby on 28 July 2005. 
     
      
    104 Dr Westmore’s evidence as to the accused’s reliability was consistent with that of Professor Greenberg. Dr Westmore said in oral evidence that it was likely that the accused had no recollection of what occurred in relation to the death of her son. He would, however, have expected that she would have “some patchy memory” and that “the memories are likely to be confused”. He said that he thought her memory of events would be “scrambled”. He thought that the accused was an unreliable historian in relation to the events of 28 July 2005 and that “she may have false memories about what occurred …” (transcript, p.116). 
     
      
       
      (8) FACTS ESTABLISHED 
       
      
    105 The following facts were established beyond reasonable doubt:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The only adult person in the house in the two hour period prior to 12.00 pm or thereabouts on 28 July 2005 was the accused. 
       
       
      (2) When Patrick and Howard Dennis left the premises on the morning of 28 July 2005:- 
       
       
        
        (a) the baby was alive and in apparent good health; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) went to sleep on the bed in the lounge room just prior to Patrick and Howard Dennis leaving the premises that morning; 
        
       
       
        
        (c) the accused was awake at that time and still stimulated by amphetamines when Patrick and Howard Dennis left the premises; 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the accused had been consistently acting in a bizarre fashion on 27 and 28 July 2005 and on 28 July she was demonstrating an irrational state of mind; 
        
       
       
        
        (e) when Patrick and Howard Dennis returned to the house, the accused was awake. 
        
       
       
      (3) The baby was found by Howard Dennis face down in the water in the bath as he described. 
       
       
      (4) The baby was placed in the water in the bath by the accused. 
       
       
      (5) The taps were not running when Patrick and Howard Dennis left the premises. The accused was the person who turned the taps on in the bath. 
       
       
      (6) There was no direct evidence to suggest that the baby was dead before being placed in the bathwater. 
       
       
      (7) It is likely that the child was dead by 10.40 am, that is, about 90 minutes at most from when Patrick and Howard Dennis left the premises. 
       
       
      (9) CONCLUSIONS ON CAUSATION 
       
      
    106 It is clear, on the evidence, that the issue of causation cannot be determined on the basis of statements made by the accused after the events of 28 July 2005, given the evidence that little or no reliability can be placed upon them. 
     
      
    107 The medical evidence being that there was no physical sign at autopsy, in those circumstances, it is necessary for the Court to consider whether the evidence leaves open a rational basis for an hypothesis that there were other possible causes of death other than drowning. 
     
      
    108 Insofar as particular statements made by the accused might be taken as some evidence that the deceased was dead prior to him being placed or dropped into the bath, for reasons disclosed by the medical evidence to which I have referred, such statements cannot be regarded as, in any way, cogent evidence, and there is no other evidence to support the proposition, as an alternative hypothesis, that the child may have been or was dead prior to it being placed or dropped into the bath. 
     
      
    109 As to the alternative hypothesis relied upon on behalf of the accused, namely, that the evidence admits, as a rational inference, the possibility that the child died by circumstances of suffocation or SIDS or both, there is no evidence of any cogency, in my opinion, that would support that the child died whilst asleep in any such circumstances. 
     
      
    110 The evidence of Professor Byard and Dr Ellis clearly articulated risk factors that have been correlated or associated with infant death arising from that syndrome. The medical research has not established the extent of risk that arises from the existence of one or more or a combination of risk factors. Whilst risk factors may exist, it is clear, from the evidence, that it is by no means the case that such factors materialise merely by their presence or existence. In particular, in the present case, neither Dr Ellis nor Professor Byard were prepared to venture an opinion as to the likelihood or otherwise of death by the deceased through suffocation or SIDS. 
     
      
    111 I have earlier referred to the principles to be applied in determining a circumstantial evidence case and those principles, of course, are applicable on the issue of causation that has been raised in the present case. I have concluded, for reasons I have stated, that the proposition that the child may have died from suffocation or SIDS cannot be said to be any more than speculation. Accordingly, for reasons elsewhere stated, I consider that the Crown case establishes, beyond reasonable doubt, that the death of the child resulted from the acts of the accused. 
     
      
       
      (10) THE DEFENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS: COMMON LAW PRINCIPLES 
       
      
    112 I turn now to consider the defence of mental illness. 
     
      
    113 (omitted)There is no reliable evidence that supports the proposition that the accused’s baby was dead before he was placed or dropped in the bathtub. 
     
      
    114 (omitted)The account given by the deceased to police on 23 November 2005 does not constitute reliable evidence. It is not supported by and, indeed, is in material respects, in conflict with her earlier statements. Additionally, the medical evidence, including, in particular, that of Professor Greenberg and Dr Westmore, establishes plainly enough that the accused is to be regarded as an unreliable historian. 
     
      
    115 (omitted)I am, accordingly, of the opinion that there is no evidence that supports a rationale hypothesis that the child could have died prior to and from causes other than by drowning in the bathtub in which he was found with the head submerged in the manner described in evidence by Howard Dennis. 
     
      
    116 The meaning of the terms by which mental illness is defined at law is a question of law not a question to be answered by medical witnesses: The Queen v Falconer (1990) 171 CLR 30, 49 per Mason CJ, Brennan and McHugh JJ. 
     
      
    117 Generally speaking, in the area of mental illness relevant judgments make a distinction between an underlying mental infirmity which is productive of one of the prescribed effects and a transient non-recurrent mental malfunction caused by external forces which produces an incapacity to control actions. 
     
      
    118 The former is treated as unsoundness of mind or insanity. The latter is no more than a variation within the norm: Falconer (supra) at 49. 
     
      
    119 The dichotomy between mental illness and a healthy mind is discussed by King CJ in Regina v Radford (1985) 42 SASR 266 at 274 to 278 was adopted by the High Court in Falconer (supra) at 54. In Radford (supra), King CJ’s discussion of mental illness included the following points:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The terms  
      “disorder” 
       and  
      “disturbance” 
       of the mind is used by Dixon J in his charge in  
      Regina v Porter  
      (1936) 55 CLR 182 at 188 must take their colour from the word  
      “disease” 
       and refer to disorder and disturbance of the mental faculties which can be characterised as mental illness. 
       
       
      (2) A  
      temporary disorder 
       or  
      disturbance of an otherwise healthy mind caused by external factors cannot properly be regarded as disease of the mind as that expression is used in the M’Naghten Rules 
      . 
       
       
      (3) The major mental diseases or psychoses such as schizophrenia are clearly diseases of the mind. 
       
       
      (4) According to the view of Lord Denning in  
      Bratty v Attorney-General (Northern Ireland) 
       [1963] AC 386 at 412, any mental disorder which has manifested itself in violence and is  
      prone to recur 
       is a disease of the mind. 
       
       
      (5) Disease of the mind is to be distinguished from  
      “mere excitability of a normal man, passion, even stupidity, obtuseness, lack of self-control and impulsiveness” 
      :  
      Porter 
       (supra) at 188. 
       
       
      (6) The essential notion appears to be that in order to constitute insanity in the eyes of the law, the malfunction of the mental faculties called  
      “defect of reason” 
       in M’Naghten Rules,  
      must result from an underlying pathological infirmity of the mind 
      , be it of long or short duration and be it permanent or temporary, which can be properly termed mental illness, as  
      distinct from the reaction of a healthy mind to an extraordinary external stimuli 
      . 
       
      
    120 A malfunction of the mind which is prone to recur reveals an underlying pathological infirmity. 
     
      
    121 There is a significant distinction between the reaction of an unsound mind to its own delusions or to external stimuli on the one hand and the reaction of a sound mind to external stimuli on the other: Radford (supra) at 276 per King CJ. 
     
      
    122 In general terms, a recurring state which involves some abnormality will indicate a mind which is diseased or infirm, but the fundamental distinction is necessarily between those mental states which, although resulting in abnormal behaviour, are or may be experienced by normal persons and those which are never experienced by or encountered in normal persons: Falconer (supra) at 85 per Gaudron J. 
     
      
    123 In Radford (supra), King CJ distinguished between “an underlying pathological infirmity of the mind … which can be properly termed mental illness” and “the reaction of a healthy mind to extraordinary stimuli”. 
     
      
    124 In Regina v Quick [1973] 1 QB 910, Lawton LJ stated (at 922) that the fundamental concept is of a malfunctioning of the mind caused by disease:- 
     
      
       
        
        “A malfunctioning of the mind of transitory effect caused by the application to the body of some external factor such as violence, drugs, including anaesthetics, alcohol and hypnotic influences cannot fairly be said to be due to disease. Such malfunctioning, unlike that caused by a defect of reason from disease of the mind, will not always relieve an accused from criminal responsibility. A self-induced incapacity will not excuse ( 
        Regina v Lipman 
         [1970] 1 QB 152), nor will one which could have been reasonably foreseen as a result of either doing or omitting to do something, as for example, taking alcohol against medical advice after using certain prescribed drugs … From time to time difficult border causes are likely to arise. When they do, the test suggested by the New Zealand Court of Appeal in  
        Regina v Cottle 
         [1958] NZLR 999, 1011 is likely to give the correct result, viz, can the mental condition be fairly regarded as amounting to or producing a defect of reason from disease of the mind?” 
        
       
      
    125 In Quick (supra), it was held that the accused’s mental state, if it ever existed, was not caused by his diabetes but by his use of the insulin prescribed by his doctor. Such malfunctioning of his mind as there was, was caused by an external factor and not by a bodily disorder in the nature of a disease which disturbed the working of his mind. It was held that the accused, in those circumstances, was entitled to have his defence of automatism left to the jury. 
     
      
    126 In Regina v Meddings (1966) VR 306, the accused suffered from epilepsy, a disease of the mind. He was a heavy drinker of alcohol. After drinking, without provocation, he shot his best friend several times causing him severe injuries. 
     
      
    127 Scholl J referred to Bratty (supra) in which there was evidence that the accused was suffering from psychomotor epilepsy. Scholl J considered that a point of significance in Bratty was Lord Denning’s identification of the potentiality of repetition as something which he regarded as important when dealing with the state of mental organs which were disordered and as to which the question arose whether it fell within the M’Naghten Rules. 
     
      
    128 Scholl J took the reference in Bratty (supra) to the phrase “prone to occur” as referring to the possibility of recurrence as a material factor. Scholl J added (at 309):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… Now that is what I myself in Carter’s case (supra) had ventured to think might be regarded as the discrimen between cases of irrational behaviour due to some transient cause affecting the mind, other than disease of the mind, and cases of irrational behaviour due to defective reason for disease of the mind …”  
        
       
      
    129 A little later, Scholl J continued:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… I think the question for me is whether the evidence indicates that there is, if Dr Bartholomew’s view is accepted, the element present of potential repetition of attack of the kind made by the accused man on 26 December last. I find that the element of potential repetition was regarded as relevant by Lord Denning. It was the discrimen which I sought to apply in Carter’s case …” 
        
       
      
    130 His Honour found that the evidence indicated the element of potential repetition. The medical evidence was to the effect that the epileptic fit had been triggered by the consumption of alcohol. The evidence was to the effect that, if the accused in that case had “a potential susceptibility to epileptic attacks”, such attacks could be triggered by various sets of circumstances or drugs such as alcohol. Scholl J concluded:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… If a man is liable to an epileptic attack by reason of a predisposition whether resulting from injury or some idiopathic cause, then I think it can properly be said he has a disease of the mind … There is a predisposition to, with the potentiability of repetition of, violent outbursts and whether the trigger is alcohol or whether it is surrounding circumstances, whether it is a provocative word or some object which arouses recollection or emotion, does not seem to me to matter. If, in such circumstances, there is induced an epileptic fit as a result of which automatism supervenes, then I think` it can properly be said, and ought properly to be said, that it is the result of a disease of the mind within the M’Naghten Rules. The case seems to me quite different from the case of the ordinary individual who takes too much drink and then acts, it may be, without true volition …” 
        
       
      
    131 Finally, in Regina v Jennings [2005] NSWSC 789, Kirby J observed:- 
     
      
       
        
        “30 There will be an abnormality of mind, for the purposes of this defence, where an accused's capacity to understand events or judge whether his actions were right or wrong or control himself, deviates from what may be regarded as normal, given that there is variation in the different ways in which people function. However, the abnormality of mind must arise from an underlying mental or physiological condition. It is not enough if the accused's inability is merely transitory, although it does not have to be a permanent condition.  
        
       
       
        
        31 I should, in this context, say something about the relevance of drugs and alcohol. If a person were to become psychotic by reason of drugs or alcohol, and kill someone while so affected, the partial defence would ordinarily not be available, and that because the effects of the self induced intoxication would ordinarily be short lived. The action of killing someone, while so affected, would ordinarily not be the consequence of an abnormality of mind arising from an underlying condition. Rather, on that example, the effects of the alcohol and drugs, which induced the killing, would be transitory.  
        
       
       
        
        32 On the other hand, as explained by the medical evidence given in this case, drugs or alcohol may, in certain individuals, trigger an abnormality of mind, that is, bring about some physiological or mental change which is not transitory, but remains even when the effects of the drugs or alcohol have worn off. The partial defence of substantial impairment may, in that circumstance, be open, or indeed, the  
        M'Naghten 
         defence may be available if the impairment were total.” 
        
       
       
      (11) CONCLUSIONS ON THE DEFENCE OF MENTAL ILLNESS 
       
      
    132 The voluntary ingestion of prohibited drugs, including amphetamines, in itself provides no excuse or justification for unlawful or criminal conduct which is carried out under the influence of such drugs. 
     
      
    133 In the present case, it has been necessary to give close consideration, in particular, to the medical evidence in order to determine whether or not, on 28 July 2005, the accused acted by reason of the effects of an underlying condition resulting in a mental illness at the time she killed the deceased and to separately evaluate the effects of the ingestion of amphetamines. 
     
      
    134 It is clear on the evidence that the accused was affected by the ingestion of prohibited drugs in the hours before and leading up to the death of the deceased. However, on the medical evidence, it is also clear that, at least since 2001, the accused has suffered a number of episodes of drug induced psychosis and that has given rise both to a vulnerability to further psychosis and, as well, an underlying condition independent of the effects of her drug taking on and before 28 July 2005. 
     
      
    135 The medical evidence does, accordingly, establish that, at the time she killed the deceased, she suffered from an abnormality of mind by reason of mental illness. The abnormality of mind significantly impaired the accused’s perception of events and her ability to know right from wrong. 
     
      
    136 It is clear from the medical evidence that, leaving aside the effects that the drugs had upon the accused, she could not reason with a moderate degree of composure in the state that she was in on the day the deceased died. 
     
      
    137 The medical evidence, including in particular, that of Dr Patfield, does establish the underlying condition to which I have referred from which the accused suffered, quite apart from the effect of the drugs that she had taken, whether they would have affected her capacity to reason to a very marked extent. 
     
      
    138 Apart from evidence given by Professor Greenberg, the other medical evidence does not go so far as to establish that the accused did not have sufficient awareness of what she was doing when she placed the baby in the bath containing water. However, the medical opinion in this case uniformly establishes that on the probabilities, the accused did not know that what she was doing was wrong, in that she could not reason with a moderate degree of sense and composure that what she was doing was both legally and morally wrong. 
     
      
    139 I, accordingly, conclude that the accused has available to her a defence of mental illness, in that, at the time of causing the death of her child, she did not know that what she was doing was wrong in the sense to which I have referred.  
     
      
       
      (12) PRACTICAL AND LEGAL CONSEQUENCES OF A FINDING OF NOT-GUILTY BY REASON OF MENTAL ILLNESS 
       
      
    140 The legal and practical consequences of a finding that the accused is “not guilty on the ground of mental illness” may be shortly stated. 
     
      
    141 The statute which governs cases like this, the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, requires me to make an order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law. In practice, this means not only that the accused remains in custody until a decision is made to release her, but also that she becomes what is known as a forensic patient and falls under the supervision of a body called the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  
     
      
    142 The Mental Health Review Tribunal consists of a president and his/her deputy, who must be a lawyer. It also consists of two other persons, one of whom must be a psychiatrist. The third member is a person who has suitable qualifications or experience for the task. 
     
      
    143 The Tribunal is required to review the accused’s case as soon as practicable after an order is made for her detention in strict custody. The Tribunal may make orders as to her continued detention, care or treatment, or as to her release.144 The Tribunal cannot make an order for the release of the accused unless it is satisfied that the safety of that person or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by her release. The Minister for Health and the Attorney General may appear before the Tribunal, or make submissions to the Tribunal, in relation to the possible release of the accused.  
     
      
    145 Where an order for release is not made, the Tribunal order results in continued detention, care and treatment in a place and manner specified by the Tribunal. 146 After the initial review, the Tribunal must, at least once every six months, again review the case and make orders as to the accused’s continued detention, care or treatment in a hospital, prison or other place as to her release. 147 If release is ordered, then it may be on conditions or it may be unconditionally. If any condition is breached, or where the mental condition of the accused has deteriorated so that she may be a serious danger to others, a further order may be made by the Tribunal for her apprehension, care and detention.  
     
      
    148 The conditions which could be prescribed include matters such as living in a particular place, taking particular medication, appointments with health care professionals, enrolment in educational and therapeutic programmes, to ensure that the accused is properly cared for. Other than pursuant to any such release, the accused would remain, as I have said previously, in strict custody within one of the psychiatric institutions caring for forensic patients. 
     
      
    149 Security conditions (as necessary) are in place while the accused is detained in a hospital, prison or other place or if she is allowed to be temporarily absent from the place of detention. 150 The accused may be released from these restrictions if given an unconditional release, or where released on conditions and those conditions have expired over time. However, as I have previously explained, the accused will only ever be released when the Mental Health Review Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that her safety and the safety of any member of the public will not thereby be seriously endangered. 
     
      
       
      (13) ORDERS 
       
      
    151 I am satisfied that at the time of doing the acts causing death the accused was mentally ill so as not to be responsible in law for her acts and, accordingly, I am required to return a special verdict.  
     
      
    152 Barbara Ann Doolan, upon the charge that on 28 July 2005 at Bathurst in the State of New South Wales you did murder Zane Doolan, I find that you are not guilty by reason of mental illness. 
     
      
    153 I order that the accused be detained, pursuant to s.39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, in an appropriate correctional centre or such facility as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine until released by due process of law.  
     
      
    154 The Registrar is to notify the Minister of Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of the orders made by this Court. 
     
      
       
      Postscript 
       
      
    155 On application by the Crown Prosecutor, supported by senior counsel for the accused, the finding in paragraph [153] and the order made under s.39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 was set aside so as to permit an application on behalf of the accused to be made for the purpose of making further submissions on the question of the element of intention under s.18 of the Crimes Act 1900 in light of the finding made in the judgment that statements of the accused were unreliable and could not themselves support a finding on the issue of causation. 
     
      
    156 Leave was granted for further submissions to be made on that question: see: Regina v Doolan (No 2) [2010] NSWSC 194.

   JUDGMENT [Please note some sensitive matrial has been removed from this report of the remarks on sentence.]1. The Orana Local Area Command established a strike force to investigate ongoing supply of prohibited drugs in the Dubbo region. The investigation had had some success with a number of arrests, and several offenders brought before the court. 2. In September 2005, the District Court had sentenced Megan Finn to a three-year term of imprisonment for supplying prohibited drugs. In January 2009 she was supplying drugs again. If those in charge of policy settings are serious about reducing drug consumption in the community, it is time to question whether incarceration provides the most effective answer. Recidivism among drug users seems to be very high. It may be more thoughtful to attack the sickness as well as the crime.3. Today, Megan Finn is to be held accountable for her role in a drug syndicate supplying methylamphetamine in the Dubbo region. In three discrete supply transactions between 22 January 2009 and 14 February 2009, she supplied undercover police operatives a total of 83.7 grams of methylamphetamine for $10,500.4. On 5 March 2009, and again on 13 March 2009, she agreed to supply methylamphetamine totalling 56.8 grams. In fact no methylamphetamine was supplied, although an agreement to supply in law constitutes supplying. She asked that two further agreements to supply be taken into account on a Form 1 when I sentence her for the multiple actual supply offence. 5. As sentencing judge, it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions, as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence, before this Court, committed by this offender, with the capacity to harm numerous victims in the Dubbo community, Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1 SCR 688 [80]. 6. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offences before the court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to her, subjective matters. The starting point for such assessments requires a sentencing judge to make findings of fact from the evidence before the court, relating to the offence and to the offender. 7. Before any sentence can be made there are technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, parity, Form 1 matters, and finally of course the ultimate term of imprisonment or other penalty to be imposed. 8. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters, against an imperative that all sentencing will have as its primary focus the protection of the community, will also need to be determined. See R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.Facts9. On 22 January an undercover operative attended her home and negotiated the supply of an ounce of methylamphetamine for $3,500. Two days later the undercover operative returned to collect the drugs. That exercise was mirrored on 29 and 31 January, another ounce of methylamphetamine supplied for a further $3,500. A third transaction in the same terms was negotiated on 12 February 2009. Delivery of the drugs was effected at a local McDonalds two days later. Those three sales constitute the charge upon which she has been committed for sentence.10 On 5 March an undercover operative negotiated the supply of an ounce of methylamphetamine for $4,200. As on other occasions, he paid. During the following days she indicated on a number of occasions, attempts she was making to complete the supply. On the facts before me it is unclear what happened to the $4,200, but I am satisfied no supply occurred.11. On 13 March an undercover operative negotiated an identical deal. Whether the same or different operative, I know not. One would hope it was not the same. Again, the sum was paid, $4,200. Again the offender, on numerous occasions, indicated attempts she was making to complete the supply. The supply was not completed. Again it is unclear what happened to the $4,200 and whether that money was recovered.12. She was arrested on 13 March. After she was charged on 22 April 2009 she agreed to make a statement to police. It was on this occasion she agreed to assist police in their investigations into three other members of the syndicate.Objective Criminality13. From the facts as he finds them to be, the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offences as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of an offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant case with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of this offence is evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome.14. The courts and legislature have made it clear that drug supplying is an unacceptable criminal activity. It is not difficult to understand why drug supplying is a criminal activity. Contrary to what the offender may well have entertained initially, it is not social, but rather anti-social behaviour. The courts have long realised that in assessing the objective seriousness of a drug offence it is necessary to have regard to that drug’s potential for harm. Harm to others when inflicted by someone else, is anti-social. Drug dealing is harmful to the community by its direct impact upon those who purchase drugs, and its indirect impact upon the community at large.15. For some, if not most - and certainly in respect of amphetamines - drugs can be addictive. Some are also otherwise destructive of or contribute to mental health problems and/or aggression. Supplying drugs can lead to, create or sustain drug addicts. Drug addicts are human beings whose capacity to function and feel human is smothered to a greater or lesser extent by addiction and other effects of drugs. That is the real essence of the criminal harm done by suppliers of drugs, that is, that in a greater or a lesser way they are contributing to the disenabling of other human beings who buy drugs from those who deal. In that sense, then, drugs undermine public health.16. Associated with drug addiction are other forms of crime such as armed robbery, break, enter and steal. Robberies, that is, a loss of property to an owner by a drug addict, usually hanging out, results in loss of the owner’s property and his productive efforts in the community.17. Associated with robbery and break and enter offences is trauma, emotional and psychological damage to victims caused by violence or intrusion into their homes.18. Spending money on drugs, by addicts, without corresponding productivity by either group, that is, the sellers or the addicts, amounts to a monumental transference of wealth, usually from the already poor, without any corresponding economic gain to others in the community. At every level then, drug dealing is criminal conduct because of its corrosive effect upon the individuals and society as a whole.19. Section 25A was initially aimed principally at regular drug suppliers, who were in the business of supplying, but were not usually holding a substantial holding. It is the substantial holding that lifts the criminality of a drug supplier from the summary to the indictable jurisdiction, that is, from the Local Court to this court. It was thought that by creating an offence of consecutive dealing, that would target drug dealers who held small amounts of drugs, but were dealing regularly, and thereby put them into the higher jurisdiction.20. Supplying ounce lots of methylamphetamine would place the criminality of this offender for this charge above all of those small-time regular dealers. Each deal constituting a supply would have been sufficient in its own right to have been an indictable supply. Each supply was done reckless as to whether the purchaser would be on supplying to others. Each supply was done reckless as to who the end user would be. Fortunately, none of those drugs sold to the undercover operatives ended up in the community. Nonetheless, the potential for harm in supplying nearly eighty-four grams of amphetamine was significant.21. The recklessness in respect of the potential for harm in the fifty-six grams agreed to be supplied, is also significant. Finn was operating as a lower mid-level supplier for financial rewards. 22. I accept that she was herself a drug abuser, and skimmed off money for her own use and drug purchases, but her monetary intake relating to these streams of supply was in excess of $18,000. That intake from those sales alone, or agreed sales, was for a period from 22 January to 13 March. I am satisfied she was also supplying sources other than the undercover operatives for this period.23. Two things flow from that: Firstly, this was not an isolated incidence of supply, and secondly, it confirms and supports my finding she was supplying for financial gain. In arranging with her supplier to obtain the drugs, her text messages were heavily coded to avoid detection. In those circumstances, that is, given the network she was in, the sophistication of it, and the quantity of supply against a background of ongoing supplying to others, a substantial custodial sentence is called for.Subjective MattersFamily, Background, Relationships24. Ms Finn was aged thirty-four at the time of offending and is thirty-five now. When arrested, she and her de facto Andrew Hornby were living in her family home. Hornby is one of the persons earlier referred to as being arrested and before the court. This de facto relationship must have developed since her release from custody in November 2005. Previous to 2005 her de facto had been Peter Hamilton, who was arrested in 2004 for drug supply, and in April 2009 was still in custody. Her relationship with Hamilton had begun in 2003. It is possible he is related to Wayne Hamilton, also arrested for drug supply in 2009.25. In 2001 she had become engaged, as I understand it to a man other than Hamilton. It was also the year her father passed away. Although I have no psychological profile, it is claimed there are still unresolved grief issues relating to the father’s demise. She has two sisters and a brother. She is the youngest in her family. Her mother, Mrs Suckling, has written in support of her. In December 2009, Mrs Suckling was diagnosed with a subarachnoid haemorrhage secondary to an aneurism within the brain. An operation was needed, there was a coiling of the aneurism, after which she remained in intensive care for three weeks. Her prognosis was for a good recovery within the following two to three months.Education, Skills, Employment26. There is nothing before me as to Ms Finn’s schooling. It is likely she attended primary and secondary schooling in the Dubbo region where she grew up. She went through to year 12 level. More than that I know not. I do know that after school she did a six months secretarial course at TAFE, again, presumably in Dubbo. Her former employer wrote a reference for her. At the time of her arrest in 2009 she was working as a cleaner at Aussie Cabins and doing bank cleaning a couple of nights weekly. My understanding is Ms Finn believes there will be work for her in the Dubbo region when she leaves custody.General Health27. There is nothing before me suggesting Finn has any current physical health problems. Mental Health28. There is no evidence before the court giving any insight into any mental health issues. I have made reference to unresolved grief issues over the father’s death. Her mother writes of “characters of questionable nature that played upon her psychological problems”. She is a drug abuser. These three pieces of evidence are suggestive that there may be mental health issues playing some part in her criminal conduct, or of importance in her rehabilitation path. However, there is a burden of proof on the defence in respect of mitigation matters. That has not been met or, I suspect, attempted in respect of mental health forces confronting the offender at the time of her offending.Drugs and Alcohol29. She claims to have commenced using drugs in her relationship with Peter Hamilton in 2003. In the course of this relationship she distanced herself from her family. It is likely her drug of choice was amphetamine. Her level of drug abuse is unclear. She was released from prison in November 2005. Two months later, in January 2006, she was in contact with Wayne Hamilton. In 2006 - I should hasten to say later in 2006, but while still on parole, she was talking to him about dealings Hornby, her then partner, was having in relation to supplying drugs. Her purpose in the discussion was to assist Hornby in starting to supply amphetamines. An arrangement was made for Hornby to supply amphetamines. That arrangement ultimately fizzled. In May or June 2007 she contacted Hamilton again, trying to make some easy money.30. Hornby and she had a little money on them, so she arranged to go to Sydney to meet with Wayne. They met at Glossodia but with the spare money they both had she bought amphetamine from Wayne. She cannot recall this time how much amphetamine she bought and both she and her partner used that amphetamine for on- supplying in Dubbo. 31. In her last term of imprisonment there was a failed supply urine sample three months prior to her release. Thus far in her present custodial history there are no further disciplinary charges and in particular no further drug charges. The inference is open that on her last custodial sentence she was using, in prison, at least during that last period in custody. Character and Criminal History32. To her mother, Ms Finn is a caring and quiet person. Her mother did not think her daughter “meant to be corrupt in any way”. It was just that “she met up with characters of a questionable nature”. I have already made findings of her recklessness as to the harm her dealing was likely to cause in the community. Her former employer found her undoubtedly honest, caring, family oriented, level headed, well liked by other employees, having a happy go lucky disposition and the former employer offered that her offending conduct was out of character. 33. Frankly her dealing with the Parole Board or Probation and Parole, whoever it was, was not honest. She was championing her partner’s cause of supplying whilst still on parole. I have found she was reckless as to the harm her drug supplying activities could cause others. I do not find her caring in those circumstances. It is her second occasion before the courts for drug dealing and her activities since 2003 would suggest the offence was not out of character. 34. Her appearances in the criminal courts began in February of 1998 with a charge of common assault, goods in custody, apprehended domestic violence offence. In 1999 she was before the courts in respect of three domestic violence matters. Her next conviction was in 2005 for the supply prohibited drug for which as I earlier noted, she did three years sentence. Her involvement on this occasion constituted assisting in the weighing and packaging of drugs, taking orders for supplying drugs, hiring vehicles to facilitate the movement of drugs and being the cashier and banker by receiving proceeds from sales on behalf of her then partner and banking the same. Twenty six thousand dollars was deposited into her account over a four month period on that last occasion. 35. At the time of her arrest in 2004, I think it was, she assisted investigating police by revealing the location of 183 grams of methylamphetamine with thirty per cent purity. At that level of purity the methylamphetamine would have been cut down before reaching street level purchasers. Her prior record is such as to disentitle her to leniency.Rehabilitation Prospects36. Megan Finn’s rehabilitation prospects must be assessed with some caution. The case put before Judge Hock in 2005 has a number of similarities to the case advanced before me. Influence of her then de facto, who was a drug dealer, ... her claimed contrition or absence of it, her early plea, her unresolved grief over her father’s death, her evidence and her mother’s evidence that her community support, including evidence from her former employer were all said to go in her favour. The only reason community support goes in favour on sentence is because it is seen as a positive rehabilitation fact. 37. Given that the past community support has not proved to be a positive rehabilitation factor, it is difficult for me to see why I should take it favourably into account on this occasion. Her Honour said in 2005 (R v Finn unreported 30-09-05 Hock DCJ): 
     
      
      “ I also accept the offender’s evidence that unresolved grief over her father’s death in 2001 was a precipitating factor in her turning to prohibited drugs. Her evidence coupled with that of her mother leads me to conclude that she now has considerable insight into her problems. She has made excellent use of her time in custody to date and she will have family support on her release. Importantly, she also has some other community support, in particular, her employer for five years prior to her remand in custody is prepared to offer her casual work on her release. In my view she has very good prospects for rehabilitation. 
       
       
      I have taken into account the plea of guilty which the Crown concedes was entered at the first reasonable opportunity. I have reduced the sentence by 25% for the utilitarian value of the plea to the criminal justice system and as displaying a willingness to facilitate the course of justice. 
       
       
      I have also taken into account the offender’s remorse which I accept is genuine and the delay in the matter being finalised for which it seems she was not responsible. I find special circumstances, namely that this is the offender’s first time in custody and that she will benefit from an extended period of supervision.” 
       
       
      
    38. Yet as I noted, within three months of her release she was in contact with Wayne Hamilton, and within her parole period, discussing supplying drugs on behalf of her partner. Her role in the offence before me went well beyond her involvement in drugs with Peter Hamilton. Her support base has not changed and proved ineffective on the occasion of her last release. Indeed, Hornby lived in the mother’s home. It was the mother’s home which was the scene where the undercover police conducted their negotiations and received the drugs. 39. There is a difference between seeking to minimise the consequences of being charged by early pleas ... and genuine contrition and insight doing exactly the same things. I am satisfied on the occasion of 2005 charging, the offender simply did the best she could for herself. This offender relies on having started a drug and alcohol programme, it is a twelve week programme. Frankly I am cautious in assessing her rehabilitation as being positive.Plea40. She has pleaded before the Local Court. She claims contrition. The Crown does not challenge the claim. While I certainly have reservations in the absence of the challenge by the Crown, the offender is entitled to have a finding made in her favour. I intend to allow a twenty five per cent discount for the plea and contrition. 41. .... 42. .... Setting the Sentence- Deterrence43. In this case there is a need for both general and personal deterrence. The maximum penalty for the offence that I am dealing with is twenty years’ imprisonment. Applying the Discount44. But for the plea of guilty ... I would have set an overall sentence of five and a half years’ imprisonment. I have indicated that that term should be reduced by forty five per cent .... That results in a reduction of two and a half years to the sentence I would otherwise have set, leaving an overall sentence of three years imprisonment. I have decided to find special circumstances. My primary reason for so doing is to mitigate the consequences in her incarceration arising from her giving assistance to the authorities. There was some evidence before me as to some of those consequences. How long they will last for is not in evidence before me, but I am prepared to accept that they may last for some time into her sentence.Formal Orders45. Megan Frances Finn you are convicted that between 22 January and 14 February 2009 at Dubbo you did on three or more separate occasions, during the period of thirty consecutive days, supply a prohibited drug other than cannabis, namely methylamphetamine, for financial reward. Taking into account the two further agreements to supply that I have made reference to in my remarks and that are on the Form 1, I sentence you to a non-parole period of twenty one months, to date from 14 March 2009 and to expire on 13 December this year, 2010. I set a balance of term of fifteen months, to expire on 13 March 2012. I order you to be released to parole on 13 December 2010 in respect of this offence. I order the drugs to be destroyed. 46. .... Ms Finn you may be returned to custody and I wish you luck.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused Arnold Coleman, was arraigned on indictment on 13 March 2009. He was charged with the murder of Jean Kathleen Coleman on 2 October 2008 at Goonellabah, New South Wales.  
     
      
    2 A fitness to be tried hearing was held on 27 May 2009 in which Adams J made a finding under s.14 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (“the Act”) that the accused was unfit to be tried. Adams J referred the matter to the Mental Health Review Tribunal pursuant to s.14(a) of the Act. 
     
      
    3 The Mental Health Review Tribunal determined pursuant to s.16(1) and s.45(4) and (5) of the Act that on the balance of probabilities the accused would not during the next 12 months become fit to be tried. 
     
      
    4 Bail was refused and the accused was remanded as a forensic patient at Long Bay Prison Hospital pursuant to the Mental Health Review Tribunal’s determination under s.46(1) of the Act. The Tribunal unanimously confirmed these findings on 1 February 2010.  
     
      
    5 On 21 October 2009, the Director of Public Prosecutions, pursuant to s.19 of the Act, elected to proceed with the charge of murder against the accused. 6 On 24 February 2010, a special hearing pursuant to s.19 of the Act was held before this Court in Lismore, New South Wales. Mr C Bruce SC appeared for the accused. The Crown tendered two bundles of documents, Exhibit A and Exhibit B, which represented the material that both parties relied upon in the proceedings. Counsel for the accused did not contest any factual matters or Crown contentions. 
     
      
    7 The accused relied upon the defence of mental illness. This defence was based upon the evidence that at the time he killed Jean Coleman the accused was suffering from a psychotic disorder with delusions. The delusions centred on the victim, the accused’s wife, having an affair with various neighbours. It has also been suggested that the accused was suffering from vascular dementia at the time of the offence.  
     
      
       
      The events occurring on the 2 October 2008 
       
      
    8 The events were the subject of the special hearing took place on 2 October 2008 at Goonellabah. The following account of what took place is largely based upon the admissions of the accused.  
     
      
    9 The deceased, Jean Coleman, was the accused’s wife. The accused resided with her in their home at 14 Hillcrest Avenue, Goonellabah. On the morning of 22 October 2008, Athena Kontjonis, a community nurse, and Mrs Nobbs, the deceased’s daughter, visited the accused and his wife. They departed shortly after 9.00 am. At approximately 10.45 am, the accused waited for the deceased to go to sleep. He then went and got a vegetable knife from the kitchen drawer and went back into the bedroom. After he got the knife the accused stated his intention was to kill his wife. 
     
      
    10 After watching the deceased sleep for several minutes the accused threw his body across the deceased, pinning her down to prevent her from escaping. A struggle ensued which lasted for approximately 20 minutes. The accused stabbed the deceased in the throat and then multiple times in the upper chest. He stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “She started to scream so I wanted to shut her up. I then just kept stabbing to make sure she would die . . . I made sure she was dead before I called 000.” 
         (Statement of Constable Puttock, Exhibit A, p.27)  
        
       
      
    11 At 11.11 am, the accused called police via the emergency 000 line. He told the operator that he had just killed his wife. 
     
      
    12 The accused was fixed with the delusion that his wife was having an affair. The accused repeatedly stated that he stabbed his wife “because she was playin’ up for the bloke next door”.13 The accused has made multiple and consistent admissions to police and to medical staff since the incident.  
     
      
       
      Issues 
       
      
    14 The Crown is obliged to prove beyond reasonable doubt the elements of murder which are relevantly as follows:-  
     
      
       
      (1) That Jean Coleman died. 
       
       
      (2) That her death was caused by the actions of the accused, Arnold Coleman, by stabbing her in the neck. 
       
       
      (3) That at the time of committing those actions, Arnold Coleman intended either to kill Jean Coleman or at least to cause grievous bodily harm. 
       
      
    15 Whilst the accused had the benefit of the presumption of innocence the way the case proceeded, there was no issue concerning proof of the elements of the offence. In relation to the issue of the accused’s mental state at the time of the offence, Mr Bruce, on behalf of the accused, contended that, at the time of doing the act causing death, he was mentally ill so as not to be responsible in law for his acts.  
     
      
    16 In the circumstances to which I have referred and on the evidence in Exhibit A, there is no difficulty in concluding beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, by his deliberate acts, caused the death of the deceased and possessed the requisite intent to do so.  
     
      
    17 The only issue in this trial is whether the accused has available to him the defence of mental illness.  
     
      
    18 The fundamental role of the law is to hold people responsible for their actions. It is recognised, however, that a person may not be so responsible by reason of mental illness.  
     
      
    19 The onus of proof of the defence of mental illness rests upon the accused to prove the defence on the balance of probabilities: Mizzi v Regina (1960) 105 CLR 659.  
     
      
    20 Section 38(1) of the Act provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “If, in an indictment or information, an act or omission is charged against a person as an offence and it is given in evidence on the trial of the person for the offence that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done or omission made, then, if it appears to the jury before which the person is tried that the person did the act or made the omission charged, but was mentally ill at the time when the person did or made the same, the jury must return a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness.” 
        
       
      
    21 The Act does not define the term mentally ill. The term must be determined in accordance with the M’Naghton Rules laid down in Regina v M’Naghton (1843) 8 ER 718. 
     
      
       
      The test for mental illness 
       
      
    22 The statement of the test for the defence of mental illness was propounded in the case of M’Naghton (supra). The accused must establish that, at the time the acts were committed, he was suffering from a defect of reason, from a disease of the mind, so as not to know the quality and nature of the act he was doing or, alternatively, if he did know it, that he did not know that what he was doing was wrong.  
     
      
    23 It is important that I identify the principles that govern the test to be applied in this case and to which I will be referring later in this judgment when I come to consider the medical evidence.  
     
      
    24 In relation to the applicable principles, the High Court has stated that if through disordered condition of the mind the accused could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure or did not know it was wrong according to the every day standards of reasonable people, it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong: Regina v Porter (1933) 55 CLR 182 at 189-90.  
     
      
    25 The law requires that the accused’s state of mind must have been one of disease, disorder or disturbance arising from some condition which may be temporary or of long standing, whether curable or incurable: Regina v Kemp [1957] 1 QB 399. The distinction to be drawn is between a defect of reason from an underlying mental illness as distinct from the reaction of a healthy mind to some extraordinary external factor which is transient, that is, passing and not prone to recur: Regina v Quick (1973) QB 910, cf Radford v The Queen (1985) 42 SASR at 274–275. 
     
      
    26 To establish that the accused was mentally ill so as not to be responsible according to law for the act of killing Jean Coleman the defence must show that, as a result of a defect of reason from a disease of the mind, he did not appreciate the nature and quality of those physical acts or that he did not know that those acts were wrong.  
     
      
    27 The determination of the issue of whether the accused was mentally ill at the time of the offence turns on the evidence of three experienced forensic psychiatrists.  
     
      
       
      The accused’s medical history from 2005 to 2 October 2008 
       
      
    28 Prior to 2005, the accused had no recorded history of mental illness. Although he was noted to have always been very possessive of the deceased, his possessiveness did not appear to have been detrimental until 2005.  
     
      
    29 On 17 October 2005, the accused was admitted to St Vincent’s Private Hospital with suicidal ideation. The accused’s niece, Lynne Marsters, indicated that the accused had “come to stay with her, having delusions about wife having an affair”. 
     
      
    30 In 2005, the accused was referred and treated by Community Mental Health Services for delusional symptoms. Dr Petroff assessed the accused on 19 October 2005 and noted that the accused “does have homicidal thoughts and may act on these if he could prove Jean is seeing another man”. 
     
      
    31 The deceased told her daughter, Helen Nobbs, that in 2005 the accused had tried to strangle her while she was in bed. This incident was acknowledged by the accused when interviewed by police on 2 October 2008. He stated, “I tried to strangle her by falling on top of her and choking her down, then I woke up to meself and she pulled me back out of it”. 
     
      
    32 During 2005, the accused was treated with medication by Dr Pettroff for a morbid jealousy syndrome and later reported the disappearance of the delusional symptoms. However, Dr Ward, psychiatrist, noted in 2008 that the period between the accused’s symptoms subsiding in 2005 due to medication and relapse when he stopped taking the medication does not appear to have been lengthy.33 On 17 March 2008, the deceased and Lynne Marsters reported to Meredith Ward from Richmond Aged Care that the accused had “paranoid ideas that (the) wife was having affairs, setting traps for her - this has been occurring on and off since 2005”. It was also noted that the deceased found these allegations very distressing.  
     
      
    34 Upon referral from Meredith Ward for “increasing themes of morbid jealously re wife”, the accused saw Dr Ward on 15 April 2008. Dr Ward noted similar themes present in the accused’s current delusions as when the accused was treated in 2005.  
     
      
    35 The accused reported that he had been suffering from his current delusional symptoms for the previous 18 months to two years. Dr Ward noted that the accused’s reasoning regarding his wife was increasingly bizarre.  
     
      
       
      The accused’s mental history from 2 October 2008 to the present  
       
      
    36 Athena Kontjonis, a community nurse, saw the accused at home on the morning of 2 October 2008. She noted that the accused seemed happy although a little confused. 
     
      
    37 Following the incident, police admitted the accused to Lismore Base Hospital where Dr Peter Siepkon examined the accused. Dr Siepkon determined that the accused was suffering from a mental illness with a disorder of thought. He was found to be mentally ill with “fixed psychosis” and mild to moderate dementia. 
     
      
    38 Staff at Lismore Base Hospital noted the accused’s delusional beliefs regarding his wife. The accused stated to staff that his wife was playing around, that she had done it three times in the past and that proof of this was because “she went out to the garbage at least three times a day”. The accused also claimed that his wife was never there when he wanted her and that she would sleep all day and be up all night which he claimed was further proof of her infidelities.  
     
      
    39 John Lyons, a registered nurse at Lismore Base Hospital, noted that the accused was not suffering from hallucinations but he noted evidence of some distorted/delusional thinking regarding the accused’s wife’s behaviour. He concluded, “The overall impression is of an 87 year-old male who does not understand the seriousness of his actions”. 
     
      
    40 A CT brain scan report dated 3 October 2008 of the accused noted no abnormalities other than “several tiny chronic lacunar infarcts in the external capsulae and in the right corona-radiata with poorly defined hypoattenuating areas in the periventricular white bilaterally consistent with age related change and/or chronic small vessel ischaemia”. 
     
      
    41 On 8 October 2008, staff at Grafton Correctional Centre noted the accused’s continuing delusional beliefs regarding his wife. The accused stated that he had killed his wife and that she was having affairs with neighbours and Jimmy Little. 
     
      
    42 The Mental Health Tribunal report of 14 January 2010, compiled by Ms Emily Tartecova, Dr Elizabeth Page and Dr Leila Cavanaugh, was of the opinion that the accused is certainly suffering from dementia and appeared to be suffering from psychosis. However, the Tribunal noted that the relationship between the psychosis and the dementia remains unclear. 
     
      
    43 The NSW Community Forensic Mental Health Service produced an Initial Risk Management Report regarding the accused it was prepared on 15 December 2009 by Ms Tartakover, Dr Page and Dr Kavanagh. The report expresses an opinion that the accused is suffering from a Psychotic Disorder, most likely to be a delusional Disorder Jealous Type, of long standing. The report concludes that the accused’s dementia is a separate entity unrelated to his psychosis and is not as significant as previously thought. The report states that in the past the accused had historically been able to contain his delusional ideas, however environmental stressors, such as Urinary Tract Infections, or surgical interventions may have caused him to verbalise and then act on his delusional system. 
     
      
      Expert medical evidence  
       
      
    44 Three experienced forensic psychiatrists produced reports which were tendered as evidence. Dr Sinclair prepared a report at the request of the Local Lismore Court. The Crown submitted a report by Dr Delaforce and the report by Dr Westmore was submitted on behalf of the accused. There is a strong consistency between the three psychiatric opinions in relation to this matter.  
     
      
       
      (1) Dr Barbara Sinclair 
       
      
    45 Dr Barbara Sinclair, psychiatrist, prepared a report at the request of the Lismore Court on 1 December 2008.  
     
      
    46 The accused and the deceased had been married for 17 years. The accused was impotent for the entirety of his marriage to the deceased due to peripheral vascular disease and after the amputation of the accused’s leg, this jealousy and possessiveness was noted to have worsened.  
     
      
    47 The accused repeatedly reported to Dr Sinclair that he had killed his wife because of his belief that she was having an affair. He stated, “All I wanted was to stab her; I wanted to finish her off; she was not interested in me; she was on with the bloke next door”. 
     
      
    48 When the accused was asked why he thought his wife was having an affair he stated, “No idea”. Dr Sinclair noted that the accused had not seen anything, heard anything or was told anything by anybody that would suggest that his wife was having an affair. The accused stated, “I just know it”. 
     
      
    49 Dr Sinclair conducted a psychiatric assessment of the accused on 3 November 2008. She was of the view that the accused was suffering from vascular dementia with psychotic features and that he had developed an entrenched and delusional belief about his wife’s infidelity at the time of the offence. Dr Sinclair regarded the aetiology of the delusional belief system as originating in his peripheral vascular disease leading on to dementia. Dr Sinclair expressed a view that she thought the accused was mentally ill and noted that he still had ongoing delusional beliefs about his wife’s infidelity. She also noted that the accused appeared to be experiencing hallucinations, specifically that since his wife’s death he had heard her talk to him.  
     
      
       
      (2) Dr Robert Delaforce 
       
      
    50 Dr Robert Delaforce saw the accused on 13 February 2009. He reviewed the evidence in the Crown case including the accused’s prior medical records, medical reports and the record of interview conducted by police with the accused. Dr Delaforce also had access to Dr Westmore’s first report dated 30 January 2009. 51 Dr Delaforce noted that the accused had a history of entrenched delusional beliefs regarding the infidelity of his wife. These delusions were first noted in 2005 by the Aged Care and Assessment Team. 52 Dr Delaforce noted the accused was always very possessive of the deceased. He stated that the accused would “be more prone with increasing age and therefore increasing likelihood of cognitive decline to have problems with jealousy”.53 Dr Delaforce considered that the records examined by him including medical records and statements from family members revealed a marked change in the accused’s behaviour from 2005.  
     
      
    54 He concluded that by 2005 at the very latest the accused’s jealousy had reached a serious stage. Probably in 2005 at the latest this represented a delusion of jealous type.55 As to a diagnosis of Vascular Dementia, Dr Delaforce stated that although the accused was first diagnosed in 2005 he did not consider his cognitive difficulties were of substance until 2008. He noted there is “a substantial risk in assessing Mr Coleman’s cognitive functioning in his visual and hearing difficulties because unless they are noted at the time their effects can be misinterpreted as cognitive dysfunction”. He concluded the accused had suffered from Dementia of Alzheimer’s Type and/or Vascular Dementia with Delusions probably since 2008. He attributed the prior delusions suffered by the accused from 2005 to a “psychotic disorder, with delusions due to the vascular and other changes”. 
     
      
    56 Dr Delaforce noted extensive and consistent corroboration of the accused’s reported delusional beliefs that his wife was having affairs. He noted that the accused had no basis on which to form these beliefs:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Instead he had inappropriate ideas beyond just jealous thoughts, such as because his wife met the man at the garbage bin that meant to him that his wife must have been unfaithful”.  
        
       
      
    57 Dr Delaforce went on to state that these beliefs were not just jealous beliefs. They were delusional thinking. Dr Delaforce also noted that the accused’s emotionally cold behaviour regarding the incident is also consistent with a delusional belief system.  
     
      
    58 Dr Delaforce concluded his report by stating (at p.22):- 
     
      
       
        
        “I would support here the use of the defence of mental illness against the charge of murder. Mr Coleman because of his defect of reason from a disease of the mind, his Dementia with Delusions, could not appropriately and sufficiently calmly reason to allow him to appreciate the wrongness of his act he reported as stabbing his wife with intent to kill. The defect of reason included instead his unsupported belief of his wife’s infidelity.”  
        
       
       
      (3) Dr Bruce Westmore 
       
      
    59 Dr Bruce Westmore examined the accused on 27 January 2009. He had reviewed the reports of Dr Delaforce and Dr Sinclair.  
     
      
    60 He concluded in an addendum report dated 4 February 2010, specifically addressing the issue of the defence of mental illness, that:-  
     
      
       
        
        “Based on the additional history and my diagnosis that Mr Coleman suffers from dementia, then he would have available to him a defence of mental illness. He suffers from a disease of the mind, which would totally deprive him of the capacity to know that he ought not to do the act.” 
        
       
       
      Conclusions  
       
      
    61 As to the elements of murder, I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt, that on 2 October 2008 at Goonellabah in the State of New South Wales:- 
     
      
       
      (1) That Jean Coleman died. 
       
       
      (2) That her death was caused by the actions of the accused, Arnold Coleman, by stabbing her in the neck. 
       
       
      (3) That at the time of committing those actions, Arnold Coleman intended to kill Jean Coleman. 
      
    62 Accordingly, on the basis of those findings and pursuant to the provisions of s.21A of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, I determine that the accused, Arnold Coleman, committed the offence charged in the indictment referred to in paragraph [1] of this judgment. 
     
      
    63 Regarding the availability of the defence of metal illness to the accused, it is clear on the evidence that the accused has always been very jealous and possessive of the deceased. This possessiveness significantly worsened since 2005.  
     
      
    64 It is equally clear that over several years since at least 2005, the accused has suffered from Delusional Disorder, Jealous Type and that, from probably 2008 onwards, the accused was also suffering from dementia. 
     
      
    65 It is evident both from the medical reports and statements of family members that the accused possessed a delusional belief that Jean Coleman was having an affair. That delusional belief and its various manifestations has clearly been present at least since 2005 and is regarded as having been entrenched by at least 2008 and it continues to be the accused’s belief system to date. This delusional belief was certainly the accused’s motivating factor in killing his wife.  
     
      
    66 On the evidence it is clear that the accused, at the time that he stabbed his wife, Mrs Jean Coleman, suffered from an abnormality of mind specifically dementia with Delusional Disorder, Jealous Type. This abnormality of mind significantly impaired the accused’s perception of events and his ability to know right from wrong.  
     
      
    67 There is a strong consistency between the psychiatric opinions in relation to this matter. Dr Westmore and Dr Delaforce are essentially in agreement that he has available to him the defence of mental illness in that the accused had a defect of reason arising from a disease of the mind. Although there appears to be some divergence at what point in time the accused began to suffer from dementia, it is however unnecessary to intensely scrutinise this divergence. It is sufficient to say that either vascular dementia in and/or a Delusional Disorder would provide and does provide an adequate basis for the defence of mental illness. 
     
      
      Practical and legal consequences of a finding of not guilty by reason of mental illness 
       
      
    68 Section 39 of the Act provides:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) If, on the trial of a person charged with an offence, the jury returns a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness, the Court may order that the person be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law or may make such other order (including an order releasing the person from custody, either unconditionally or subject to conditions) as the Court considers appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The Court is not to make an order under this section for the release of a person from custody unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person’s release. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) As soon as practicable after the making of an order under this section, the Registrar of the Court is to notify the Minister for Health and the Tribunal of the terms of the order.” 
        
       
      
    69 The legal and practical consequences of a finding that the accused is “not guilty on the ground of mental illness” may be shortly stated.  
     
      
    70 The statute which governs cases like this, namely, s.39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, requires me to consider making an order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law. In practice, this means not only that the accused remains in custody until a decision is made to release him, but also that he becomes what is known as a forensic patient and falls under the supervision of a body called the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  
     
      
    71 The Mental Health Review Tribunal consists of a president and his/her deputy, who must be a lawyer. It also consists of two other persons, one of whom must be a psychiatrist. The third member is a person who has suitable qualifications or experience for the task.  
     
      
    72 The Tribunal is required to review the accused’s case as soon as practicable after an order is made for his detention in strict custody. The Tribunal may make orders as to his continued detention, care or treatment, or as to this release. 
     
      
    73 The Tribunal cannot make an order for the release of the accused unless it is satisfied that the safety of that person or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release. The Minister for Health and the Attorney General may appear before the Tribunal, or make submissions to the Tribunal, in relation to the possible release of the accused.  
     
      
    74 Where an order for release is not made, the Tribunal orders result in continued detention, care and treatment in a place and manner specified by the Tribunal. 
     
      
    75 After the initial review, the Tribunal must, at least once every six months, again review the case and make orders as to the accused’s continued detention, care or treatment in a hospital, prison or other place or as to his release.  
     
      
    76 If release is ordered, then it may be on conditions or it may be unconditional. If any condition is breached, or where the mental condition of the accused has deteriorated so that he may be a serious danger to others, a further order may be made by the Tribunal for his apprehension, care and detention.  
     
      
    77 The conditions which could be prescribed include matters such as living in a particular place, taking particular medication, appointments with health care professionals, enrolment in educational and therapeutic programmes, to ensure that the accused is properly cared for. Other than pursuant to any such release, the accused would remain, as I have said previously, in strict custody within one of the psychiatric institutions caring for forensic patients. 
     
      
    78 Security conditions (as necessary) are in place while the accused is detained in a hospital, prison or other place or if he is allowed to be temporarily absent from the place of detention.  
     
      
    79 The accused may be released from these restrictions if given an unconditional release, or where released on conditions and those conditions have expired over time. However, as I have previously explained, the accused will only ever be released when the Mental Health Review Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that his safety and the safety of any member of the public will not thereby be seriously endangered.  
     
      
       
      Risk Management Report 
       
      
    80 The NSW Community Forensic Mental Health Service have produced an Initial Risk Management Report regarding the accused which was prepared on 15 December 2009 by Ms Tartakover, Dr Page and Dr Kavanagh.  
     
      
    81 The report noted that the accused’s psychotic symptoms remain active and that the accused remains a risk not only to himself but also to others.  
     
      
    82 The accused currently suffers from a range of general medical conditions and is currently suicidal although the report noted that there may not be sufficient evidence to satisfy a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder. 
     
      
    83 It appears that in the past the accused has historically been able to contain his delusional ideas, however environmental stressors, such as Urinary Tract Infections, or surgical interventions may have caused him to verbalise and then act on his delusional system. The report concluded that in the event that the accused contracts another infection, there is a risk of him acting violently towards someone (more likely a female, given his history) with whom he perceives he has some kind of relationship.  
     
      
    84 Treating the accused’s psychotic illness with low dose antipsychotic medication and any infections together with close monitoring of his mental state might protect against this risk.  
     
      
    85 The report expressed the opinion that the accused suffers from a mental illness, as defined by the Mental Health Act 2007, in that he has a condition that seriously impairs, either temporarily or permanently, his mental functioning and is characterised by delusions and relevantly for the question of disposition:-  
     
      
       
        
        “It is our opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that care, treatment and control of Mr Coleman is necessary for his own protection from serious harm and the protection of others from serious harm. If left inadequately treated, Mr Coleman’s condition is likely to deteriorate and he will thus remain a risk to himself and others” 
         (Initial Risk Management Report, Exhibit B, p.17). 
        
       
      
    86 Upon the basis of that report the Crown submitted, and Defence counsel did not submit otherwise, that the Court could not be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the release of the accused, either subject to conditions or not, was the appropriate order. The Crown further submitted that the accused should remain detained in the Long Bay Hospital. 
     
      
    87 Pursuant to s.43(a) of the Act, the Initial Risk Management Report anticipated that if there is some improvement in his mental state in the future, on the balance of probabilities, the safety of the accused and the public is unlikely to be seriously endangered by his release to a locked ward at Macquarie Hospital. I consider, on the evidence, an order should be made for Mr Coleman’s detention under s.39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. 
     
      
      Orders  
       
      
    88 I am satisfied and I find that at the time of doing the acts causing death the accused was mentally ill so as not to be responsible in law for his acts and, accordingly, I am required to return a special verdict.  
     
      
    89 Arnold Coleman, upon the charge that on 2 October 2008 at Goonellabah in the State of New South Wales you did murder Jean Kathleen Coleman, pursuant to the provisions of s.22(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I find that you are not guilty by reason of mental illness.  
     
      
    90 I order that the accused be detained, pursuant to s.39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, in an appropriate correctional centre or such facility as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine until released by due process of law.  
     
      
    91 The Registrar is to notify the Minister of Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of the orders made by this Court.  
     
      
    92 Finally, I would like to take the opportunity of extending my deepest sympathy to Mrs Colman’s family, who would undoubtedly be deeply affected by this tragic event.

    JUDGMENT1. On 27 January 2010 Michael Fortescue was arraigned upon an indictment alleging he supplied ecstasy on 15 February 2009. To this charge he has pleaded not guilty. 2. The Crown case is in the early hours of the morning two police officers who were conducting observations of the Nightclub in Bridge Street, Sydney, had cause to search the accused’s person. Concealed in his underwear they found a small orange-coloured Eclipse brand mint container containing fifty-three ecstasy tablets. 3. The defence claim police had no right to stop, search or detain the accused and behaved unlawfully in doing these things. The defence argued that the evidence obtained as a result of the search and detention was therefore unlawfully obtained and should not be admitted because the desirability of admitting the evidence is outweighed by the undesirability of admitting it [see s.138 Evidence Act 1995].4. The court’s task is to determine whether, in the circumstances of their encounter, the police reasonably suspected the accused of having anything on his person that was unlawfully obtained or used or intended to be used in the commission of an indictable offence, at the point in time where they stopped, searched and detained the accused. If police had no reasonable grounds for stopping, searching and detaining the accused, then the second matter to be determined is whether the s 138 discretion should be exercised to admit the evidence (s 138 Evidence Act 1995). 5. The two police involved in the search and detention gave evidence. The accused, as was his right, did not give evidence, although evidence was before the court of a post-arrest urine test. The statement of facts submitted by police to the Local Court magistrate was also tendered. I will return to these items later.Who Bears the Burden6. At all times in a criminal trial the accused is under no obligation to give or call evidence in his case. That does not mean that all other rules of evidence are suspended. The onus is on an accused to prove the police behaved in contravention of an Australian law. Should that proposition be established on the balance of probabilities, the onus then falls upon the Crown to establish the desirability of admitting any tainted evidence outweighs the undesirability of excluding it.7. The law in question is said to be the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002, LEPRA s 21(1)(a) which appears in Pt 4 of the LEPRA - Search and Seizure Powers Without Warrant. Section 21(1)(d) gives to the police a power without warrant to stop, search and detain a person if the police officer suspects on reasonable grounds that the person has in his possession a prohibited drug, in contravention of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. Absent that power, a police officer would be acting in contravention of the Common Law to stop, search and detail a person. A police officer purporting to exercise that power, given by LEPRA, to stop, search and detain, would be acting in contravention of the law if he or she did not have reasonable grounds for suspecting his or her target had been in possession of prohibited drugs. 8. Thus the burden of proving a breach of common law or a misuse of LEPRA rests with the accused in this trial. A crucial issue in the trial is the point at which the police officers purported to exercise the power to “stop” the accused and whether at that time they had reasonable grounds to do so. The stopping of a person for purposes of a search is the first step police take in order to conduct a search in circumstances such as this case.9. A chat, simply for social purposes or during which observations are being made or even as a trick to further investigation does not constitute a stopping “if the accused is free to quit the conversation/observation/investigation and depart at any time”. 10. In R v Rondo [2001] NSWCCA 540 a vehicle was stopped for no greater reason than police became aware the person driving the vehicle was not the registered owner of the vehicle. Thousands upon thousands of Sydneysiders are lawfully driving vehicles in circumstances where they are not the registered owner. Workers driving company cars, persons in relationships driving their partner’s cars, taxi drivers sharing shifts with registered owners are three groups that readily spring to mind. The Court of Criminal Appeal held in Rondo such a stopping was unlawful because there were no reasonable grounds in the answer given by the driver (that he was not the owner) and that answer alone to suspect any wrong doing.11. In the case before me, two police officers had been alerted to the presence of the accused and his companion in a laneway more dimly lit than surrounding areas. The two men were in the vicinity and police believed had been in attendance at the Tank Nightclub which had a reputation among police as a well known establishment for drug users. At some point the police stopped the accused and his companion and whilst they were so stopped searched them. The point in time at which the accused and his companion were stopped, that is the point at which they were required to comply with the demand they remain and were no longer free to leave for the moment, although not yet arrested.12. That point in time is important. Many of us have experienced being stopped and detained by police. A good example is a roadside breath test. The onus was on the defence to prove that at that particular point in time police had no reasonable grounds to suspect possession of drugs on either person. Neither counsels' questions or submissions focused on that point in time. It remains for me to determine on the evidence. 13. It was the Crown case in the early hours of 15 February 2009 that two plain clothes police, Constable Luke Pisani and then Probationary Constable Nathan Coates were on duty in the Tank Stream Way and Bridge Lane, Sydney area. The Tank Nightclub is located nearby. 14. They saw the accused and his male companion walking down Bridge Street lane into Tank Stream Way. Each describes the accused as looking over his shoulder at least three times as they walk. Both sat down on a bench. At this point in time the distance between police and the two men was about ten metres. Each man lit a cigarette. 15. Pisani’s evidence is that he said to Coates “We will go over and talk to them.” They went across, showed their police ID and said, “Good day boys, how’s it going?” Pisani showed his police badge and introduced himself and Probationary Constable Coates. Ms Bateman put in issue the showing of the police badge by Constable Pisani. In cross-examination it was agreed that there was or may have been in this time conversation about Good Vibrations (a band) and Chinese Laundry (a nightclub) by way of social chit chat. In a record of interview which was conducted at 4.19am (Q & A 19 to 22). I am satisfied both police showed their badge upon approaching, notwithstanding the evidence of Constable Coates to the contrary.16. Pisani agrees at some stage he introduced himself and asked, “Have you taken drugs this evening?” And “Do you think where you are sitting is suspicious?” 17. During the course of the conversation police made observation of the accused having dilated pupils and white paste material in the corner of his mouth. Both symptoms were significant to the officer, because each was consistent with drug use. Ms Bateman, for the defence, put in issue the presence of a white paste material in the corner of the mouth. She relied upon visual images of the accused during a record of interview conducted at Surry Hills Police Station at 4.19am and thereafter as establishing an absence of white paste in the corner of the mouth at that time. I am satisfied at 4.19am the accused presented at the interview room without white paste on the corners of his mouth.18. Police claim in evidence the accused had two mobile phones next to him on the bench. The presence of these mobile phones on the bench also has been put in issue by the defence. That claim first appears to have been made by Constable Pisani on 24 February 2009, ten days after the arrest, in a statement. Normally that prior consistent statement would be favourable material going to his credibility. However, in the ERISP (electronically recorded interview of suspected person) Detective Pisani put this question: 
     
      
      “...I’ll just make reference back to the search. Do you agree when you first emptied your pockets you were, two Nokia mobile phones were located on you ? 
       
      A. Yep. (Questions 118, 119 voir dire Exhibit 6). 
      
    19. In the facts tendered before the Magistrate no reference was made to the mobile phone being on the bench and being a factor that had aroused suspicion. I am satisfied Constable Pisani’s evidence is based upon the contents of his statement made ten days after the arrest. I am satisfied he did not use or refer to the ERISP when he made his statement. I am satisfied his memory when he made his statement was faulty and incorrect. I am satisfied the phones played no part in grounding the suspicion of the officers. 20. According to Coates the conversations between the police on the one hand and the accused and his friend on the other occurred before the search was embarked upon. 21. The Crown has tendered, without objection, Constable Pisani’s statement. In paragraph 8 of the statement in addition to the dilated eyes and white paste, Pisani noted the accused’s leg was shaking and he was clenching his jaw. These observations are listed as occurring during the conversation. Given that I have found the police identified themselves at commencement of the conversation the accused’s awareness that he had possession of a small container secreted in his underwear, on the accused’s own account that he was to hide or hold until its owner returned and that he “sort of guessed pills were in it” I am satisfied these two symptoms were observed by Pisani during the conversation. 22. At the point in time when Constable Pisani told Constable Coates that “we will go over and have a talk” to the men, he did not have enough “to stop” the men for any purpose let alone to search them. 23. While the nightclub’s reputation may have been tainted by some association with drugs that would be insufficient to select customers at random for search. Nor was the fact that the two men made their way down a laneway less brilliantly lit than the front of the club. Nor was the fact that both men looked over shoulders as they walked down the laneway at 2am. In a metropolis such as Sydney where street crime is not unknown it may have been prudent to do so. That the two men were pointed out as being of interest for a particular reason by another police officer, could not supply reasonable grounds for suspicion. That both men sat and had a cigarette is not a fact that can be taken as encouragement to form suspicion. Nor do all of these facts taken together supply enough to entitle police to stop, search or detain. 24. There seems to be evidence arising from cross-examination that supports Pisani’s remark that the police were going to talk to the two men. There is conversation about Good Vibrations and Chinese Laundry. The evidence puts all conversation as taking about three minutes before the search. The cross-examination seems to suggest, and I am prepared to accept, the conversation about bands and venues occurred before there was a demand made for search. I accept that this was a device used by police to engage, at some level, the men for the purpose of giving police an opportunity to test whether they should go further. It would make sense that the questions re drug use were closer to the search than the general ..(fault in recording equipment..); (read “questions being asked”) as Pisani was making up his mind to search the men.25. In the absence of questions, therefore, and evidence about the precise point of time Constable Pisani determined to order the search I can only express my finding this way. 26. The evidence has not established that the accused was “stopped” by police; that is, that he was required to stay in the company of police until the questions about using drugs were asked. Put another way, the defence has failed to establish that the two men were “stopped” for some police purpose at or during that first point of early contact by police. I am satisfied once the questions about drugs were asked, Constable Pisani’s purpose was no longer to “talk to them” but rather to cause each to be searched at his direction and by his subordinate. I am satisfied at least from that point both men were “stopped” by police.27. Once the drug question was asked, which may have been one and a half or so minutes into the conversation, he had noticed the dilated pupils, the white paste, the trembling leg and the clenched jaw. The more significant symptoms are the dilation of the eyes and presence of the paste in the corners of the mouth at 2.15am. While the significance of the dilation of the eyes has been put in issue, as capable of having an explanation inconsistent with drugs, in combination with other symptoms, the officer was entitled to take it into account. These symptoms could now be put into the context created by time, location and circumstance as giving to the symptoms I have isolated additional force.28. The defence argue the absence of white paste at 4.19am invites an inference that it was also absent at 2.15am. Such an inference is far from compelling, particularly given the ease with which such paste could be removed consciously or otherwise by a pensive rub of the corner of the mouth with thumb and index finger. The defence seeks to negate the dilation of the eyes as being caused by amphetamine use by relying upon a urine screening done on 16 February; that is, the day following the arrest. Two matters arise. Firstly, there is no evidence of dissipation time for amphetamines in the urine. Many drugs disappear from the urine relatively quickly, for example, GBH. Some last longer, eg cannabis, but absent expert evidence I am unable to find that the accused was not under the influence of a drug.29. Frankly, I am not able to find that he was either, but the onus was on the defence to prove that he was not. I should say such a proposition gains strength if one takes into account the custody notation that he did not appear to be under the influence of drug or alcohol in his favour. While his responses in the record of interview were relatively monosyllabic, there did not appear to be any deportment issues suggesting that he was other than sober and perhaps tired, but it is a mistake to think that the police officer had to find he was under the influence of drugs. It is sufficient if the officer, viewing the symptoms with others, has reasonable grounds for suspecting possession of a prohibited drug by the accused.30. The question to be determined, then, is at the point in time when I am satisfied the accused had been stopped, was there sufficient grounds for suspecting the accused possessed prohibited drugs. The seminal judgment from the CCA on this matter is a judgment of Acting Justice Smart in Rondo. After reviewing a number of cases, his Honour said at para (53): 
     
      
      “These propositions emerge: 
       
       
      (a) A reasonable suspicion involves less than a reasonable belief, but more than a possibility. There must be something, which would create in the mind of a reasonable person an apprehension or fear of one of the state of affairs covered by section 357E (the section at that time relating to the powers to stop search and detain). A reason to suspect that a fact exists is more than a reason to consider a look into the possibility of its existence. 
       
       
      (b) Reasonable suspicion is not arbitrary. Some factual basis for the suspicion must be shown. A suspicion may be based on hearsay material, or materials which may be inadmissible in evidence. The materials must have some probative value. 
       
       
      (c) What is important is the information in the mind of the police officer stopping the person or vehicle, or making the arrest at the time he did so. Having ascertained that information, the question is whether that information afforded reasonable grounds for the suspicion which the police officer formed. In answering that question, regard must be had to the source of the information and its content seen in the light of the whole of the surrounding circumstances.” 
       
      
    31. It should be noted that there is a difference between “suspicion” and “proof” and whilst the suspicion must be reasonable, there is a long way between reasonable suspicion and even proof on the balance of probabilities.32. There is no requirement for the officer to have formulated in his mind any potential conduct other than the suspicion of possession of the illicit drugs. He does not have to determine whether any drugs that might be found were for own use, to be supplied, or to be kept for some other person. 33. Given the symptoms observed by Pisani, the location, time and context of the circumstances, I am satisfied such suspicion as he entertained qualified as more than a mere possibility, and would have created in the mind of a reasonable person a suspicion that the accused was in possession of a drug in contravention of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. I am satisfied the information before the police officer afforded reasonable grounds for the suspicion he formed.34. Constable Coates, who conducted the search, put his belief like this -“I suspected that he was in possession of illegal drugs.” Constable Coates was at the time a probationary constable. He was required to act in accordance with directions given by a superior police officer. In my view, it is the decision of Constable Pisani that is important, as he was the one who was responsible for the stopping, ordered the search and the detaining following that order for the purposes of the search. If I be wrong, it will still follow that I regard Probationary Constable Coates as being equally aware of the dilated pupils and white paste, and that his suspicion was founded on reasonable grounds.35. I find the defence has failed to prove any impropriety or contravention of any Australian law by either officer. That being so, the defence are unable to call in aid s 138 of the Evidence Act 1995 or other related sections of the Evidence Act 1995. The application to exclude the evidence of the search, and drugs found upon the accused, is excluded.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to a charge of manufacturing not less than the commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, namely methylamphetamine (8.869 kilograms) contrary to s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The maximum penalty for this offence is life imprisonment and attracts a standard non-parole period of 15 years. 
     
      
    2 The applicant was sentenced to 12 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 9 years.  
     
      
    3 At the time the applicant was sentenced the sentencing judge also sentenced another offender, Song Lin. Song Lin had pleaded guilty to an offence of being knowingly concerned in the manufacture of a commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. The maximum penalty for that offence is 25 years imprisonment and attracts a standard non-parole period of 10 years. Song Lin was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 8 years with a non-parole period of 6 years. 
     
      
    4 There was another co-offender Kam Wing Lo who had been previously sentenced for an offence of being an aider and abetter to the applicant’s offence of manufacturing a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine. He was sentenced by the same judge who sentenced the applicant and Song Lin to a head sentence of 6 years with a non-parole period of 4 years. The offence being contrary to s 27 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act, carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. 
     
      
    5 Song Lin sought leave to appeal his sentence to this Court. Leave was granted and the appeal upheld and Song Lin was resentenced to a term of 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years. This Court found that Song Lin had a justifiable sense of grievance having regard to the sentence imposed on Lo, the court being satisfied that their criminality was of the same order. Lo also received the benefit of a finding of special circumstances. This Court was satisfied that because it was his first time in custody, his family are in China and he will not have the benefit of their visits to support him his sentence will be more burdensome than for the usual prisoner. The court was satisfied that these matters justified a finding of special circumstances and accordingly reduced the non-parole period which would otherwise have been imposed. 
     
      
    6 The applicant originally raised only one ground of appeal. However, he subsequently raised a further ground relating to statements he had made to a psychologist, Mr John Taylor, and evidence he had given to the sentencing judge in relation to his criminal history in Hong Kong. Accordingly, the grounds of appeal which were ultimately pursued are as follows: 
     
      
       
      Having regard to the sentences imposed on the co-offenders proper application of the parity principle requires that there be an appropriate adjustment downwards of the applicant’s non-parole period and head sentence. 
       
       
      The sentence proceedings miscarried by reason of the consequences flowing from the advice given to the applicant by his legal advisers: 
       
       
      (a) what he should say to psychologist Mr John Taylor when asked questions about his criminal history, and; 
       
       
      (b) what he should say when asked in evidence for his explanation as to why he did not disclose his criminal history to Mr Taylor. 
       
      
    7 When sentencing the applicant his Honour gave careful consideration to the circumstances in which the offences were committed. His Honour made the following findings in relation to the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Lau arrived in Australia on 15 December 2004 and flew to Sydney a couple of days later. He was arrested on 2 January 2005 at the premises which had been obtained as a base for the manufacturing process. He is a citizen of the Peoples Republic of China and a resident of Hong Kong. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Lau was the person who was responsible for extracting the methylamphetamine from methylamphetamine hydrochloride, which had been hidden inside a number of electrical capacitor shells. The idea was that the material would be removed from the shells and mixed with water to dissolve the methylamphetamine. This was to be filtered and then heated, which would lead to methylamphetamine crystals being formed when the solution was cooled. By that process the total quantity of methylamphetamine which could have been produced from the materials that were discovered by police when they arrested the offenders was 8.8698 kilograms. The charge to which Mr Lau pleaded guilty was the manufacture of that quantity of methylamphetamine. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Lau gave evidence that he only learned that he had been given the task of manufacturing the methylamphetamine once he came to Australia. He said that a Triad organisation had asked him to bring some filter papers to Australia and that he agreed because of concerns as to what would happen to him if he refused. Once here, Mr Lau’s evidence was, that he then discovered that he also had to be responsible for the separation of the methylamphetamine from the methylamphetamine hydrochloride and he had to make telephone calls to others on a daily basis, because he had no expertise in so doing. I reject this as being not a reasonably possible version of events. It is beyond comprehension that Mr Lau would be tasked with the manufacturing process unless he had some ability or expertise. This was not some amateur operation involving a relatively worthless substance. On the contrary, this was a sophisticated enterprise involving considerable expense and the prospect of a large profit. The task of manufacturing the essential product would not, I am satisfied, be placed in the hands of a person who is naïve and inexperienced as Mr Lau said he was. I find that Mr Lau knew before he came to Australia that he was to act as the cook, he being chosen because he knew what to do.” 
        
       
      
    8 In relation to Song Lin his Honour found that it was appropriate to sentence him for his role as a “general dog’s body”, as he did not know that more than 1 kilogram of methylamphetamine was to be produced. His Honour was influenced in making this finding by the fact that Song Lin had been charged with the offence of knowingly taking part in the manufacture of less than 1 kilogram of methylamphetamine being a commercial quantity rather than a large commercial quantity, with which the applicant was charged. The sentencing judge said that, although the reasons were not apparent, he must assume that the decision to charge the lesser offence was soundly based. In this Court it was acknowledged that the Crown could not prove that Song Lin knew that a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine was being manufactured.  
     
      
    9 In this Court it was submitted that Song Lin played a similar role in the offending as did Lo. Because Song Lin’s sentence was one third greater, with a non-parole period half as long again as Lo’s, it was submitted that the sentencing judge had fallen into error. It was submitted that Song Lin had no role in the manufacturing process and was prevented from seeing the process or having access to plans. This Court accepted that the applicant in the present proceedings had refused to share significant information with Lin, whose role was limited to purchasing and on one occasion modifying some equipment. Otherwise, he drove the applicant and Lo around the city and accompanied them to various tourist locations. 
     
      
    10 Accordingly, this Court concluded that Song Lin had a justifiable sense of grievance in relation to the sentence imposed on Lo and reduced his sentence accordingly. As I have indicated a finding of special circumstances was also made. 
     
      
    11 The applicant submitted to this Court that his sentence should also be reduced. I do not accept that submission.  
     
      
    12 It was submitted that the evidence established that he was simply employed as a cook, had not been extensively involved in organising the set up of the operation and had no interest in the profit to be made from the product. Emphasis was also placed on the fact that by reason of the evidence of telephone intercept material which suggested that the operation was not efficiently conducted, his Honour should have concluded that the disorganisation came from the applicant’s inexperience in the whole production process. Accordingly, it was submitted that the offence falls in the lower end of the scale for this type of offending.  
     
      
    13 I am not persuaded that apart from one matter this Court should intervene with regard to the applicant’s sentence. Apart from the fact, which is of great significance, that the applicant pleaded guilty to the greater offence involving a large commercial quantity of methylamphetamine which carried a maximum sentence of life imprisonment with a non-parole period of 15 years, the factual findings made by the sentencing judge were open to him and justify the sentence which was imposed. It is plain that he was in control of the Australian manufacturing processes. Both the charge and his significance to the process mean that the appropriate sentence had to be significantly greater than the sentences imposed on his co-offender. 
     
      
    14 Although I am not persuaded that this Court should intervene in relation to the overall sentence, I am satisfied that having regard to the finding of special circumstances which this Court made in relation to Song Lin, if that finding is not also made in relation to the applicant he would have a justifiable sense of grievance. In Taiana v R [2006] NSWCCA 398 this Court considered the principles with respect to non-parole periods and issues of parity. Howie J referred to his judgment in R v Do [2005] NSWCCA 209 where his Honour repeated his remarks in R v Wahabzadah [2001] NSWCCA 253 in which he said that he did not believe “that there is any breach of the principle of parity, simply because different non-parole periods are specified for different co-offenders because of different findings as to the existence, or extent, of special circumstances” [15]. 
     
      
    15 Because a finding of special circumstances reflects the personal characteristics of an offender, which will commonly differ between co-offenders, disparity is unlikely to be found in relation to a finding of special circumstances in relation to one co-offender and not another. However, Howie J accepted, as I do that there may be cases where all relevant facts and circumstances being equal, a finding of special circumstances in the case of one offender and not in the other may give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance. 
     
      
    16 In my view the personal circumstances of the applicant and of Song Lin are relevantly indistinguishable. The applicant came to Australia only a few weeks before he was arrested for the offence. Like Song Lin his family are in China and he will not have the benefit of their visits to support him. Although Song Lin could point to the fact that he was imprisoned for the first time, which is not true of the applicant, who has served a prison sentence in Hong Kong, nevertheless his personal circumstances are such that his sentence will be served harder than for the average prisoner. He has little English and his difficulty in communicating will also impact upon the harshness of his period of incarceration. 
     
      
    17 In the ordinary course I would not have been prepared to intervene to adjust the applicant’s non-parole period. However, I am satisfied that unless this Court does intervene the applicant will be left with a justifiable sense of grievance because of the relationship between his non-parole period and his overall sentence. The appropriate adjustment is to reduce the non-parole period to a term of 8 years. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    18 The solicitors acting for the applicant arranged for him to be examined by a psychologist, Mr John Taylor, who prepared a report which was tendered before the sentencing judge. Mr Taylor records in his report that “[the applicant] stated that he does not have any previous criminal convictions.” His report was prepared upon this assumption. 
     
      
    19 The applicant gave evidence before the sentencing judge. However, on an occasion when the matter was briefly before his Honour relevant documents were tendered. They included the applicant’s record of offending in Hong Kong.  
     
      
    20 The sentencing judge identified the fact that the record was not consistent with what the applicant had told the psychologist. When his Honour raised the matter the solicitor acting for the applicant, Mr Goold said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Your Honour that has occurred to me your honour.” 
        
       
      
    21 At a later hearing the applicant gave evidence. Mr Goold asked him about his meeting with the psychologist and why it was he had failed to disclose to Mr Taylor his criminal record in Hong Kong. During that exchange the sentencing judge intervened. The relevant transcript is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: In preparation for your plea of guilty and your sentence today Mr Lau, did you also speak with a psychologist by the name of Mr Taylor? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Is it the case that he asked you did you have a criminal record? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You answered no? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: When he asked you that question, to what did you believe he was referring? 
         
        A: I think I misunderstood that his question in relation to whether I have any criminal record in Australia. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You do not have a criminal record in Australia presently do you? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: But you have a criminal record elsewhere, is that correct? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What is that record? 
         
        A: When I was young I had committed a robbery offence. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Where was that? 
         
        A: In Hong Kong. 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR: 
        
       
       
        
        Q: I think you also had other matters in Hong Kong, apart from a robbery offence though didn’t you Mr Lau? 
         
        A: Yes I had been fined in the past. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: What for? 
         
        A: As far as I remember is cigarette for which Customs have not been paid. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Any drug matters? 
         
        A: I have been transporting sleeping medication from China to Hong Kong. 
        
       
       
        
        GOOLD 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Did you also have a matter relating to false identity documents? 
         
        A: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: There is nothing else that you can recall, other than the one his Honour has reminded you of and what I have reminded you of? 
         
        A: No.” 
        
       
      
    22 The sentencing judge formed an adverse view of the applicant. In the course of his sentencing remarks his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        The psychologist also reported, and I quote, ‘Mr Lau stated that he has not previously been convicted of any criminal offence.’ That is not true. Indeed, he has a significant criminal history from Hong Kong. When asked to explain this discrepancy in the witness box the offender claimed that he misunderstood what the psychologist was asking him and believed he was only being asked about offences in Australia. Then, when giving evidence before me, he was asked whether he had any other convictions. Mr Lau failed to mention, until I prompted him, some of the offences which he had committed whilst in Hong Kong. I am satisfied that he was deliberately untruthful to the psychologist and attempted to mislead me concerning his prior criminal activities. The psychologist’s interview was conducted with the aid of an interpreter and the offender had similar assistance whilst giving his evidence in court. I do not believe that it is credible in those circumstances that the offender would have misunderstood what was being asked of him, either in court or in the interview.” 
        
       
      
    23 The applicant gave evidence in this Court in which he accepted that when he said to the sentencing judge: “I think I misunderstood that his question in relation to whether I have any criminal record in Australia” he had lied. Because of the short time the applicant had been in Australia the lie was self-evident and, as his Honour found, his explanation incredible. 
     
      
    24 The applicant said that he had made this response because of advice he had received from his solicitor Mr Goold and his assistant, Mr Ting. In an affidavit the applicant said that he was advised by Mr Ting not to tell the psychologist about his Hong Kong convictions. He said that he was told by the solicitor:  
     
      
       
        
        “We will first look at the police brief to see if the Hong Kong police have forwarded your Hong Kong criminal convictions to the Australian police and to the Australian court. If they have, then we will retrieve the old psychologist report, and we will arrange a new psychologist report, and then you can disclose to the new psychologist in that new report that you had previous convictions in Hong Kong. I can control this part of the information.” 
        
       
      
    25 The applicant said that when he later became aware that Mr Taylor’s report had been tendered and that the sentencing judge had received a copy of his criminal record from Hong Kong he was surprised and asked Mr Ting how it had happened. He said that Mr Ting responded that there was no need to worry and that:  
     
      
       
        
        “The only option now is to explain to the judge how it happened. On the next occasion we go to court, just tell the judge you have a criminal record in Hong Kong but when the psychologist came to do the report, the psychologist was Australian, he spoke English, there was a problem with communication, and that you misunderstood what the interpreter said, and that you thought he asked whether you had a criminal conviction in Australia. Just explain this to the judge. If you lie to reduce your sentence, the Australian legal system accepts this because your motive is to reduce your sentence, to protect yourself. You’re not hurting anyone in the process. Even if the judge does not accept your explanation, it should not matter that much, it will only increase your sentence by 6 months to 1 year. This sort of thing is very common/normal because you have a record in Hong Kong, not Australia. Even if the judge knows of your record, it should not have any great impact on your sentence.” 
        
       
      
    26 The applicant said that when the matter was dealt with in court and the sentencing judge expressed his disbelief he was concerned. He also said that he had been advised that he would receive a lesser sentence than that which the judge imposed. I infer that he believes the judge increased his sentence because he had been found to tell untruths. 
     
      
    27 The essential allegations in the applicant’s account of the relevant conversations are denied both by Mr Ting and Mr Goold. 
     
      
    28 Mr Goold says he was first made aware that the applicant had not told Mr Taylor of his criminal record in Hong Kong when the matter was raised by him with Mr Ting after the latter had visited the applicant at Silverwater. Mr Goold said that if the applicant’s explanation was that he had misunderstood Mr Taylor’s question and believed he was only being asked about his Australian convictions, the applicant would have to tell the truth and give this evidence before his Honour. 
     
      
    29 Mr Goold denies ever giving the applicant advice that he should give false evidence before the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    30 Mr Ting also denied the allegations made by the applicant. In relation to a number of the conversations in which the applicant said that advice was given to him not to tell Mr Taylor of his convictions and give the trial judge a false explanation for his response to Mr Taylor, he said that these conversations never occurred. He denied ever giving the applicant advice to lie.  
     
      
    31 There are some aspects of Mr Ting’s evidence which have required careful consideration. Although the applicant gave evidence that Mr Ting took notes of their conversations Mr Ting says that he did not do so. Given the nature of the instructions which Mr Ting was receiving in relation both to the offence and the applicant’s personal circumstances this is surprising. If true it does not reflect well on Mr Ting’s professional competence. I have also reflected on the fact that the applicant gives evidence of receiving advice which contemplated a complex sequence of events. He said he was told that if the sentencing judge became aware of his Hong Kong record the report from Mr Taylor would not be relied upon and a further report from a psychologist who had been told the truth would be obtained. I have been troubled as to whether it is likely that the applicant would have entirely fabricated advice of this character. 
     
      
    32 Notwithstanding my reservations it is important to remember that the applicant has a significant criminal record for offences which involve dishonest conduct. Unless I was firmly of the view that he was telling the truth his account of the relevant events cannot be accepted: see Briginshaw v Briginshaw (1938) 60 CLR 336. 
     
      
    33 Notwithstanding the matters to which I have referred I am not persuaded that the solicitor’s accounts of the events should be rejected and the applicant accepted. 
     
      
    34 No doubt the applicant’s concern to raise these matters was occasioned by the comments made upon this issue by the sentencing judge in his remarks. I have recorded the relevant comments at [22] above. The applicant believes the adverse view which his Honour formed of his integrity has influenced the length of the sentence. 
     
      
    35 I am not satisfied that the applicant’s understanding of the situation is correct. In the remarks on sentence his Honour makes findings in relation to the applicant’s role in the offences before raising his concerns in relation to his untruthful response to the psychologist and his attempt to mislead his Honour. It is the earlier findings that inform his Honour’s decision that the objective seriousness of the offence is in the middle of the range. 
     
      
    36 Irrespective of whether his Honour’s adverse view of the applicant’s credit was affected by the fact that he gave false evidence, I am satisfied that his Honour’s finding with respect to the circumstances of the offence and its objective seriousness were appropriate. Although it is understandable that the applicant may believe that his Honour’s concerns may have been reflected in his factual findings I am not satisfied this is the case. 
     
      
    37 In relation to the applicant’s subjective circumstances, leaving to one side that his Honour did not think he had given honest evidence, the applicant’s lack of integrity was made patent by the offences he had committed both in Hong Kong and in the instant offence. A finding that he had deliberately attempted to mislead the sentencing judge in relation to his prior record would have been of little if any consequence. 
     
      
    38 The concern which his Honour expressed was not so much in relation to the applicant’s response that he believed the psychologist was asking about his Australian convictions but, rather, when asked to disclose his convictions in Hong Kong the applicant was not forthcoming in relation to either or all of the offences he had committed or their relative seriousness. On any version of the events by the time the applicant was giving evidence before his Honour he had been advised that he must tell the truth. It is apparent that his Honour formed the view that even after he had been advised to this effect the applicant was still not truthful. This finding was open to his Honour and I am not persuaded this Court could set it aside. 
     
      
    39 Accordingly to the extent that his Honour’s opinion of the applicant’s truthfulness influenced the sentencing outcome it seems to me to have been justified irrespective of the advice given by the solicitor. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
       
      1. I would grant leave to appeal and quash the sentence imposed in the District Court. 
       
      2. The applicant should be sentenced to a non-parole period of 8 years with a total sentence of 12 years. The sentence is to commence on 2 January 2005 making the applicant eligible to be released to parole on 1 January 2013.

      JUDGMENT (No 2) 
       
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: 
       
      
    1 The accused was charged on indictment dated 6 February 2009 that on 28 July 2005 she did murder her infant son, Zane Doolan, who was then aged five weeks. 
     
      
    2 On 5 March 2010, I delivered reasons for judgment, the hearing being a judge alone trial. In the judgment, I concluded that the infant victim died by drowning as a result of having been placed face down by the accused in a bathtub and her action in turning on the tap over the bath. 
     
      
    3 As recorded in the judgment of 5 March 2010, the Crown was required to establish beyond reasonable doubt:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The death of the child. 
       
       
      (2) Whether or not the death of the child was caused by the actions of the accused by drowning him in the bath or placing him in the bath in a way that would cause him to drown. 
       
       
      (3) That, at the relevant time, the accused had an intention to kill the child or to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
       
      
    4 On behalf of the accused, Ms L Wells SC contended that the evidence in the Crown case did not establish the second of the above three elements of the offence. On a review of the evidence and submissions, I concluded that the issue of causation could not be determined on the basis of statements that had been made by the accused, given that the statements had no or little reliability for reasons stated in the judgment. However, I concluded that the Crown had discharged the onus of proof on it in relation to the issue of causation to the requisite standard by reason of the evidence that established the particular factual matters as set out in paragraph [105] of the judgment. 
     
      
    5 A defence of mental illness was raised on behalf of the accused. A finding was made that on the evidence the accused was not guilty by reason of mental illness and an order was accordingly made for the accused’s detention pursuant to s.39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (“the Act”). 
     
      
    6 Following the making of the last-mentioned finding and order, the Crown raised the question as to the absence of an express finding as to the intention of the accused, although the Crown Prosecutor observed that it was implicit from the other findings in the judgment. 
     
      
    7 Ms Wells raised a question as to whether there could be a positive finding made as to the intention of the accused in circumstances in which I had determined that no reliance could be placed upon the accused’s statements, being the statements identified in paragraphs [89] to [100] of the judgment. The Crown Prosecutor then proposed that, in order to provide Ms Wells with an opportunity of considering whether or not she wished to make any application, I set aside the finding and order made under s.39 of the Act. Ms Wells supported the Crown’s proposed course of action. 
     
      
    8 I determined to proceed accordingly and set aside the finding and order. I adjourned the proceedings to Thursday 11 March 2010. 
     
      
       
      Application for the accused 
       
      
    9 Ms Wells, by written submissions dated 10 March 2010, made application to make further submissions on behalf of the accused concerning the element of intent on the charge of murder. 
     
      
    10 Ms Wells initially addressed the question of jurisdiction and contended that the Court was not functus officio and was in the position to hear the further submissions. 
     
      
    11 Reference was made in that respect to authority on what constituted a conviction for the purposes of a plea in bar of autrefois convict in Regina v Stone (2005) 64 NSWLR 413 in which the decision in S v Recorder of Manchester [1971] AC 481 at 489 was cited. It was submitted that the vacated finding in the present proceedings would be treated as provisional, allowing for the receipt of further submissions. 
     
      
    12 Senior counsel for the accused stated that she did not seek to traverse the findings made that the accused caused the death of her child, nor that she should not be found not guilty by reason of mental illness. Further, no issue was taken with the finding that the statements of admission were made by the accused as to the events surrounding the death of her child were so unreliable as to attract little or no weight at all. 
     
      
    13 Consequently, the application was to place detailed submission on the issue of intention. On the further hearing of this matter on 11 March 2010, Ms Wells confirmed that she had no objection to me proceeding to determine that issue. 
     
      
       
      Submissions for the accused on “intention” 
       
      
    14 It was submitted on behalf of the accused that the available alternatives on the element of intent were:- 
     
      
       
      (1) In relation to the finding of murder:- 
       
       
        
        (a) reckless indifference to human life – the foreseeing of an act that is probable as distinct from possible that death will result from that act; 
        
       
       
        
        (b) an intention to kill or do grievous bodily harm. 
        
       
       
      (2) It was also contended that a further alternative was the offence of manslaughter by criminal negligence, namely, an act or omission which so far fell short of the standard of care required by a reasonable person, that it went beyond a matter of civil wrong and amounts to a crime. Such an offence requires a very high degree of negligence. 
       
      
    15 The submission was that, on the evidence in this case, a finding could not be reasonably made that the accused had the intent to kill her child. The evidence relevant to the question of intent was entirely circumstantial. 
     
      
    16 Ms Wells accepted that the deceased child’s body was found face down in the bathtub with the tap turned on, the child being only five weeks old at the time and that the accused was the only person who could have placed the child in that position. However, it was contended that, in relation to the proof of the element of intention, that the only witness who found the child’s body, Howard Dennis, was unable to say with any certainty how much, if any, water was found in the bath, other than the water that was running from the tap. Reference was made to evidence given by Howard Dennis in cross-examination when he said there was no water in the bathtub at the time he found the baby in the bath. 
     
      
    17 Reliance was also placed upon the fact that Howard Dennis was consistent in saying there was no plug in the bath. Subsequent investigation of the scene showed the plug on the shelf in the bathroom. Ms Wells, in oral submissions, stated that the absence of a plug in the bathtub went to the issue as to what the accused intended. If she had intended to kill the child, Ms Wells stated, one would think that she would have put the plug in the bathtub and filled the tub with a quantity of water. 
     
      
    18 Reliance was placed on the evidence of Professor Roger W Byard who, in his report (p.3), stated that death by drowning can occur very rapidly in a very small amount of water, as little as five centimetres. This was said to be less than most people might reasonably anticipate. 
     
      
    19 In the written submissions, the position for the accused on the question of intent was expressed as follows:- 
     
      
       
        
        “10. It is submitted for the accused that this evidence falls short of proof beyond reasonable doubt of an intention to kill. The presence of an intent to kill may have been demonstrated or accepted beyond reasonable doubt had the baby been found floating or face down in a quantity of water. The scenario described by the witness, Dennis, of there being no water in the bath and no plug is far more consistent with proof of the element of either reckless indifference to human life (murder) or criminal negligence (manslaughter). The defence would urge a finding of the latter.” 
        
       
       
      Crown submissions 
       
      
    20 In the Crown submissions, it was noted that the Crown put its case to the Court for murder on the basis of intentional murder, alternatively, reckless indifference to human life. It was also noted that the Crown opened the alternative of manslaughter by criminal negligence. 
     
      
    21 Reference was made to the fact that, at the conclusion of the evidence, the issues addressed on behalf of the accused were, firstly, the issue of causation and, secondly, the defence of mental illness. However, the Crown also correctly observed that, whilst there was no address made on behalf of the accused in relation to the mental element, it was an element of the offence upon which I was required to be satisfied on the evidence presented. 
     
      
    22 In its submissions, the Crown set out, correctly (subject only to the fact there was one bath tap only turned on), the findings that had been made in the judgment delivered on 5 March 2010, namely:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The accused placed the child into the bath. 
         
         
        (b) The child was in the vicinity of the plug hole. 
         
         
        (c) The child was face down in the bath. 
         
         
        (d) The accused turned the bath taps into the bath on. 
         
         
        (e) The child was probably in the bath at the time that the community nurse called to the house, and could not gain entry about 10.45 am. 
        
       
       
        
        (f) The child was still in the bath face down with the taps running at about 12.45 pm when Howard Dennis entered the house and found the child. 
        
       
       
        
        (g) The child had died as a result of drowning.” 
         (Crown Submissions, pp.1-2) 
        
       
      
    23 On the threshold issue as to the jurisdiction of the Court to hear further submissions on the question of the accused’s intent, the Crown placed reliance on authority to the effect that, in the case of a jury verdict, a trial judge has a right and, in some cases, a duty, whether in a civil or a criminal cause, to tell the jury to reconsider their verdict and that a trial judge is not bound to receive the jury verdict unless they insist upon him doing so: Brown v The King (1913) 17 CLR 570, citing the rule expressed by Pollock CB in Meany’s case (at pp.591-592). 
     
      
    24 The Crown also referred to dicta in the joint judgment in Gibbons v Howley [1990] VR 762 (FC) and Regina v Ciantar (2006) 167 A Crim R 504 at 150-163. 
     
      
    25 The Crown submitted that the principles stated in the above cases provide sufficient authority for the Court vacating the verdict and the order made under s.39 of the Act. I accept the Crown’s submission in that respect. 
     
      
    26 The Crown did not seek to oppose senior counsel for the accused making further submissions on the question of intention. 
     
      
    27 In the written submissions, the Crown contended:- 
     
      
       
        
        “1. That in considering the evidence of Howard Dennis, the Court would find his description of what confronted him when he entered the bedroom as given on the day of the events more compelling than answers given in relation to cross-examination. His memory on the day of the events was clearly much fresher than when in the witness box and his mode of answering in the witness box tended to acquiesce with the proposition put. 
        
       
       
        
        2. In this regard, the Crown directs the attention of the Court to the following answers given in his electronically recorded interview at the police station on the day of the offence …” 
        
       
      
    28 The Crown then provided reference in the material contained in Exhibit A relating to the statements made by Howard Dennis during the course of his interview. 
     
      
    29 The Crown contended that, considering the circumstances as described, in particular by Howard Dennis, and the facts as found in the judgment given on 5 March 2010 (and consistent with the verdict announced), there was no reasonably hypothesis available inconsistent with guilt of murder. 
     
      
    30 The Crown, in oral submissions, emphasised that, on the basis of the findings made and expressed in the judgment of 5 March 2010, the evidence established that a clothed five week old baby had been placed face down into a bathtub with the tap turned on so that the water ran around the mouth of the child before exiting the bathtub via the plughole. Those facts, the Crown contended, meant that there was simply no other reasonable explanation than that the accused intended to kill the child or at least realised that it would probably drown in those circumstances because it would not be able to breathe by reason of the water running past his mouth and nose and death was a probability. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    31 In light of the submissions made, I have reviewed the evidence relevant to the circumstances concerning the death of the child. Howard Dennis was interviewed by the police on the day of the incident, 28 July 2005. In the electronically recorded interview (Exhibit A, tab 5, p.7), he said that he noted:- 
     
      
       
      • That there was water all over the floor when he walked in. 
       
       
      • Taps were running. 
       
       
      • He went into the bathroom but did not worry about turning the tap off when he saw the baby. 
       
       
      • He shortly thereafter grabbed the baby and took him to the lounge room. 
       
      
    32 Later in the interview, Howard Dennis, when asked to describe how much water was in the bathtub, said the child’s head was under the water and that his whole face would have been in the water. He also stated that the baby’s head was facing straight into the sink hole and there was no plug there. He confirmed that the tap was running and that, at some point, he leant over and turned the tap off (p.55). 
     
      
    33 At the committal hearing held on 11 December 2008, Howard Dennis, in chief, stated that the baby was lying face down in the bath in the plug hole, the water was still running and that the water was “… just running on top, the back of his head …” (p.41). He confirmed that there was no plug in the plug hole (p.52) and in cross-examination he confirmed that the water was running out of the tap onto the back of the baby’s head. He described the baby’s head facing straight into the sink hole and that “… he went down to the sink with the water or something” (p.54). 
     
      
    34 Howard Dennis was called to give evidence in the present proceedings on 4 February 2010. He confirmed in cross-examination that the taps were running in the bathroom and the kitchen and that there was quite a bit of water on the floor. It was put to him that he could not really remember how much water was in the bath on the day in question. He replied (transcript, p.95):- 
     
      
       
        
        “No, there was no water in the bath, it just cold water was hitting his head and - -  
        
       
       
        
        Q. So there was cold water hitting his head. What from? A. From the tap, the water …” 
        
       
      
    35 A little later he confirmed there was no water in the bathtub at the time although it is to be noted that this statement was made in the context of Howard Dennis saying the water was still flowing from the tap and hitting the baby’s head. 
     
      
    36 There is a variation in the evidence given in the present proceedings as to the fact that there was no water in the bath (although the tap was still running) and the account given by Howard Dennis to police on the day of the incident in which he suggested that there was water in the bath. Be that as it may, it is clear that his evidence has been consistent throughout that the tap in the bath was on, that it was emitting cold water and that the water was discharging into the bath in circumstances in which the baby was face down at or near the sink hole. The evidence in that respect indicated that the nose and the mouth of the baby were exposed to running water as it passed over his head and into the sink hole. In his interview, in answer to question 245, Howard Dennis replied “… was sort of cloggin’ the drain up, you know, from the water goin’ out …”. 
     
      
    37 The only medical evidence as to the quantity of water that can lead to drowning of an infant was, as earlier noted, the evidence of Professor Byard in his report dated 1 July 2007. In that report at p.3, Professor Byard stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “… The amount of water required to drown an infant may be quite small, with as little as 20 mls of fresh water per kilogram body weight resulting in significant electrolyte disturbances within several minutes. Children have drowned in as little as 5 cm of water in bathtubs …” 
        
       
      
    38 The evidence in the Crown case which I have again reviewed for the present application supports the following findings as to the actions of the accused and associated aspects:- 
     
      
       
      • The accused placed the baby into the bath face down specifically in that part of the bath where the sink hole was located. 
       
       
      • Either before or after doing so, she turned on the cold water tap thereby causing water to be discharged into the bath. 
       
       
      • The baby’s face in the downward position was located in the area of the sink hole. 
       
       
      • Water running from the tap ran into the bath for some considerable time, from at least 10.40 am on 28 July 2005 when Ms Cronin from the Bathurst Community Health Centre knocked on the door until Howard Dennis found the baby in the bath. 
       
       
      • During that period of time, water from the cold water tap flowed towards the sink hole where the baby’s face was located and, accordingly, to some degree accumulated in the area of the baby’s face before passing into or through the sink hole itself. 
       
       
      Specific intention 
       
      
    39 Where the Crown has to establish the act of the accused was done with a specific intent (that is, that he or she sought by that act to achieve a particular result), it is usual to direct a jury in the appropriate case that a person’s act may themselves provide the most convincing evidence of his or her intention. 
     
      
    40 Where it is put that a person who deliberately does such an act must have intended to inflict such injury, this is a statement that amounts to no more than an invitation to draw such an inference or conclusion because it is impossible to imagine from one’s experience of life what other result the accused, himself or herself, could have sought to achieve by that act: Regina v Stokes v Difford (1990) 51 A Crim 25 at 30. 
     
      
    41 The principle is that as a person is usually able to foresee what are the natural consequences of his or her acts, so it is, as a rule, reasonable to infer that he or she did foresee them and intend them: Deery v Deery (1953-1954) 90 CLR 211 at 230 per Dixon CJ. 
     
      
    42 In accordance with accepted principle where proof is required beyond reasonable doubt, any inference should not be drawn from direct evidence unless it is the only rational inference in the circumstances. Where a specific result is the obvious and inevitable consequence of a person’s act and where he or she deliberately does that act, then a conclusion may be drawn that the person did the act with the intention of achieving that specific result. 
     
      
    43 I have considered the submissions on behalf of the accused as to whether the facts proved in evidence could be said to establish what may be termed a reckless killing constituting murder or a negligent killing in the sense in which those terms are understood. See: Pemble v The Queen (1971) 124 CLR 107, 135. 
     
      
    44 The submissions made required a determination of the accused’s state of mind with which the fatal acts were done. The acts of the accused proved in evidence establishes, in my opinion, a state of mind beyond recklessness in the sense of an indifference to a result of which at least the likelihood is foreseen and, it follows, one which clearly excludes an alternative finding of a negligent killing constituting manslaughter. 
     
      
    45 In the present case, it was and would have been known to the accused even in her condition at the time that an infant who was placed face down with the nose and mouth placed in close proximity to, if not directly on, the sink hole in the bath with the tap turned on would not survive. 
     
      
    46 Notwithstanding the submissions of learned senior counsel for the accused as to possible alternative verdicts, the combination of the accused’s deliberate acts as established in evidence to the requisite standard, as I have found occurred, admits of only one conclusion, namely, that those acts were done by her with an actual intention of achieving the specific result or outcome to which I have referred, namely, that death would result from them. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    47 I am, as stated in paragraph [151] of the judgment delivered on 5 March 2010, satisfied that at the time of doing the acts causing death the accused was mentally ill so as not to be responsible in law for her acts and, accordingly, I am required to return a special verdict. Accordingly, on that basis, I confirm the finding made in paragraph [152] of that judgment that the accused is not guilty of the charge of murder by reason of mental illness. 
     
      
    48 I order that the accused be detained, pursuant to s.39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, in an appropriate correctional centre or such facility as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine until released by due process of law.  
     
      
    49 The Registrar is to notify the Minister of Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of the orders made by this Court.

    JUDGMENT1. In sentencing the offender, I have to maintain a balance between two considerations which pull in opposite directions. On the one hand, he has committed a series of crimes - some very serious - mostly against the same victim who has been traumatised by these crimes. On the other hand, he is still a young man of twenty-six years who had started dealing with his own behaviour at about the time of the last offences and who is well supported by a loving family. 2. The first consideration calls for heavy sentences to punish him for his extensive criminal behaviour. The second consideration restrains me from imposing sentences which would be so harsh that they would crush any desire and efforts to rehabilitate himself as he works towards the prospect of returning to healthy relationships in the community. Both Mr Moberley, who appeared as Crown Prosecutor in the trial and the sentence proceedings and Mr Thangaraj, who appeared for The offender, have acknowledged this tension and the risk of imposing a series of sentences which could arrest his steps towards rehabilitation.3. The offender and V formed a relationship when they were teenagers. They were high school sweethearts. The relationship was, for most of the time, not a healthy one.4. V, from what I could observe, seems to be an energetic, attractive young woman who wanted to enjoy a sound relationship with her boyfriend and participated in normal social activities with him. The offender, however, was possessive, jealous and emotionally dependent on his girlfriend, V. He was suffering from what has since been diagnosed as a ""personality disorder with strong dependent and avoidant features"".5. Over about eight years of this relationship, the offender abused V on a number of occasions. The abuse was verbal, physical, sexual and financial. The abuse came to a head on a particular day in 2008, when it was especially violent and V finally terminated the relationship and reported him to the police.6. The offender was charged with a large number of offences which ranged over a period from 2000 to 2008. He was tried by a jury on these charges last year and he was found not guilty of about half of them and was found guilty of half of them.7. I am sentencing him today for the offences that he was found guilty of and of which I have convicted him. If I have not yet convicted him, I convict him of each of the offences which I will refer to.HIS HONOUR: I am going to just suspend my remarks on sentence at the moment. I notice that we have got a fairly full public gallery including some school students, which is entirely appropriate. However I must mention that this is a case of the kind where the name of the victim, or any way of identifying her, are not allowed to be published outside this courtroom. The name is V, which you have all heard. That name is not to be repeated outside. It is against the law. Nor is any means or way of identifying her to be mentioned outside this courtroom. I will now return to my remarks on sentence.8. The offender was found guilty by the jury of three counts of intimidation with intent to cause fear of physical or mental harm. They were offences under s 562AB of the Crimes Act 1900 and each of them carried a maximum of five years imprisonment. One of the victims of those offences was V; a second, was her mother Mrs V and a third, her father, Mr V. They are respectively counts three, four and five on the indictment.9. Over the period of these offences, the law changed so that when The offender committed another offence of intimidating someone, the offence was under new legislation. He was charged with intimidating - to cause fear of physical harm - Mr S. That was an offence at the time under s 13(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007 and carried a maximum of five years imprisonment.10. In addition, he was charged with and found guilty of the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. That was count sixteen and is an offence against s 59 of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum of seven years imprisonment.11. He was also charged with larceny, that is stealing. The victim of both those offences was V. The second offence - of larceny which was charge seventeen on the indictment - is made an offence under s 117 of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum of five years imprisonment.12. Next he was charged with and found guilty of two offences involving the use of what is described as a taser-like device. He was charged with threatening to use an offensive weapon, namely a taser-like device, with intent to commit an indictable offence, namely intimidation. That was count twenty-four. That is an offence under s 33B(1)(a) of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum of twelve years imprisonment. Associated with that, he was charged with possessing a prohibited weapon, namely a taser-like device, without being authorised to do so by a permit. That was charge number twenty five. That was an offence under s 7(1) of the Weapons Prohibition Act 1998. It carries a maximum penalty of fourteen years. Not only that, Parliament regards it as so serious that it has fixed a standard non-parole period of three years to that offence.13. Next he was charged with two counts of demanding money with menaces. The victim in each case was V. He was charged with demanding $30,000 from V with menaces, which was charge eleven on the indictment, and with also demanding $20,000 from her which was charge twelve in the indictment. Each of those charges is an offence under s 99(1) of the Crimes Act and each carries a maximum of ten years imprisonment.14. In charge thirteen, he was charged with an additional count of assaulting V occasioning her actual bodily harm. That is an offence under s 59 of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum of five years imprisonment.15. He was charged by count twenty-three with taking V, without her consent, and with intent to obtain advantage namely the continuing relationship and at the time of bringing about actual bodily harm to her. That is an offence against s 86(2)(b) of the Crimes Act. It is commonly known as kidnapping. It carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. 16. Finally, he was charged and found guilty of having sexual intercourse with V without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting. That charge was number twenty-six on the indictment and is against s 61A of the Crimes Act and carries a maximum of fourteen years imprisonment. Once again, in that case, Parliament has seen fit to fix a standard non-parole period of seven years to that offence.17. I formally convict the offender of all of those offences that I have listed.18. It is important for any judge who is sentencing an offender to set out, usually briefly, what happened which caused the offender to be charged with a crime. I will now turn to briefly summarising what happened in each case which resulted in the offender being charged with these offences. 19. I will deal first with counts three, four, five and twenty-eight, all of which are the intimidation charges.20. The intimidation of V, which is the subject of count three, is described by her in her evidence as being hit by him, as punishment by him for disobeying him. She said there was lots of punching to the head, the arms and the legs and to the stomach. She said that she stayed in the relationship out of fear. She tried to break it off, but he would not let her go. That offence occurred over the period 1 January to 31 December 2002.21. Charge four is the intimidation of Mrs V which occurred over the same period and Mrs V describes it in terms of receiving telephone calls from The offender, during which he would swear at her. She pleaded with him lots of times to make him stop, but he went on swearing and, as she said he “didn't care the least.”22. Count five is the charge concerning the intimidation of Mr V, and Mrs V's evidence covers the same phone calls, some of which were obviously answered by Mr V. The intimidation of Mr V occurred over the same period, namely 1 January to 31 December 2002.23. The charge of intimidation of Mr S is said to have occurred between 1 September and 15 September 2008. The offender phoned Mr S. The offender knew that Mr S had gone out with V a few times. The offender said that Mr S should stay away from V and when asked whether he was trying to threaten him said “I'd advise you not to go down this road.”24. Turning now to counts sixteen and seventeen, count sixteen was an assault occasioning actual bodily harm. The evidence about that came from V, the victim of the assault. It occurred on 10 September 2008. She said that she was slapped in the face and fell to the ground. On the ground, he kicked her three or four times in her thigh area because she had started seeing somebody else. She was bruised and produced a photograph of that bruised area.25. Count seventeen was a larceny. It occurred on the same date, 10 September 2008. The offender took V's mobile telephone and took the SIM card out and replaced with a new SIM card, which he had purchased. He then said to her “You don't fucking have anyone now, your two friends don't exist.” In addition he said “I am taking total control now.” She was crying but did not argue. He was very angry and she was very scared. He never gave her back that SIM card, despite the fact that it had “all my contact numbers.” He refused to give it back to her.26. Counts twenty-four and twenty-five both occurred on 22 September 2008. This was on the day when the relationship was terminated. The offender and V were sitting in a car together and he pulled out, as V described it, what she regarded as a taser gun. She said that he “put it near my thigh and he said to me 'If I zapped this on your vagina, you won't be able to conceive children'.” She identified the taser-like device which was tendered in evidence which was put close to her. She knew that it was in working order because he had turned it on and it made a noise, a zapping noise.27. Count twenty-five was constituted by the fact that he had that device without being authorised to do so. 28. The two counts of demanding money with menaces were the subject of counts eleven and twelve. The first occurred between 1 August 2007 and 23 August 2007. The offender asked for some money. He demanded $25,000 of V. He asked her to apply for a loan. She said that she did not have enough money. He said that he needed the money and “I need you to apply for a loan and I'll leave you alone.” She applied for the loan because “he was harassing and because he promised me he'd leave me alone.” She went to the bank and arranged for a loan and handed over the money to him. In fact the amount that she handed over was $30,000.29. Count twelve - the same offence - occurred between 25 August and 14 September 2007 and occurred after he said he needed more money. In demanding more money from her, he said that he needed just “one more amount and I promise I'll leave you alone.” Despite her saying that she would not be able to secure an additional loan, believing that he would leave her alone, she approached another bank and borrowed $20,000 which she handed over to the offender.30. The assault occasioning actual bodily harm, which is the subject of count thirteen, occurred on 29 December 2007. She got in his car and found that he was angry. He told her to pull her pants down, he grabbed a lighter and lit it for a while. It was a cigarette lighter. He put it on to her right buttock and burned her with it, twice. The first time he left it longer, she started screaming and jumped from the seat because of the pain. The second time it was thought not as long. A photograph shows the burn mark and scars from the lighter. She is still conscious of having that mark, present from that offence.31. As I have said, the relationship was terminated on 22 September 2008 when matters came to a head between the two. V had been off work for some time and was making an effort to go back to work. She did not want to make contact with the offender and made all efforts to avoid him. She went to catch a bus to work. The offender was obviously waiting for her. He approached her and forced her into his car.32. He locked the car and V found that she could not get out because of the fact that the car was locked. He told her to give him oral sex which she said she did. Part of that was the subject of a video used or captured by the offender, where he required her to say certain things about the fact that she was giving him oral sex which involved her sucking his erect penis at his direction. When asked why she did in fact suck his penis, she said that she did so because “he forced me to and because, again, I was frightened. I didn't know what to do.”33. This occurred, as I said, in the offender's car which had been driven to a parked area after he required her to get into the car. Hence he was charged with count twenty-three of kidnapping her and with count twenty-six of having sexual intercourse with her, again without her consent, knowing that she was not consenting.34. It is important, for a judge to take into account the effect of criminal behaviour upon the victim of any offence. In this case, V has provided a victim impact statement. She regards herself as finding it very difficult to trust people, especially men. She feels frightened. She lost a lot of weight and suffered from anxiety and depression. She still gets flashbacks and describes herself as having a burn scar on her right buttock so that “every time I change, I am reminded of the day [the offender] burnt me with his cigarette lighter.” She feels humiliated and is in debt for $50,000. 35. The Crown Prosecutor tendered a document containing The offender's criminal record which comprises just one offence of shoplifting which occurred in 2002 and which I regard as having no impact upon my sentencing of him.36. I have been assisted by submissions from both Mr Thangaraj and Mr Moberley about the sentences which I should impose.37. As to the intimidation counts and the assault resulting in bruising and larceny, Mr Thangaraj submitted that they should result in non-custodial sentences. Mr Moberley submitted that there is no alternative, but to sentence The offender to custody for those offences. He acknowledged that the offence involving Mr S, was of a shorter duration than the other intimidation offences. As to the assault and larceny counts, Mr Moberley acknowledged that the assault was below mid-range but the larceny had a significant effect upon V - as it was intended to do - by depriving her of all her contacts.38. Mr Thangaraj acknowledged that the two offences involving the taser-like device were serious, although he submitted that the possession offence was effectively a backup charge. Mr Moberley acknowledged the force of that submission and that there should be a large degree of concurrency in the sentence, acknowledging however that the elements of each of the offences were different.39. Insofar as the demanding money with menaces offences, Mr Thangaraj acknowledged that custodial sentences were appropriate because of the amounts involved. He submitted that the effect upon the victim of the offences was not relevant.40. Mr Moberley on the other hand submitted that criminality was greater if a victim could not afford money which was demanded of them. He submitted that it made the offence quite serious objectively. I agree with Mr Moberley's submission that the offence is more serious because The offender knew that V could not afford to give him the money which he demanded.41. The assault occasioning actual bodily harm which was brought about by the application of the cigarette lighter to V was, Mr Thangaraj correctly acknowledged, clearly one which should attract custody. But he submitted that it was consistent with his client's psychological condition and a manifestation of his disorder.42. Mr Moberley submitted that that offence was above the middle of the range of objective seriousness for such offences as measured by the yardstick of the extent of the injuries.43. Mr Thangaraj, so far as the kidnapping and sexual assault were concerned, submitted as to the kidnapping that the advantage being sought was simply the continuation of the relationship and that I should take into account that the period that she was detained was not for a very long time and the offence was below the middle of the range.44. Mr Moberley, on the other hand, pointed out that the victim of the offence, V, was at the time making special efforts to avoid The offender and that the purpose of the detention was not as significant as Mr Thangaraj argued. He submitted that it was an offence within the middle of range of objective seriousness.45. Both counsel acknowledged, so far as the sexual assault was concerned, that the form of sexual intercourse, namely fellatio, was less serious than some other forms of sexual intercourse. Mr Thangaraj submitted that the offence was not within the middle of the range of objective seriousness. Mr Moberley argued that it was and pointed to the humiliation involved in the filming of some parts of the offence, or at least filming of the victim at a stage before the offence occurred. He said that it was within the middle of the range and should attract the standard non-parole period. 46. Both counsel acknowledged that there should be some degree of accumulation, as well as concurrency, in the various sentences which I will address in due course when I sentence the offender.47. As I have said, both counsel acknowledged that a sentence needs to be significant but not crushing. This is important for the reasons I said at the commencement of my remarks, so far as the rehabilitation is concerned, which The offender has already commenced and indeed was commencing at the time of the last offences on 22 September 2008. 48. It is important to point out that at that stage he had commenced seeing a therapist and the conversation that he had with V at that time acknowledged on his part that he was in need of a therapeutic assistance. He was sent to see a psychologist, Dr Mark Milic, who produced a report dated 2 March 2010. Dr Milic highlighted the emotional reliance which The offender had on V and diagnosed him as having a personality disorder with strong dependent and avoidant features.49. Dr Milic pointed out that research in the field of domestic violence reveals an emotionally volatile type of offender, driven by fear, dependence, anger, external blaming and jealousy. He said that the offender “most likely belongs to this group and his personality disorder is a significant source of his maladaptive relationship tendencies.” It is relevant for me to take into account that he had that diagnosis at the time that he committed these offences but it is far from being an excuse for the crimes which he committed mostly against V.50. He is, as I have said, still only twenty-six years of age. Mr Thangaraj pointed to his client's immaturity and naivety which I accept. The rehabilitation is progressing well, particularly since his counselling. And Mr Thangaraj pointed out that he had no treatment, until shortly before the day of the previous offences.51. He compared his client's point in life at that stage with somebody at the crossroads of life, an expression commonly used when sentencing drug offenders who have decided to undertake rehabilitation. The disorder he suffers from is regarded as treatable, Mr Thangaraj pointed out, and a tape recording which V made on the day of the last offences reflects, as Mr Thangaraj argues, where his client was so far as his condition on that day.52. Mr Thangaraj argues and Mr Moberley does not contradict or take issue with an assertion that there are special circumstances which would warrant me adjusting the relationship between a non-parole period and a balance of the term of sentences which would increase the time which he is on parole. Those special circumstances would include his client's age and the first time that he has been in custody and the rehabilitation which he needs to be undertake.53. I take into account evidence which I have heard from the offender's wife and from his sister, both of whom see him regularly in custody where he has been bail refused since being arrested on 25 September 2008. Both have been visiting him and both are supporting him to a significant extent. As I said both will continue to support him, so that his prospects of rehabilitation, in my opinion, increase by having with him a loving and supportive family.54. There is a sense in which the weight I need to put on specific deterrence is somewhat reduced by the fact that these offences were focussed on one particular relationship which is now in the past.55. I come now to impose the sentences which I have decided are appropriate. Many, or some, of the sentences may be regarded as somewhat lenient. I have done that because of the need to take into account the submissions - which I agree with - that without reducing some of the sentences the overall impact would be crushing on a young man who is still in his mid-twenties.56. I have determined that it is appropriate to impose custodial sentences in respect of all of the offences of which the offender has been convicted. I am going to sentence you now, [the offender], if you could stand up?57. For the intimidation, counts three, four and five, I sentence you in each case to three months imprisonment, being fixed terms. For count twenty-eight involving Mr S, I sentence you to a fixed term of one month imprisonment.58. Count three: the sentence will commence on 25 September 2008 and expires on 24 December 2008. Count four: three months commencing 25 October 2008 and expiring 24 January 2009. Count five: three months commencing 25 November 2008, expiring on 24 February 2009. Count twenty-eight: one month, commencing 25 February 2009 and expiring 24 March 2009. There is some concurrency and some accumulation, the overall result is a fixed term of six months for that group of four offences.59. Turning to counts sixteen and seventeen, the assault occasioning actual bodily harm and larceny. For the assault occasioning actual bodily harm, I sentence the offender to two months imprisonment, to commence on 25 February 2009 and to expire on 24 April 2009.60. For the larceny, I sentence the offender for count seventeen, to one month's imprisonment, to commence on 25 April 2009 and to expire on 24 May 2009. The effect of those two sentences, will be a cumulative total so far, of eight months imprisonment.61. Count thirteen is the more serious assault occasioning actual bodily harm. That is in my opinion, an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness and should attract a sentence of some two or three years imprisonment. However, I have determined to impose a sentence of seven months imprisonment for the reasons which I have already referred to. That seven months will commence on 25 February 2009 and expire on 24 September 2009. The overall effect is so far sentences amounting to twelve months imprisonment.62. I turn now to counts twenty-four and twenty-five, namely the offences involving the taser-like device. I regard the threat to use the taser-like device as a serious example of that crime which should normally warrant some four years imprisonment. But I propose to fix a sentence of three years imprisonment for count twenty-four, which will commence on 25 September 2008 and expire on 24 September 2011.63. Count twenty-five is an offence which carries a standard non-parole period of three years. I regard this, for the purposes, as being in the middle of the range of objective seriousness but I propose to fix a concurrent sentence. For count twenty-five, I sentence the offender to four years imprisonment. There will be a non-parole period of three years commencing 25 September 2008 and expiring 24 September 2011. The balance of the term will be one year to commence 25 September 2011 and expiring on 24 September 2012.64. Counts eleven and twelve are the demanding money with menaces counts. For each of those offences, I regard penalties of three years imprisonment as appropriate. For count eleven, I fix a penalty of three years imprisonment to commence on 25 December 2008 and to expire on 24 December 2011 and for count twelve, I fix a penalty of three years imprisonment to commence on 25 March 2009 and to expire on 24 March 2012. So far the cumulative total of sentences is custody for three and a-half years as a non-parole period.65. Turning to count twenty-three, the kidnapping offence, I regard a sentence of five years imprisonment as appropriate for that offence. There will be a non-parole period of four years, commencing 25 September 2008 and expiring on 24 September 2012. The balance of the term will be one year from 25 September 2012 and expiring on 24 September 2013.66. Finally for count twenty-six, the sexual intercourse without consent, I regard a sentence of nine years imprisonment as appropriate for that offence. There will be a non-parole period of five years, commencing 25 September 2008 and expiring on 24 September 2013. The balance of the term will be four years commencing 25 September 2013 and expiring on 24 September 2017.67. The overall effect of the sentence will be a nine-year sentence, with a non-parole period of five years. The non-parole period commences 25 September 2008, when the offender went into custody, and expires on 24 September 2013. The balance of the term of four years will commence on 25 September 2013 and expire on 24 September 2017.HIS HONOUR: All right now, two things, Mr Moberley and Mr Abbott. One will be the mathematics, which I think is right. And two, any factual errors or things which need revision in my sentencing? If there is anything which I have overlooked?ABBOTT: I think the maths are correct, your Honour.MOBERLEY: I think so, as well.HIS HONOUR: Any factual errors?MOBERLEY: Not from my part, your Honour.ABBOTT: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Okay.68. The offender, you have received a nine-year sentence. Nine years. It commenced on the day that you went into custody, when you were arrested, 25 September 2008 and your sentence expires nine years after that, on 24 September 2017.69. There is a non-parole period that you have to be in gaol and that is five years. I have fixed it at five years because you will turn thirty at about the time that that comes up. You will have turned thirty just before then and I have taken into account the things that I have said about your rehabilitation and the sentence not to be crushing. Your non-parole period expires on 24 September 2013, so you are in gaol until 24 September 2013.70. You then become eligible for parole. Whether you get parole or not, depends not on me but on the Parole Authority. They consider your case and grant you parole or otherwise. And then you are on parole for four years and you are still serving your sentence. And if you committed any crimes in that time, then you may have your parole revoked.HIS HONOUR: Tell me what you think, Mr Abbott and Mr Moberley, whether I should send with him, Dr Milic's report, into custody?ABBOTT: Yes, I think that's a good idea.MOBERLEY: I do as well, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Yes. Do you agree, Mr Moberley?MOBERLEY: I do.HIS HONOUR: I've got a fax number and I will fax it to the MRRC, to the reception room there. So that they will get it today. And that is where I expect The offender will be taken, MRRC?ABBOTT: Is it Parklea?HIS HONOUR: Does he have to go to reception at MRRC, now that he's a sentenced offender?SHERIFF'S OFFICER: Normally, he will be returned to his gaol until such time as - then we may move him to somewhere else.HIS HONOUR: All right. Perhaps we should send it with the warrant. I might arrange for my associate to photocopy this report, exhibit S1 and what should I do? Should I make it available to one of the - what do you suggest, Mr Abbott?ABBOTT: I think leave it with the warrant, because that would go with them back to the place he's going, Parklea.HIS HONOUR: Good. It will go with the paperwork and my associate will make that available. Mr Abbott, anything else that I need to do?ABBOTT: Yes.HIS HONOUR: For my sentence?ABBOTT: On the sentence, no, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Mr Moberley?MOBERLEY: No, your Honour.

     REGINA v JW 
     
     
      
      FACTS 
       
       
      The respondent entered pleas of guilty in the District Court to two charges under s 98 of the  
      Crimes Act  
      1900: one count of armed robbery causing wounding and one count of attempted armed robbery causing wounding. The respondent was aged 15 at the time of the offences. The robberies were carried out in the company of two co-offenders, then aged 15 and 14. Both robberies occurred at night in the vicinity of train stations. A knife was used on each occasion, with each victim suffering minor cuts to their hands. 
       
       
      The respondent was sentenced by North DCJ to imprisonment for 24 months for the first count, suspended under s 12 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 
       1999. The respondent was sentenced to 80 hours community service for the second count. Subjective factors taken into account included the age of the offender, his history of sexual abuse and domestic violence, and his continued good behaviour. The sentencing judge found that the respondent’s role in the joint criminal enterprise was not as serious as that of his co-offenders.  
       
       
      The Crown appealed to this Court. The issues on appeal were: 
       
       
        That the appeal was incompetent because the notice of appeal failed to identify grounds.  
       
       
        That the sentencing judge erroneously formed the view that a standard non-parole period (of seven years) applied to the sentencing of the respondent. (Ground 1) 
       
       
        That the sentencing judge treated as a matter in mitigation a matter which it was not open to him to find on the balance of probabilities, that is, that the respondent did not produce a knife. (Ground 2) 
       
       
        That the sentencing judge failed to have appropriate regard to the principles applicable to sentencing offenders for crimes committed as part of a joint criminal enterprise. (Ground 3) 
       
       
        That the sentencing judge had regard to irrelevant factors when determining the objective seriousness of the offence with the result that the sentencing exercise was unduly distorted. (Ground 7) 
       
       
        That the sentences imposed were manifestly inadequate. (Grounds 4, 5, 8 and 9)

      Competency of the appeal 
       
      Per Spigelman CJ, Allsop P, McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Johnson JJ agreeing 
       
       
      1 The Crown’s failure to identify grounds at the time of the filing of the notice of appeal did not render the notice invalid and the appeal incompetent. [31] [33] [205] [217]

      The double jeopardy issue 
       
      Per Spigelman CJ, Allsop P, McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Johnson JJ agreeing 
       
       
      2 The words “double jeopardy” in s 68A of the  
      Crimes (Appeal and 
        
      Review) Act 
       2001 refer to the distress and anxiety which a respondent suffers from being exposed to the risk of a more severe sentence. [54] [141] [205] [209]

      3 Section 68A prevents the Court of Criminal Appeal from exercising its discretion not to intervene on a Crown Appeal on the basis of the distress and anxiety to which all respondents to a Crown appeal are presumed to be subject. [92] [141] [205] [209]

      4 Section 68A does not remove the Court of Criminal Appeal’s residual discretion to reject a Crown appeal for reasons other than double jeopardy. [92] [95] [141] [205] [209] 
       
       
      5 Section 68A prevents the Court of Criminal Appeal on a Crown Appeal from reducing the sentence which it otherwise believes to be appropriate on the basis of such distress and anxiety [98] [141] [205] [209]

      7 A mistaken application of Div 1A of the  
      Sentencing Procedure Act 
       1999 by the sentencing judge, caused by an inaccurate Crown submission, is not an error which would lead to Court of Criminal Appeal to intervene on a Crown Appeal. [149]-[150] [205] [206] [212]

      8 With respect to the objective seriousness of the offence, there are limits to the amount of differentiation allowed amongst co-offenders in a joint-criminal enterprise. [166] [205] [213]

      9 A community service order for Count 2 manifestly fails to recognise the objective criminality of the offence and the respondent’s responsibility for the acts of his co-offenders in a joint criminal enterprise. Appeal upheld. [190] [205] [206] [214] 
       
       
      Per Spigelman CJ, Allsop P agreeing  
       
       
      10 The 2-year suspended sentence for Count 1, given the age, intellectual capacity, history of sexual abuse and domestic violence, and continued good behaviour of the respondent, was within the permissible range. [180] [183] [205]

      Per McClellan CJ at CL, Howie and Johnson JJ 
       
       
      11 The sentence on the first count is manifestly inadequate. The objective criminality of the offences (robbery in company on a public transport system at night) warrant severe punishment. The subjective factors relied on do not justify the sentences imposed or the suspension of the sentence for the first count. [206] [214]-[216]

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: The respondent entered pleas of guilty in the Sydney District Court to two charges under s 98 of the Crimes Act 1900: one count of armed robbery causing wounding and one count of attempted armed robbery causing wounding. 
     
      
    2 The maximum penalty for each offence was 25 years imprisonment. North DCJ sentenced the respondent on the first count to imprisonment for 24 months commencing on 21 August 2009. The sentence was suspended under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 on the condition the respondent enter a bond for the term of the sentence. On count 2 the respondent was sentenced to 80 hours of community service. 
     
      
    3 The respondent was aged 15 years and 10.5 months at the date of the offences. He was arrested with two co-offenders JC, also aged 15, and JM then aged 14. 
     
      
    4 The sentencing proceeding was based on an Agreed Statement of Facts. The respondent did not give evidence. Some additional evidence was tendered. 
     
      
       
      The Factual Findings 
       
      
    5 His Honour summarised the Agreed Statement of Facts as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The agreed facts are in evidence; I will give a short précis of them. At 10.35pm on 16 January 2008 the victim, Alan Sin, arrived at Allawah train station and walked along a path. The three co-offenders were sitting on a park bench. As the victim walked past the offenders, one of them kicked him in the back from behind and he fell to his knees. The first offender then put a knife to the victim’s throat, holding it in his right hand with the blade very close. The first offender said, ‘Give me all your money; where’s your money?’ The victim removed his wallet from his pocket and took all the cash totalling $100 which he handed to the first offender who placed it in a pocket. The first offender was described by the victim as an Islander approximately sixteen years of age wearing a white hooded jumper and a white baseball cap with a large rim. The offender said to the victim, ‘Is that all you’ve got?’ and then kneed him in the right side which unbalanced him. He supported himself on his left hand as a second offender came up and also put a knife to his throat with his left hand whilst holding him in a gridlock around the chest. This offender said, ‘Where’s your phone?’ The victim was unbalanced. He instinctively raised his hand to grab the blade when he felt it touch his throat, in doing so cutting three of his fingers. The third offender then said, ‘How much money did you give us?’ and the victim replied, ‘It’s a lot.’ The first male patted his pockets as another said, ‘’Where’s your phone?’ The third offender was given the phone and then threw it away saying, ‘Go fetch.’ All three offenders ran away to the station. 
        
       
       
        
        CCTV footage tracked the offenders’ movements to Rockdale Station. They left the station, turned left into the street after looking around and walking away. The victim of the first robbery was treated by a Dr O’Connor and his wound was cleaned and dressed with Steri-Strips and it did not require stitches. These facts relate to the first charge on the indictment. 
        
       
       
        
        The second offence: at around 11.10pm on the same evening the second victim, Mohammed Islam, alighted a train at Rockdale Station and rang his uncle. He asked his uncle to meet him at the station to walk him home. He walked into the street to meet his uncle. The second victim and his uncle then walked together along the street where they saw the three offenders this time sitting on a wall. They did not take much notice of them. After passing them the second victim, Mr Islam, felt that they were being followed and he has asked his uncle to check. They increased their walking pace and were nearly running. They ran towards their home and noticed the offenders were getting closer. The victim stopped at his house and opened the front gate to enter whilst his uncle ran up the side of the house. When the offenders reached the house the victim noticed they were all approximately fifteen to sixteen years of age. The first offender was wearing a black hooded jumper with the hood up over his head making it difficult to see him in the dim light. He stood outside with the other offender. The victim could not describe this offender. The third offender was skinny, had short brown hair and light skin. He was shorter than the victim, probably 160 centimetres tall, and wearing a white tee-shirt. He walked though the front gate and came up the stairs towards the victim. ‘What do you want?’ the victim said. The third offender replied, ‘I need money, give me money’. The victim said, ‘I will give you money, this is my house, I will give you money.’ The third offender then reached the top of the stairs and approached the victim who said he looked to be drunk and had glazed eyes. This offender reached into his pants and produced a flick-knife with a white handle and flicked it open. He said, ‘I want money.’ The blade was about twenty centimetres long. He held it in his right hand near his body rather than pointing it at the victim. The victim grabbed the knife with both hands saying, ‘I will give you money, I’m just going to call the police.’ One of the other offenders said, ‘Let’s go.’ The victim released the knife and he stepped away from the third offender. This offender ran away. As he did, the other two also left. In this offence the victim suffered a small wound to his left index finger and another to his right index finger with a slight right wrist strain. 
        
       
       
        
        Following the arrest of all three on 17 January 2008, a ten centimetre serrated knife was found on this offender. Whilst being placed in the police caged truck a further knife fell out of his right pants’ leg. This had a jagged blade and a light-reddish wooden handle. It was about twenty centimetres in length. Both knives were of the flick-knife variety.” 
        
       
      
    6 It will be necessary to refer to additional facts to deal with particular grounds of appeal.  
     
      
    7 An important aspect of the case concerned the subjective circumstances of the respondent. A number of expert reports were tendered on his behalf and his mother also gave evidence. North DCJ made findings of fact based on this evidence to which I will further refer below. His Honour also referred to the sentencing proceedings for the two co-offenders – JC and JM. 
     
      
    8 In addition to the Agreed Statement of Facts his Honour had before him a statement by the first victim. Furthermore, evidence was called from the co-offender JM. Some of this evidence, as will be seen, expanded upon, and was not consistent with, the contents of the Agreed Statement.  
     
      
    9 His Honour made the following specific findings: 
     
      
       
        
        “The agreed facts in this matter that I have to decide refer to the first, second and third offender, without nominating participants. The combined effect of exhibit 4, a statement of the first victim, and the evidence of JM is that on sentence I am left without any evidence of this offender actually producing or using a knife in either robbery. I recognise that on arrest he was found to be carrying two knives, an unnecessary abundance, one might think. However, it fits with all of the other subjective evidence that this offender may not be the brightest or the most entrepreneurial of the three young men. 
        
       
       
        
        If I had been left with just the agreed facts, then perhaps I could not have come to this decision regarding the production or use of a knife by this offender.” 
        
       
      
    10 His Honour went on to refer to the evidence of JM and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … in his evidence in the incident which he gave before me he did not put a knife in this offender’s grasp during the first incident. In the second incident, not only did he not put a knife in the grasp of this offender, but he agreed that because the offender at the time was overweight, weighing as much as 105 kilograms, in the chase up the street to the second victim’s house he lagged well behind. Indeed, the attempted armed robbery carried out by JC at that stage with the wounding may nearly have been completed by the time this offender arrived on the scene. That is slightly different to the agreed facts where the second victim says that he sees three people aged about fifteen or sixteen outside his house.” 
        
       
      
    11 With respect to both offences his Honour formed the opinion that the offender’s role was not as serious as either of his co-offenders. On the basis of the evidence before him, North DCJ indicated that he was driven to make findings of fact that were not the same as those made about the respondent’s conduct by the judge who sentenced the two co-offenders. 
     
      
    12 His Honour set out and made findings about the subjective circumstances of the offender to which I will further refer below. A report of a clinical psychologist, Mr Peter Champion, identified the risk factors in the respondent’s prognosis. His Honour took this Report into account when expressing his conclusions about the subjective circumstances of the offender, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Given the guarded prognosis of Mr Champion and the lack of any proper explanation for why a boy hitherto without any criminal antecedents should commit such objectively serious crimes it is difficult to assess his prospects of rehabilitation. These offences have clearly penetrated his consciousness and I am heartened by the fact that he has not only remained trouble free, but has acknowledged his remorse to Mr Champion and in the background reports. Eighteen months is a considerable period in any teenager’s life and I trust that he has learnt enough from this dreadful first experience with crime and the legal system to decide not to re-offend. As mentioned, both these crimes are objectively serious: innocent victims at night going about their everyday lives were accosted shortly after leaving a railway station; both were wounded, albeit fortunately not seriously. The offenders acted in company and they showed a disregard for public safety. There must have been some degree of planning in both offences, although it can hardly be described as sophisticated. They had knives, although there is no evidence that this possession was initially for the purpose of committing robberies.” 
        
       
      
    13 His Honour went on to state, on the basis of the submissions made to him by both the prosecution and the defence, that there was a standard non-parole period for this offence. His Honour made further findings as required by s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act based on this assumption. This assumption was not correct. Nevertheless, it explains why his Honour expressed some findings in this particular context.  
     
      
    14 His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I take into account that the offender was only fifteen at the time and due to his age and intellectual disabilities which I have canvassed he may not be fully aware of the consequences of his actions. I believe given his eighteen months of trouble-free behaviour since his arrest that he does have reasonable prospects of rehabilitation. Further, the midrange of seriousness covers a broad spectrum and I am of the view that neither offence falls within the midrange of objective seriousness of an aggravated offences of this type, and of this offender, taking into account the facts that I have found regarding his complicity an the subjective features, I assess it to fall well below that middle range. I would not have found this had the wounding been more deliberate and serious in each case. As stated, the standard non-parole period remains relevant to sentence: the law is quite clear that other than in exceptional circumstances a sentence of full-time imprisonment is warranted for offences of this kind. The offender is a child. Because these offences are so serious he is to be sentenced at law; that is, in accordance with adult penalties. The sentencing considerations relevant to children are to be taken into account as well as those that normally attend the sentencing procedure. Section 6 of the  
        Children (Criminal Proceedings) Act  
        1987 sets out the principles to be applied when sentencing children for all offences, including serious children’s indictable offences; see  
        The Queen v GDP  
        (1991) 53 ACR 112. How to apply these principles and the extent to which they should be applied is a matter for balance and judgment. With young people, rehabilitation assumes a greater importance than general deterrence and punishment. It is desirable that young people be allowed, if possible, to continue their education and employment and reside at home with family; see  
        The Queen v Smith  
        (1984) CrimLR 70. In  
        DB  
        (2007) 167 ACR 393, the CCA reaffirmed the principle that in sentencing juvenile offenders regard should be had to their immaturity and vulnerability and the importance of rehabilitation. This is an important aspect of this matter given the young age of the offender, his complete lack of criminal antecedents both before and after these charges and his undoubted disabilities. At the time of these offences, being fifteen, he was a long way from adulthood; all the evidence clearly demonstrates his lack of capacity to properly consider the consequences of his actions. This is a matter in which I find that general deterrence and punishment which usually follow such objectively serious crimes should be subordinated to rehabilitation. 
        
       
       
        
        Taking into account his young age, his immaturity, his good character, his remorse, his eighteen months of strict bail and moves towards rehabilitation, his intellectual and physical deficits, I am satisfied that together they constitute exceptional circumstances. Accordingly, except for what follows, I do not propose to impose a term of full-time imprisonment.” 
        
       
      
    15 Prior to imposing the sentence his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In relation to the first charge and taking into account the discount for the plea, I will impose a sentence of twenty-four months imprisonment. I intend to order that this sentence be wholly suspended. On the second charge, also a very serious offence, it is appropriate to impose a sentence that will allow his rehabilitation to continue and to be focused along the lines suggested in the background report by Juvenile Justice and Mr Champion. I will order the offender complete a community service order of eighty hours that will allow him to participate in both educational and counselling programs recommended by the Juvenile Justice system.” 
        
       
       
      Competency of the Appeal 
       
      
    16 The respondent submits that the appeal is incompetent on the basis that the notice of appeal failed to expressly state any ground relied upon in support of the appeal. The Crown contends that there is no requirement that the Director of Public Prosecutions set out grounds of appeal in the notice which initiates a Crown appeal. It submits that, for the purposes of apprising the Court and any party of the basis of the appeal, it is sufficient to identify grounds in written submissions. Alternatively, the Crown seeks the leave of the Court to file a document, attached to the Crown’s written submissions, amending the notice of appeal. 
     
      
    17 The respondent makes no complaint that it has received inadequate notice of the grounds of appeal as supplied in the form of written submissions. The complaint is that there has not been a valid notice of appeal and, accordingly, that the appeal is incompetent. 
     
      
    18 Appeals to this Court are a creature of statute. The issue falls to be determined in accordance with the law of statutory interpretation. Failure to comply with a statutory requirement does not necessarily render proceedings invalid. The issue remains one of statutory interpretation as to the effect of the relevant failure. (See Project Blue Sky Inc v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1998) 194 CLR 355 at [92].) 
     
      
    19 The provision invoked by the Crown is s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 which provides relevantly: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any sentence pronounced by the court of trial in any proceedings to which the Crown was a party …” 
        
       
      
    20 As can be seen, there is no reference to a ground of appeal in this section. This is in contrast with s 5 which confers a right of appeal on a convicted person in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “5(1) A person convicted on indictment may appeal under this Act to the court: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) against the person’s conviction on any ground which involves a question of law alone; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) with the leave of the court … against the person’s conviction on any ground of appeal which involves a question of fact alone, or question of mixed law and fact, or any other ground which appears to the court to be a sufficient ground of appeal; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) with the leave of the court against the sentence passed on the person’s conviction.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    21 Parliament made express provision in Pt 4 of the Criminal Appeal Act for procedural matters including, relevantly, the following section: 
     
      
       
        
        “10(1) The following provisions apply to an appeal, or application for leave to appeal, under this Act against the person’s conviction or sentence: 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (c) The appeal, or application for leave to appeal, is to be made in accordance with the rules of court, which may include: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) provision with respect to any statement of grounds of appeal, transcripts, exhibits or other documents or things to accompany the appeal or application; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          …” 
          
         
        
       
      
    22 The terms of s 10(1)(c)(i) strongly suggest, save where there is a reference to a “ground of appeal” as in s 5 of the Act, the absence of grounds in a notice of appeal will not, of itself, undermine the validity of the notice. That is, of course, subject to any rule actually made pursuant to s 10(1)(c). 
     
      
    23 The relevant rules are 23C and 23E of the Criminal Appeal Rules which relevantly provide: 
     
      
       
        
        “23C A notice of appeal against conviction, or a notice of application for leave to appeal against sentence, may not be filed, except with the leave of the Court or the Registrar, unless it is accompanied by the following:  
        
       
       
        
        (a) a statement of the grounds for appeal,  
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        23E(1) Notice of an appeal under section 5C, 5D, 5DA, 5DB or 5F (2) of the Act is to be sent to the Registrar by the appellant.  
        
       
       
        
        (2) The appellant is to serve a copy of the notice referred to in subrule (1) on the respondent as soon as practicable after sending the notice to the Registrar.” 
        
       
      
    24 As this Court has indicated on a previous occasion (Director of Public Prosecutions (NSW) v Lombard [2008] NSWCCA 110; (2008) 184 A Crim R 565 at [2]) r 23E of the Criminal Appeal Rules makes no reference to a notice of a Crown appeal containing grounds. This is in contrast to r 23C, with respect to, relevantly, an application for leave to appeal against sentence. To repeat, that rule expressly states that any such notice “may not be filed, except with the leave of the Court or the Registrar, unless it is accompanied by … a statement of the grounds for appeal”. 
     
      
    25 Rule 23C implements the express requirement of an appeal “on any ground” referred to in s 5(1)(a) and (b). Such a requirement is understandable in a statutory context where leave of the court is required, as in s 5(1)(b) and (c). An appeal under s 5D does not require leave. 
     
      
    26 The inference that an absence of grounds in a notice of a Crown appeal does not affect the validity of the appeal is reinforced by r 77 which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where provision as to any matter of procedure is not contained in these rules, the Court or a judge may direct what proceedings are to be taken.” 
        
       
      
    27 Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that the identification of the basis of a Crown appeal is of significance, not only on procedural fairness grounds for the respondent to such an appeal, but also in terms of informing the Court of the basis of the appeal. The notice of appeal should be regarded as a formal document which contains within itself the issues to be determined on the appeal. Precision in this respect may, for example, be of significance if the matter arises in another forum, for example, in the High Court on a special leave application or in a further application for leave to appeal if leave had once been refused.  
     
      
    28 In this criminal justice context it is important that there be a formal document identifying precisely what was before the Court of Criminal Appeal. It is the notice which forms the record of the court upon which the parties join issue. (See R v Halmi [2005] NSWCCA 2; (2005) 62 NSWLR 263 at [51].) 
     
      
    29 That issues of this character are not solely concerned with matters of procedural fairness was recently affirmed by the High Court in Kirk v Industrial Relations Commission (NSW) [2010] HCA 1 where the Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[26] The common law requires that a defendant is entitled to be told not only of the legal nature of the offence with which he or she is charged, but also of the particular act, matter or thing alleged as the foundation of the charge … In more recent times the rationale of that requirement has been seen as lying in  
        the necessity of informing the court of the identity of the offence with which it is required to deal 
         and in providing the accused with the substance of the charge which he or she is called upon to meet.” (Emphasis added.) 
        
       
      
    30 In my opinion, parallel reasoning applies to an appeal in criminal proceedings. A formal document identifying the grounds of that appeal ought to be brought into existence in any Crown appeal.  
     
      
    31 The criminal law context is such as to often support a conclusion that Parliament intended failure to comply with a procedural requirement as going to the validity of the proceedings. (See, eg, R v Birlut (1995) 39 NSWLR 1 at 5-6; R v Deng (1996) 136 FLR 201 at 205-206; R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 281; (2005) 64 NSWLR 10 at [90]-[91].) However, on the basis of my analysis of the statutory context above, Parliament did not intend that failure to identify grounds of appeal in the document initiating a Crown appeal under s 5D of the Act would render the appeal invalid.  
     
      
    32 This appears particularly by force of s 10(1)(c)(i), as confirmed by a comparison between r 23C and r 23E. Furthermore, the rules themselves make express provision for procedural defects of any character as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “76 Non-compliance by an appellant with these rules, or with any rule of practice, shall not, unless otherwise ordered by the Court or a judge, prevent the appeal being prosecuted, but the Court or a judge may make such amendments and give such directions as may be required.” 
        
       
      
    33 In my opinion, this rule applies in the circumstances of a notice of appeal of the kind originally filed in the present case. This Court should acknowledge as a desirable “rule of practice”, within the meaning of r 76, that a Crown appeal should identify grounds of appeal in the notice of appeal. However, that practice does not require such grounds to be identified when the notice is first filed. This is an issue of proper practice, not of the validity of the appeal. 
     
      
    34 Mr T Game SC, who appeared for the respondent, relied upon some observations in the High Court in Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; (2009) 83 ALJR 579. That was a case in which the notice of appeal identified the relevant ground as being that the sentence was “manifestly inadequate”. The Court noted at [8] that no allegation of a more specific character was contained in the notice and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “If a case of specific error of any of those kinds was to be made it would have been necessary to identify the asserted error in the grounds of appeal.” 
        
       
      
    35 I accept, of course, that the grounds of appeal have to be identified at some stage. The High Court’s observations do not imply that the failure to identify grounds at the time of the filing of the notice of appeal renders the notice invalid and the appeal incompetent. 
     
      
    36 Mr Game SC submitted that the Court should not grant leave to amend. He did not, however, submit that his client had been denied procedural fairness by reason of notice of the grounds of the appeal being given in the form of written submissions. His submission emphasised the significance of the identification of grounds of appeal. However, in the present case, those grounds were identified in advance of the oral hearing. In the absence of any suggestion that a procedural fairness issue arose, I can see no reason why the Court should not exercise its power under s 76 to permit the amendment. 
     
      
    37 I should indicate that, even if my analysis above was wrong and there was no valid notice of appeal, I would have given the appellant leave to file a notice of appeal containing the above grounds returnable instanter. Mr Game SC accepted that this was permissible and did not suggest that there would be any denial of procedural fairness in doing so. However, it is not necessary to take that course. 
     
      
    38 Leave should be granted to amend the notice of appeal by identifying the following grounds, as sought by the Crown: 
     
      
       
        
        “1 His Honour erroneously formed the view that a standard non-parole period (of seven years) applied to the sentencing of the respondent. 
        
       
       
        
        2 His Honour treated as a matter in mitigation a matter which it was not open to him to find on the balance of probabilities, that is, that the respondent did not produce a knife. 
        
       
       
        
        3 His Honour failed to have appropriate regard to the principles applicable to sentencing offenders for crimes committed as part of a joint criminal enterprise. 
        
       
       
        
        4 His Honour fashioned the sentence for Count 1 of 24 months imprisonment, to enable him to order that it be suspended. 
        
       
       
        
        5 His Honour erred in forming the view that there were, in the case of the respondent, ‘exceptional circumstances’ such that his sentence of imprisonment on Count 1 be suspended. 
        
       
       
        
        6 His Honour failed to impose a sentence in respect of Count 2 which reflected the objective seriousness of the offence. 
        
       
       
        
        7 His Honour erred by having regard to irrelevant factors when determining the objective seriousness of the offence with the result that the sentencing exercise was unduly distorted. 
        
       
       
        
        8 His Honour failed to impose a sentence which properly reflected the objective seriousness of Count 1. 
        
       
       
        
        9 Gave too much weight to subjective circumstances.” 
        
       
       
      Issues on the Appeal 
       
      
    39 This appeal raises an important issue for the administration of criminal justice, namely the interpretation of the statutory provision which abolished the doctrine of double jeopardy with respect to a Crown appeal against sentence. It is for that reason that the Court has been constituted as a bench of five. I will consider this issue first. 
     
      
    40 Constitutional issues were raised by the submissions originally filed by the Crown as to the proper interpretation of s 68A. In the event, by reason of submissions made on the part of the Attorney General, intervening in these proceedings in response to a notice issued under s 78B of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), and whose submissions were in large measure adopted by the Crown, it will not prove necessary to determine the constitutional questions. 
     
      
    41 The Crown’s written submissions identified each of Grounds 1 and 2 as “patent” errors, whereas Grounds 3 to 9 were said to be reasons why the sentencing judge “fell into error”. As I understand the distinction sought to be made in this submission, the two “patent” errors constituted, of themselves, errors of principle. I will consider each in turn. 
     
      
    42 As to the seven other grounds, as I understand the Crown’s submissions, each is said to constitute what is often referred to, by way of contrast with a “patent” error, as a “latent” error. The latter kind of error is not said to constitute an error of principle of itself. It is a term applied to an error within the last category in House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499, namely as the basis for an inference that the exercise of the sentencing discretion miscarried as reflected primarily in the alleged inadequacy of the sentence imposed. 
     
      
    43 Grounds 3 and 7 raise distinct issues, with which it is convenient to deal separately. It is appropriate to consider each of the other grounds in the context of the respective offences, ie, Grounds 4, 5, 8 and 9 with respect to the First Offence and Grounds 6 and 9 with respect to the Second Offence. 
     
      
       
      The Double Jeopardy Issue 
       
      
    44 A sentencing principle commonly referred to in terms of “double jeopardy” has always applied to Crown appeals. The Crown invokes s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, inserted by the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Amendment (Double Jeopardy) Act 2009.  
     
      
    45 That section provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “68A(1) An appeal court must not: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) dismiss a prosecution appeal against sentence, or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) impose a less severe sentence on any such appeal than the court would otherwise consider appropriate,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        because of any element of double jeopardy involved in the respondent being sentenced again. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) This section extends to an appeal under the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
         1912 and accordingly a reference in this section to an appeal court includes a reference to the Court of Criminal Appeal.” 
        
       
      
    46 Section 16 of Sch 1 to the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, inserted by the 2009 Amendment Act, provides that the new s 68A: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … extends to an appeal that was commenced but not finally determined before the insertion of the section.” 
        
       
      
    47 With respect to the scope of s 68A, the principal submission on the part of the Attorney was stated in writing as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … the words ‘any element of double jeopardy’ in s 68A refer to the principle that an appeal court may apply a discount in sentencing an offender because the offender is being sentenced twice. It is evident that this is the only element of double jeopardy addressed in s 68A.” 
        
       
      
    48 In the course of advancing this submission, reliance was placed on an Agreement in Principle Speech (a new name for a Second Reading Speech) made by the Parliamentary Secretary on the Amendment Bill in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly on 23 September 2009. This was in the same terms as the Second Reading Speech tabled in the New South Wales Legislative Council on 22 September 2009. In each case, the Parliamentary Secretary identified the practice under the double jeopardy principle to the effect that “the Court will … give an automatic discount because the offender is being sentenced a second time for the same offence”.  
     
      
    49 Mr J Griffiths SC, who appeared for the Attorney General, characterised the “discount” referred to by the Parliamentary Secretaries in written submissions as amended in oral argument, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “The discount was intended to reflect the distress and anxiety of facing sentence again irrespective of the circumstances of the particular offender.” 
        
       
      
    50 I note at this stage that, as the authorities to which I will shortly refer indicate, it is not appropriate to confine the double jeopardy principle to a “discount”. The double jeopardy principle was also deployed in significant degree to the exercise of the discretion not to intervene and resentence the applicant at all. Furthermore, an issue has arisen as to whether s 68A affects references in the case law to the “rarity” of Crown appeals. 
     
      
    51 Mr D Arnott SC, who appeared for the Crown, also submitted that s 68A “excludes only the distress and anxiety of facing sentence a second time”. The Crown, correctly in my opinion, distinguished between distress and anxiety of facing sentence for the first time, which is an inevitable concomitant in most cases of a conviction, and the additional distress and anxiety caused by the possibility of a harsher sentence on appeal.  
     
      
    52 The Crown accepted that the anxiety and distress of an offender facing a term of imprisonment may be relevant, by reason of the subjective circumstances of that particular offender. It submitted that s 68A was not directed to that consideration. I agree that such anxiety and distress may be relevant to resentencing. It is capable of being a significant indication that considerations of personal deterrence are not to be given significant weight. That appears to be the case on the facts of the matter before the Court. 
     
      
    53 The original Crown submission, which submitted that a wider range of matters relevant to the exercise of the sentencing discretion fell within the double jeopardy principle, was withdrawn. The matters withdrawn were: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … damage to reputation, legal costs, negative effects on third parties such as family members, completion of the sentence by the respondent or his or her imminent release from custody, delay by the Crown in lodging the appeal or in notifying the respondent of the appeal, errors by the Crown representative at sentencing that led the sentencing judge into error or acquiescence in the sentence by the Crown, and ‘tinkering’ with the sentence (that is, where there is only a small difference between the sentence at first instance and ‘what should have been’).” 
        
       
      
    54 The words “double jeopardy” are deployed in different senses. (Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 at [9]; Island Maritime Ltd v Filipowski [2006] HCA 30; (2006) 226 CLR 328 at [41].) When used in the context of sentencing, the principle of double jeopardy encompasses the element of distress and anxiety which a respondent suffers from being exposed to the possibility of a more severe sentence. The significance of such distress and anxiety is affirmed in the case law. 
     
      
    55 For example, in R v Hayes (1987) 29 A Crim R 452 at 469, Kirby P expressed the view that a Crown appeal against sentence was not strictly a form of double jeopardy but added: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … in a practical sense, there is a species of double jeopardy. The prisoner’s liberty, pocket and reputation are put in jeopardy both before the sentencing judge and before the appellate court … In addition, the prisoner suffers the anxiety and stress caused by the situation of uncertainty arising from the delay in resolving his or her position …” 
        
       
       
      (See also  
      Cooke v Purcell  
      (1988) 14 NSWLR 51 at 58.) 
       
      
    56 In the joint judgment of McHugh, Hayne and Callinan JJ in Pearce supra at [10], their Honours stated that “if there is a single rationale for the rule or rules that are described as the rule against double jeopardy, it is that described by Black J in Green v The United States”. 
     
      
    57 In Green v The United States 355 US 184 at 187-188 (1957) Black J said: 
     
      
       
        
        ""The underlying idea, one that is deeply ingrained in at least the Anglo-American system of jurisprudence, is that the State with all its resources and power should not be allowed to make repeated attempts to convict an individual for an alleged offense, thereby subjecting him to embarrassment, expense and ordeal and compelling him to live in a continuing state of anxiety and insecurity, as well as enhancing the possibility that even though innocent he may be found guilty."" 
        
       
      
    58 Although those observations were not made in the context of an appeal against sentence, they nevertheless clearly applied to such an appeal.  
     
      
    59 The passage from Green was referred to with approval in the majority opinion in United States v DiFrancesco 449 US 117 at 127-128 (1980), in a context of determining whether or not a statutory provision permitting an appeal by the executive against a sentence violated the Double Jeopardy Clause in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of the United States.  
     
      
    60 The Court majority opinion stated at 133 that there were “fundamental distinctions between a sentence and an acquittal”. The Court went on to say at 136: 
     
      
       
        
        “We have noted above the basic design of the double jeopardy provision, that is, as a bar against repeated attempts to convict, with a consequent subjection of the defendant to embarrassment, expense, anxiety and insecurity, and the possibility that he may be found guilty even though innocent. These considerations, however, have no significant application to the prosecution’s statutorily granted right to review a sentence. This limited appeal does not involve a retrial or approximate the ordeal of a trial on the basic issue of guilt or innocence … To be sure, the appeal may prolong the period of any anxiety that may exist, but it does so only for the finite period provided by the statute. … The defendant’s primary concern and anxiety obviously relate to the determination of innocence or guilt, and that already is behind him. The defendant is subject to no risk of being harassed and then convicted, although innocent.” 
        
       
      
    61 DiFrancesco was a five/four decision. The dissentients rejected the majority view that an appeal against sentence “exposes the defendant to minimal incremental embarrassment and anxiety” (149) and added “To the convicted defendant, the sentencing process is certainly as critical as the guilt-innocence phase. To pretend otherwise … is to ignore reality” (150). 
     
      
    62 Although there is no constitutional dimension in Australian law in this respect, the case law in this nation appears to be more in accord with the minority opinion in terms of an assessment of the level of anxiety and insecurity occasioned by a Crown appeal against sentence. Whether this was an accurate assessment of the psychology of offenders no longer needs to be considered. 
     
      
    63 It was a common ground in this Court that prior to exercising the discretion conferred by s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the Court must identify error on the part of the sentencing judge of the kind for which the most frequently cited authority is House v The King supra at 505. This principle was established in the very first case to come before this Court shortly after s 5D was introduced into the Criminal Appeal Act. (See R v King (1925) 25 SR (NSW) 218.) The extent of the discretion was stated to be more wide ranging by the High Court in Whittaker v The King (1928) 41 CLR 230. However, the principle that error had to be found in cases under s 5D was clearly established by the High Court in Griffiths v The Queen (1977) 137 CLR 293 and has been affirmed on numerous subsequent occasions including in a unanimous High Court judgment. (See Lowndes v The Queen [1999] HCA 29;  (1999) 195 CLR 665 at [15].) 
     
      
    64 Once an error of principle has been identified, the result is that an offender has not been sentenced in accordance with law. Prima facie, it is the duty of the Court of Criminal Appeal to resentence. There are, however, discretionary considerations which arise as the words “may in its discretion” in s 5D make clear. Section 68A removes some such considerations. The issue before the Court is to identify the scope of that section. As the “double jeopardy” principle was a creation of the Courts, the task of statutory interpretation can only be undertaken by reference to the course of judicial decision-making. The intention of Parliament when enacting s 68A was to remove a judicially created sentencing principle. 
     
      
       
      The Double Jeopardy Case Law 
       
      
    65 The judgment of Barwick CJ in Griffiths v The Queen introduced the idea of an additional element, over and above the application of the error principle, in the case of a Crown appeal. This consideration was not at first identified in terms of double jeopardy. Barwick CJ noted at 310 that, what the Court held in that case, to be a misinterpretation of the decision of the High Court in Whittaker supra, “Had led to much more frequent appeals by the Attorney-General than might properly have been expected”. 
     
      
    66 His Honour went on to state at 310: 
     
      
       
        
        “On my view of the proper meaning of s 5D in the context of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 
        , an appeal by the Attorney-General should be a rarity, brought only to establish some matter of principle and to afford an opportunity for the Court of Criminal Appeal to perform its proper function in this respect, namely, to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons.” 
        
       
      
    67 To similar effect were the observations of Murphy J when his Honour, referring to the function of a court of criminal appeal under s 5D, said at 331: 
     
      
       
        
        “Its discretion not to vary may be and should be used to minimise the increasing of primary sentences, and to discourage frequent Crown appeals, so that the appeals may be invoked only rarely as the extraordinary remedy that was intended, and that it was until recent years.” 
        
       
      
    68 Although the orders of the High Court in Griffiths were unanimous, the other three members of the High Court, Stephen, Jacobs and Aickin JJ, made no observations about the frequency of Crown appeals.  
     
      
    69 The observations of Sir Garfield Barwick in Griffiths reflect his general attitude to Crown appeals, which he had described in Peel v The Queen (1971) 125 CLR 447 at 452 in the following way: “They cut across time honoured concepts of criminal administration”. Peel involved the issue as to whether or not s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act was picked up by s 68(2) of the Judiciary Act (Cth) so that the Commonwealth Attorney-General had a right to appeal from an allegedly inadequate sentence in a Commonwealth criminal case. Barwick CJ found that s 68(2) should not be so interpreted. He was in dissent on this issue. 
     
      
    70 The approach of Barwick CJ to Crown appeals was reflected in subsequent High Court authority, eg, “represents a departure from traditional standards of what is proper in the administration of criminal justice”. (Malvaso v The Queen (1989) 168 CLR 227 at 234 per Deane and McHugh JJ. See also the reference to departure from “time honoured concepts” in the joint judgment of Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295 at 299.) 
     
      
    71 So far as I am aware, the first occasion on which the element of restraint in the case of a Crown appeal was identified in terms of the terminology of double jeopardy was in the influential joint judgment of the Federal Court of Australia on appeal from the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory in The Queen v Tait (1979) 46 FLR 386. The bench on this occasion included both Brennan J and Deane J, then members of the Federal Court, elevated to the High Court in 1981 and 1982 respectively.  
     
      
    72 After affirming the error principle, the joint judgment stated at 388: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … a Crown appeal raises considerations which are not present in an appeal by a defendant seeking a reduction in his sentence.” 
        
       
      
    73 Their Honours added at 388-389: 
     
      
       
        
        “A Crown appeal puts in jeopardy ‘the vested interest that a man has to the freedom which is his, subject to the sentence of a primary tribunal’ (per Isaacs J in  
        Whittaker v The King. 
        ) The freedom beyond the sentence imposed is, for the second time, in jeopardy on a Crown appeal against sentence. It was first in jeopardy before the sentence in court.” 
        
       
      
    74 Their Honours went on to identify certain examples of injustice that could arise in the context of what their Honours called “double jeopardy”: 
     
      
       
        “It would be unjust to a defendant to expose him to double jeopardy because of an error affecting his sentence, if the Crown’s presentation of the case either contributed to the error or led the defendant to refrain from dealing with some aspect of the case which might have rebutted the suggested error.” (at 389) 
       
       
        “It would be unjust to a defendant, whose freedom is in jeopardy for the second time, to consider on appeal the case made against him on a new basis – a basis which he might have successfully challenged had the case against him been fully presented before the sentencing court”. (at 389) 
       
       
        “ … there would be few cases where the appellate court would intervene on an appeal against sentence to correct an alleged error by increasing the sentence if the Crown had not done what was reasonably required to assist the sentencing judge to avoid the error, or if the defendant were unduly prejudiced in meeting for the first time on appeal the true case against him”. (at 390) 
       
      
    75 The first application of the terminology of double jeopardy after Tait, was in the judgment in R v Wilton (1981) 28 SASR 362; (1981) 4 A Crim R 5. This was a judgment of King CJ, one of the most respected criminal appeal judges of the time.  
     
      
    76 In Wilton, the Crown sought to raise on appeal a contention with respect to sentencing that was not put to the sentencing judge. The learned Chief Justice said at 367-368: 
     
      
       
        
        “The consequences of allowing the prosecution to do so are serious. The respondent has faced the prospect of deprivation of his liberty by way of imprisonment and has been spared, subject to observance of the conditions of the bond. If the prosecution is allowed to raise the contention he must again face the prospect of imprisonment. This is what the Federal Court meant in  
        R v Tait and Bartley  
        (1979) 24 ALR 473 
          
        by ‘double jeopardy’. In my opinion, this court should allow the prosecution to put to it, on an appeal against sentence, contentions which were not put to the sentencing judge, only in exceptional circumstances which appear to justify that course.” 
        
       
      
    77 Prior to Tait’s case, New South Wales case law on Crown appeals did not employ double jeopardy language. (See, eg, R v Cuthbert (1967) 86 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 272; R v Donaldson (1968) 87 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 501.) The first occasion of which I am aware on which the terminology of double jeopardy was adopted in this Court was in R v Tleige (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 19 November 1982, unreported).  
     
      
    78 In Tleige, Street CJ, with whom Lee and Lusher JJ agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In determining what the quantum of sentence should be we have, as not infrequently occurs in the case of Crown appeals, borne in mind that the respondent has been twice in jeopardy in the matter of sentence. It will be distressing in the extreme for him to suffer the sentence passed on him some time ago being increased. This leads us to determine a sentence which is more lenient than would properly be appropriate if the matter were coming forward for sentence for the first time.” 
        
       
      
    79 In a frequently cited judgment of this Court the terminology of “double jeopardy” was adopted in R v Holder & Johnston (1983) 3 NSWLR 245 where Street CJ said at 255-256: 
     
      
       
        
        “An important element in determination of a Crown appeal is the exercise of the residual discretion to dismiss an appeal notwithstanding that error of one or other of the categories mentioned above may have been established by the Crown. This discretion is a real and live discretion. In practice, it is exercised not infrequently. It enables the Court to keep an ultimate control by protecting a convicted person against unfairness or injustice if that would flow from an adverse appellate decision. It is in this ultimate discretionary field that considerations of what has been called double jeopardy are of particular relevance. Within this field, also, the court’s understandable reluctance to detect manifest inadequacy may be given, so to speak, a second opportunity of operating in the convicted person’s favour.” 
        
       
      
    80 I note that Street CJ does not identify “double jeopardy” as in any way exhausting what his Honour calls the “discretionary field”, being the “residual discretion to dismiss an appeal notwithstanding that error … may have been established by the Crown”. 
     
      
    81 Street CJ went on to refer to the second, discrete, aspect of the double jeopardy referable not to the discretion as to whether or not to intervene but in terms of the approach to determining the appropriate sentence once the decision to intervene has been taken.  
     
      
    82 His Honour said at 256: 
     
      
       
        
        “Not only does the Court of Criminal Appeal have a discretion to dismiss a Crown appeal albeit that manifest inadequacy is established, but also the sentence passed on a successful Crown appeal does not always represent the full measure of sentence which might have been passed upon the convicted person at first instance.” 
        
       
      
    83 There are numerous cases in this and other courts of criminal appeal in which the courts have stated that the fact that an accused on a Crown appeal is subject to “double jeopardy” is relevant both to the exercise of the discretion whether to intervene at all and also to the determination of what sentence should be imposed once the decision to intervene has been made. A third issue is whether references to the “rarity” of Crown appeals, flowing from the observations in Griffiths set out at par [67] above, also reflect the double jeopardy principle. I will deal with each of these three matters separately. 
     
      
    84 Some of the authorities from other states on the double jeopardy principle must be treated with care because the legislative regime in a number of States differs in significant respects from that applicable in New South Wales. For example, in some states there is a requirement that leave be granted before a Crown appeal against sentence can proceed. In New South Wales there is a clear distinction in the legislative scheme between the leave requirement for a sentence appeal under s 6 of the Criminal Appeal Act and the absence of any such requirement in s 5D of that Act. Accordingly, Crown appeals in a statutory context where leave is required, may give rise to a broader range of considerations than those to which it is appropriate to have regard where an appeal lies as a right.  
     
      
       
      The Discretion to Intervene 
       
      
    85 R v Holder & Johnston authoritatively established for this State that the Court retains a discretion to dismiss a Crown appeal to be exercised on the basis of “unfairness or injustice”. As this formulation itself indicates, the discretion is not one to be exercised on the basis of a narrow range of considerations. Numerous authorities affirm the existence of such a discretion. However, the principle of double jeopardy, now abolished by statute, is only one basis on which this discretion can be exercised albeit, perhaps, the most frequent basis upon which it has historically been exercised. 
     
      
    86 Subject to its scope of application, this aspect of double jeopardy was not controversial in this case. The Second Reading speeches by the Parliamentary Secretaries in each House said: 
     
      
       
        
        “Under the current common law principles that apply to Crown appeals against sentence, the appeal court has a wide discretion to refuse to intervene and adjust the sentence, even where an error has been shown. In considering whether to intervene, the court currently takes into account the fact that the person is facing ‘double jeopardy’ in the sense that they are re-sentenced for a second time.” 
        
       
      
    87 Counsel for the respondent contended that the discretion not to intervene remained extant on the basis of considerations not falling within the concept of double jeopardy. This submission should be accepted. 
     
      
    88 The courts of criminal jurisdiction, including courts of criminal appeal, have always been astute to exercise what can be described as a supervisory jurisdiction over the executive branch of government’s involvement in the administration of criminal justice, with respect both to police investigations and to criminal prosecutions. This approach has been manifest in a number of different ways including the exercise of the inherent jurisdiction to prevent abuse of process or the exercise of the discretion to reject otherwise admissible evidence. 
     
      
    89 A clear example is the power exercised to stay criminal proceedings on the basis that an abuse has occurred on the part of the police or of the prosecution. Historically, a particularly significant example was the formulation of the Judges’ Rules for the admissibility of criminal confessions. (See the outline of the history of the Rules at Practice Note (Judges’ Rules) (1964) 1 WLR 152, G Abrahams Police Questioning and the Judges Rules, (1964) Oyez Publications, esp at 12-19; The Honourable Justice F M Neasey “The Rights of the Accused and the Interests of the Community” (1969) 43 Australian Law Journal 482 at 493-495.) 
     
      
    90 The Judges’ Rules were a creation of the judiciary at the commencement of the twentieth century. The only relevant authority the judges had to exercise was the discretion to reject the tender of a confession into evidence. Rejection of such evidence would, in many cases, lead to an acquittal. The Rules were never applied as if they were binding. (See R v Voisin (1918) 1 KB 531 at 539-540; McDermott v The King (1948) 76 CLR 501 esp at 507; The Queen v Lee (1950) 82 CLR 133 at 154; Neasey supra at 486-493.) Nevertheless, the use of the Rules as non-binding guidelines recognised the institutional imperative of the police force to secure convictions. The English judges who adopted the Rules clearly understood that impeding the ability of the force to do so would constitute a powerful internal institutional discipline upon police conduct, of a character which may not have occurred by other means of regulation of such conduct, eg, disciplinary proceedings, which depend on action by other branches of the executive government.  
     
      
    91 Not dissimilar considerations arise with respect to ensuring proper conduct on the part of prosecutors and prosecutorial institutions. Notwithstanding the general principle that the prosecution does not have any interest in either a conviction or a particular sentence, it is nevertheless appropriate to recognise that an institutional imperative to ensure success in prosecutions does exist. There may be prosecutorial conduct which does not constitute an abuse of process, but nevertheless manifests an inappropriate approach to the conduct of a prosecution. 
     
      
    92 Accordingly, conduct by the Crown with respect to sentence hearings and Crown appeals may be taken into account in exercising the discretion as to whether to intervene at all. Such matters are not, in my opinion, limited to considerations of double jeopardy. The responsibility of the prosecutorial authorities for the fair, just and proper administration of the criminal justice system is such that many forms of inappropriate or unfair conduct can be taken into account in the exercise of the power and discretion vested in a Court.  
     
      
    93 In this regard, I would include such matters as the contribution the Crown made to sentencing error by the sentencing judge and an attempt to conduct an appeal on a different basis to that advanced below. Both of these matters were identified in the judgment of The Queen v Tait as manifestations of the double jeopardy principle (see at [74] above). I do not believe they are so restricted. Nor is the issue of delay in instituting a Crown appeal so restricted. As the Crown conceded in this Court, each of these three matters do involve double jeopardy considerations, but they involve additional considerations. It is only resort to the former which s 68A proscribes. 
     
      
    94 I am reinforced in this view by the situation in Queensland where the double jeopardy principle has not applied, because the statute providing for a Crown appeal states that the court has “an unfettered discretion” to vary the sentence. Even in such a context, the Queensland Court of Appeal has held that delay and the conduct of the prosecution of the sentence are factors which may lead the court to resentence at the lower end of the range. (See R v Lacey [2009] QCA 274 at [150].) 
     
      
    95 Accordingly, s 68A, whilst removing the double jeopardy element from the exercise of the discretion to intervene, leaves other aspects untouched. On this basis, there remains a residual discretion to reject a Crown appeal, notwithstanding the abolition of the double jeopardy principle. The Court of Criminal Appeal must continue to recognise in a real and practical way the Crown’s responsibility for the proper administration of the criminal justice system. 
     
      
       
      The Substituted Sentence 
       
      
    96 The second element of double jeopardy, being the constraint on the sentence the Court imposes if it decides to intervene, is well established. It has been expressed in a number of different formulations:  
     
      
       
        “towards the lower end of the range of available sentences” ( 
       Dinsdale v The Queen  
       [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [62] per Kirby J);  
       
       
        “the least sentence that could properly have been imposed” ( 
       R v Rose  
       NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 23 May 1996, unreported per Gleeson CJ, applied in  
       R v Jurisic  
       (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 232);  
       
       
        “one which is at the bottom of the range”( 
       R v Giam (No 2)  
       [1999] NSWCCA 378; (1999) 109 A Crim R 348 at [28] per Dunford J);  
       
       
        “usually requires a discount to be applied by this Court … the extent of that discount varies according to the individual circumstances subjective to the respondent” ( 
       R v Hallocoglu  
       (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 at 80 per Hunt CJ at CL);  
       
       
        “a sentence that is somewhat less than the sentence it considers should have been imposed at first instance” ( 
       R v Allpass  
       (1993) 72 A Crim R 561 at 562 per Gleeson CJ, Hunt CJ at CL and McInerney J);  
       
       
        “there is no tariff for the discount for the double jeopardy involved” ( 
       Comptroller-General of Customs v D’Aquino Bros Pty Ltd  
       (1996) 130 FLR 383 at 403; (1996) 85 A Crim R 517 at 538); 
       
       
        “generally less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court” and “generally … towards the lower end of the available range” ( 
       R v Wall  
       [2002] NSWCCA 42; (2002) 71 NSWLR 692 at [70] per Wood CJ at CL, with whom Meagher JA and Bell J agreed).  
       
      
    97 It is unnecessary to attempt to reconcile these different formulations. The basic principle was well established and, as the joint judgment of Gleeson CJ, Hunt CJ at CL and McInerney J in Allpass supra expressly stated at 562, the reduction in the sentence that the Court considered ought to have been imposed is an application of the double jeopardy principle.  
     
      
    98 This aspect of the concept of double jeopardy was not controversial in the submissions in this Court. It was clearly a sentencing principle applicable to each individual case in which the exercise of a discretion under s 5D arises. It has been removed by s 68A. The intention to do was made quite clear in the Second Reading speeches, where each Parliamentary Secretary said in each House: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … even where appeal courts have decided to intervene and impose a new sentence, under this principle they have historically imposed sentences that are less than that which they would otherwise have imposed, again on the basis that the prisoner is facing being sentenced for the second time. 
        
       
       
        
        The Double Jeopardy Law Reform Working Group, which reported to COAG, considered this issue. They gave weight to the argument that, where an appeal court finds that a sentence imposed at first instance is inadequate, but through the operation of sentencing principles (in particular the principle of ‘sentencing double jeopardy’) the inadequacy remains uncorrected, this does not serve the community’s interest in seeing crimes appropriately punished. 
        
       
       
        
        The Government agrees, and the provision in the bill make sure that where an offender has received too lenient a sentence because of an error made by the sentencing court, an appropriate sentence will be imposed on appeal, because the court will not be bound to give an ‘automatic discount’ because the offender is being sentenced a second time for the same offence.” 
        
       
       
      The Issue of “Rarity” 
       
      
    99 The third matter which arises in the present context is whether or not the observations of Barwick CJ in Griffiths supra, set out at [66] above, as to the “rarity” of Crown appeals are within the double jeopardy principle abolished by s 68A. The Crown submitted that references to “rarity” did not constitute a sentencing principle.  
     
      
    100 There appears to be no authority which indicates how the “rarity” proposition can be deployed as a sentencing principle applicable in an individual case. It is not clear how the Court would determine that, in some quantitative manner, over some period of time, the position has been reached that Crown appeals have become too frequent. Presumably, when that is determined to have occurred, the Court should act in some way with respect to the case before it. I have not identified any analysis of how that would be reflected in the decision in an individual case other than by the exercise of the discretion not to intervene in a decision or to impose a more lenient sentence than would otherwise be imposed. Both these matters are clearly within s 68A. 
     
      
    101 In the basal New South Wales authority on double jeopardy, R v Holder & Johnston, Street CJ did not reiterate the observations of Barwick CJ in Griffiths to the effect that Crown appeals should be “rare”. Rather he quoted from the judgment of Jacobs J in Griffiths at 327, who said with respect to s 5D: 
     
      
       
        
        “The trial judge is given a wide discretion from the circumstance that a Court on appeal will not likely conclude that another sentence should have been passed. The incorrectness of the sentence must be manifest … But if it does so conclude it must interfere in the case of a defendant’s appeal; it may in its discretion interfere in the case of an appeal under s 5D.” 
        
       
      
    102 There is no reference to any consideration of the frequency of Crown appeals. Jacobs J’s reasons, Street CJ said at 253, “stated the law in this regard as it has always been understood and applied in this Court”.  
     
      
    103 Street CJ added at 255: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … courts are understandably more ready to ascribe error where the ground is manifest excess than where the ground is manifest inadequacy. It would, however, be wrong for courts to adopt a posture of discouraging the bringing of Crown appeals whether by direct statements to this effect or by reluctance to entertain them fairly and properly. The legislature has specifically provided for a Crown appeal against sentence. It is the province of the Crown law authorities to determine whether in any given case to bring such an appeal. It is the duty of the court to decide it. If rights under a statute are used oppressively so as to amount in effect to a misuse, then it is both right and proper for a court to say so. But the mere fact that the Crown exercises its right to appeal falls far short of justifying expressions of judicial disapprobation.” 
        
       
      
    104 Subsequent to these remarks, the High Court reinforced the significance of Barwick CJ’s observations on “rarity”. At first, such references were made in cases from South Australia and Tasmania where the relevant statute contained a requirement of leave, unlike s 5D of the New South Wales Act. 
     
      
    105 However, in Malvaso v The Queen supra at 234, the joint judgment of Deane and McHugh JJ identified a Crown appeal against sentence as being “in a practical sense … contrary to the deep-rooted notions of fairness and decency which underlie the common law principle against double jeopardy”. Their Honours quoted the passage from Griffiths in which Barwick CJ referred to “rarity” and added at 234-235: 
     
      
       
        
        “In such a case, the court entrusted with the jurisdiction to grant or refuse such leave should give careful and distinct consideration to the question whether the Attorney-General has discharged the onus of persuading it that the circumstances are such as to bring the particular case within the rare category in which a grant of leave to the Attorney-General to appeal against sentence is justified.” 
        
       
       
      Their Honours stated at 234 that the observations of Barwick CJ in  
      Griffiths 
      : 
       
       
        
        “ … should be accepted as representing general and authoritative guidance to the Courts of Criminal Appeal of this country.” 
        
       
      
    106 This passage indicates that the observations so endorsed are to be applied as a sentencing principle. It is by no means clear that Barwick CJ intended that to be the case. His Honour had said Crown appeals “should be a rarity”. The word “should” is ambiguous. It can suggest either obligatory or advisable conduct. Nor is it clear that the admonition was directed to the judiciary. It is the executive which determines whether an appeal is instituted. 
     
      
    107 As Griffiths itself was an appeal from New South Wales, to which s 5D applied, there can be no doubt that in Malvaso their Honours intended to apply this proposition to s 5D, notwithstanding the absence of a leave requirement. 
     
      
    108 The reasoning in the joint judgment of Deane and McHugh JJ in Malvaso was adopted by the majority of the High Court in a joint judgment of Brennan, Deane, Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Everett v The Queen (1994) 181 CLR 295. Their Honours were again concerned with a statutory provision requiring leave. The joint judgment reiterated the double jeopardy basis for the approach to a Crown appeal when it said at 299: 
     
      
       
        
        “An appeal by the Crown against sentence has long been accepted in this country as cutting across the time-honoured concepts of criminal administration by putting in jeopardy for the second time the freedom beyond the sentence imposed.” 
        
       
      
    109 The joint judgment then expressly adopted the passage from Malvaso at 234-235, which I have quoted at [105] above, including the reference to “rare category”. The joint judgment also set out the extract from Barwick CJ in Griffiths. There is nothing in the reasoning in Everett to suggest that the adoption of the “rarity” references turned on the requirement of leave in the Tasmanian Act. 
     
      
    110 Written submissions for the respondent challenged the proposition that the references to “rarity” of Crown appeals was based on the double jeopardy principle. The submission referred to the sentence in Barwick CJ’s judgment set out at [66] above, which referred to the purpose of a Crown appeal being “to establish some matter of principle” and “to lay down principles”. These references are, in my opinion, a reference to the error principle. It can be readily accepted that the error principle does involve a significant restraint on the number of Crown appeals. However, in that respect, the frequency of appeals must be tied to the frequency of error. 
     
      
    111 In both the judgment of Deane and McHugh JJ in Malvaso and in the joint judgment in Everett, the reference in Barwick CJ’s judgment in Griffiths to establishing a “matter of principle” (ie the error principle) was expressly extended to encompass “manifest disparity or inconsistency in sentencing standards” (Malvaso supra at 234) or to “what is necessary to avoid … inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing standards.” (Everett at 300.) (See the authorities referred to by Wood CJ at CL in R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42; (2002) 71 NSWLR 692 at [70](c).) The clarification that manifest inadequacy or inconsistency involve correction on a matter of principle, will be of significance in terms of determining whether or not Crown appeals are, as a matter of fact, “rare”.  
     
      
    112 A useful synthesis of the principles established by the High Court is set out by Charles JA in R v Clarke (1996) 2 VR 520 at 522: 
     
      
       
        
        “Occasions may arise for the bringing of a Crown appeal (a) where a sentence reveals such manifest inadequacy or inconsistency in sentencing standards as constitute error in principle ( 
        Everett  
        at 300); (b) where it is necessary for a court of criminal appeal to lay down principles for the governance and guidance of courts having the duty of sentencing convicted persons ( 
        Griffiths  
        at 310); (c) to enable the courts to establish and maintain adequate standards of punishment for crime; (d) to enable idiosyncratic views of individual judges as to particular crimes or types of crimes to be correct; (e) to correct a sentence which is so disproportionate to the seriousness of the crime as to shock the public conscience (as to the last three, see  
        Osenkowski  
        at 213); (f) to ensure, so far as the subject matter permits, that there will be uniformity in sentencing ( 
        Everett  
        at 306).” 
        
       
      
    113 The frequency and significance of these matters can change over time. The criminal justice system has altered in critical and relevant ways over the 35 or so years since the judgment in Griffiths was handed down.  
     
      
    114 First, the size and nature of the judiciary has changed. The judiciary is considerably larger today and is a much more heterogeneous body in terms of gender, social origin and attitude than it once was. Issues of consistency arise more often in such circumstances. 
     
      
    115 Secondly, statutory intervention in the sentencing process has transformed the exercise of the discretion from the broad based, unguided discretion that existed at the time Griffiths was decided. Legislation has imposed detailed requirements, both of process and content, which considerably increase the complexity of the task and, accordingly, multiply the prospect of error and of inconsistency. The unguided, unfettered discretion which was the norm in 1976 has been transformed.  
     
      
    116 As a result, numerous Crown appeals now turn on alleged non-compliance with statutory requirements by sentencing judges. The experience of this Court with respect to the somewhat convoluted provisions of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, eg, as to the identification and treatment of the statutory list of aggravated and mitigating factors or the process of assessment and application of the system of standard non-parole periods with respect to most serious crimes, arise frequently in this Court in appeals by both the Crown and by offenders. The circumstances in which errors of principle are likely to be committed and manifestly inadequate sentences imposed have expanded. 
     
      
    117 These changes in the criminal justice system are such that one would expect an increase in the number of Crown appeals in this Court. I set out below how that increase has manifested itself over the last 20 years. In my opinion, the increase is not unreasonable in the circumstances I have identified.

    118 When the legislation introducing s 68A was enacted, the overall objective was expressed by each Parliamentary Secretary in the following manner: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … where an appeal court finds that a sentence imposed at first instance is inadequate, but through the operation of sentencing principle (in particular the principle of ‘sentencing double jeopardy’) the inadequacy remains uncorrected, this does not serve the community’s interest in seeing crimes punished appropriately.” 
        
       
      
    119 However, the Parliamentary Secretary in each House went on to state: 
     
      
       
        
        “Crown appeals on sentence are, and should continue to be, rare.” 
        
       
      
    120 In part, this could be understood to reflect an aspiration that sentencing error and manifestly inadequate sentences are not expected to occur often. However, primarily it should be treated as an indication about the approach to be taken on the part of the Director of Public Prosecutions in the exercise of his or her discretion to institute such appeals. In this respect it is a statement directed to the executive, not to the judiciary. Whatever the expectation or intention, the words cannot bind the Court when determining the scope of the “double jeopardy” principle which was, after all, created by the judiciary, not by Parliament.  
     
      
    121 There is a tension between the ‘rarity’ proposition and the reluctance of courts to interfere with a prosecutorial discretion. (See, eg, Barton v The Queen (1980) 147 CLR 75 at 94-95; R v Apostilides (1984) 154 CLR 563 at 571-575; Maxwell v The Queen (1996) 184 CLR 501 at 512-514, 534.) 
     
      
    122 In Maxwell, Dawson and McHugh JJ said at 512: 
     
      
       
        
        “Our courts do not purport to exercise control over the institution or continuance of criminal proceedings, save where it is necessary to do so to prevent an abuse of process or to ensure a fair trial.” 
        
       
      
    123 In the context of a Crown appeal against sentence, it is the double jeopardy principle that constitutes the element of unfairness or injustice that could be seen to be an equivalent justification for constraining the Crown’s discretion under s 5D. For the courts to go further could raise constitutional issues, because of the possibility of compromising the integrity of the judicial process by the perception of judicial involvement in prosecution decisions about steps in the criminal justice process. (See Maxwell supra at 534; Director of Public Prosecutions (SA) v B (1998) 194 CLR 566 at [21]; Island Maritime Ltd v Filipowski supra at [81].) 
     
      
    124 Insofar as references to “rarity” were to be understood as applicable to sentencing in an individual case then, in my opinion, those references should now be regarded as no longer applicable by reason of the abolition of the double jeopardy principle. There are a number of judicial observations which clearly link such references to the double jeopardy principle. I will set out only three. 
     
      
    125 Gleeson CJ, Hunt CJ at CL and McInerney J in Allpass supra at 562 referred to Barwick CJ’s observation about rarity and added: 
     
      
       
        
        “One reason for this is the element of double jeopardy that is involved in such appeals. Rules designed to safeguard against double jeopardy are deeply embedded in our system of criminal justice …” 
        
       
      
    126 Similarly, Kirby J said of the references to “rarity” in Dinsdale supra at [62]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The attitude of restraint reflected in such remarks has often been justified on the basis that a Crown appeal against sentence puts the prisoner in jeopardy of punishment for a second time …” 
        
       
      
    127 Finally, Maxwell P, who characterised the “rarity” principle as the “cardinal rule” in Director of Public Prosecutions (Vic) v Josefski [2005] VSCA 265; (2005) 13 VR 85 at [13], added: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is the common law’s abhorrence of double jeopardy which explains why a Crown appeal on sentence should only occur in the ‘rare and exceptional case’.” 
        
       
      
    128 I should refer to my own observations in R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85 at [19]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The authorities make it clear that Crown appeals should be rare. It may be that present practice does not reflect that restriction, nevertheless, successful Crown appeals should be rare.” 
        
       
       
      These observations were based on the double jeopardy principle. The reference to the “success” of appeals was a reference to the exercise of the discretion not to intervene. 
       
      
    129 Insofar as “rarity” was intended to apply as a sentencing principle by way of guidance to courts of criminal appeal, it should be understood as reflecting the double jeopardy principle, now abolished. Other reasons for the frequency or otherwise of such appeals are not matters that are generally of concern to a court of criminal appeal. They are directed to the prosecuting authorities. 
     
      
    130 There may be occasions when a pattern of Crown appeals can be seen to be operating in an oppressive manner. That may affect the exercise of the residual discretion based, as I have discussed above, on the obligation of the courts to ensure proper conduct on the part of persons involved in the criminal justice process. However, the focus of concern will be upon such conduct, rather than upon the effect on the individual accused of being subject to sentencing for the second time. It is this latter aspect which s 68A removes from consideration. 
     
      
       
      Interstate Case Law 
       
      
    131 The Crimes (Appeal and Review) Amendment (Double Jeopardy) Act which introduced s 68A in the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act implemented an agreement in principle, at the level of the Council of Australian Governments, to reform the law with respect to double jeopardy. This was consequent upon earlier amendments abrogating the principle of double jeopardy with respect to conviction appeals in limited circumstances. The agreement included amendment of the principle of double jeopardy with respect to sentencing.  
     
      
    132 A number of States have enacted this aspect of the agreement and, in general where such an agreement exists at a national level, it is desirable that the amendments, insofar as they constitute a uniform regime, should be interpreted in a uniform manner. However, in critical respects there is no uniform regime, because of the differences amongst the pre-existing provisions for Crown appeals. Nevertheless, it is pertinent to refer to interstate authority for guidance, whilst recognising the different legislative regimes that exist. 
     
      
    133 The only interstate provision which has received substantial interpretation is s 41(4)(b) of the Criminal Appeals Act 2004 (WA), which relevantly states: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appeal court deciding an appeal that does or may require it to impose a sentence, or to vary a sentence imposed, on a person for an offence (whether the appeal was commenced by the person or by the prosecutor) …  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) must not take into account the fact that the court’s decision may mean that the person is again sentenced for the offence.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    134 This concise language does not employ the terminology of “double jeopardy”. Accordingly, the case law is not directly applicable to s 68A. However, in the event, this provision has been interpreted to cover the same field.  
     
      
    135 In the first case, Western Australia v Wallam [2008] WASCA 117; (2008) 185 A Crim R 116, McClure JA, with whom Miller JA agreed, expressly indicated that this amendment was “intended to exclude the double jeopardy principle as a relevant consideration …” (at [29]). However Murray JA suggested that it had a more limited application. His Honour said that it excluded only the specific facts stated and that “… it leaves substantially unaffected the general principle by which the court will be guided in its approach to an appeal against sentence by the prosecution …” (at [121]).  
     
      
    136 In Western Australia v Cunningham [2008] WASCA 240; (2008) 190 A Crim R 430 Miller JA, with whom the other members of the Court agreed, referred to s 41(4)(b) as leading to the conclusion that “prosecution appeals are no longer subject to the ‘double jeopardy’ principle …” (at [21]). A similar conclusion was reached in Western Australia v Bennett [2009] WASCA 93. 
     
      
    137 The position in Western Australia was put beyond doubt in Western Australia v Atherton [2009] WASCA 148. Buss JA said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[149] In my opinion, s 41(4)(b) applies generally on the hearing of a State appeal against sentence. The provision does not merely abrogate the common law principle of moderation in relation to the new sentence to be imposed upon the appeal being allowed. It abrogates generally the common law principles applicable to State appeals against sentence.” 
        
       
      
    138 His Honour went on to refer to the previous cases of Wallam, Cunningham and Bennett and concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “[160] It is beyond argument that in  
        Cunningham  
        and  
        Bennett  
        this Court held unanimously that s 41(4), as amended, abrogated generally the common law principles applicable to State appeals against sentence.” 
        
       
      
    139 To similar effect were the observations of Miller JA at [382]-[385]. His Honour specifically rejected views expressed in that case by Pullen JA to the effect that “the common law principles relating to the frequency and proper role of prosecution appeals are not affected by s41(4) of the Criminal Appeal Act” (at [385]). This was a reference to the views expressed by Pullen JA with respect to the case law on “rarity”. 
     
      
    140 In a number of respects the Western Australian legislature regime differs, but there is nothing in the Western Australian case law which would suggest a different conclusion to that to which I have come with respect to the scope of s 68A. 
     
      
       
      Interpretation of s 68A 
       
      
    141 The following propositions emerge from the above analysis: 
     
      
       
      (i) The words “double jeopardy” in s 68A refer to the circumstance that an offender is, subject to the identification of error on the part of the sentencing judge, liable to be sentenced twice. 
       
       
      (ii) Section 68A removes from consideration on the part of the Court of Criminal Appeal the element of distress and anxiety to which all respondents to a Crown appeal are presumed to be subject. 
       
       
      (iii) Section 68A prevents the appellate court exercising its discretion not to intervene on the basis of such distress and anxiety. 
       
       
      (iv) Section 68A also prevents the appellate court from reducing the sentence which it otherwise believes to be appropriate on the basis of such distress and anxiety. 
       
       
      (v) Section 68A prevents the Court from having regard to the frequency of Crown appeals as a sentencing principle applicable to an individual case by taking either step referred to in (iii) or (iv), or otherwise. 
       
      
    142 It is necessary to deal with a particular Crown submission on the approach the Court should take to the exercise of its jurisdiction under s 5D after s 68A has removed double jeopardy considerations. The Crown submitted that, once error was identified, the Court was obliged to embark on the resentencing exercise. There were not, Mr Arnott submitted, two stages to the exercise: ie, whether to intervene and then to determine what sentence to impose, but only one question. That one question is: 
     
      
       
        
        “What is the correct sentence and is this significantly different to the one under appeal?” 
        
       
      
    143 The Crown went on to note that the Court could decide not to intervene if to do so amounts to “mere tinkering”. Mr Arnott emphasised, it was necessary for the Court of Criminal Appeal, having identified relevant error, to determine what sentence ought to have been imposed and then to assess whether or not there is a “marked difference” between that sentence and the sentence actually imposed and, if there was such a “difference”, the Court should proceed to resentence. 
     
      
    144 The obligation to compute and articulate the actual sentence which the appellate court would impose was said to flow from the reasoning of the High Court in McGarry v The Queen [2001] HCA 62; (2001) 207 CLR 121 as further explained by McHugh J in Strong v The Queen [2005] HCA 30; (2005) 224 CLR 1. 
     
      
    145 Both McGarry and Strong involved a sentencing regime in which there was more than one element in the sentence. These cases have no relevant analogy to a Crown appeal. The reference in McGarry at [9] to the appellate court being ‘obliged’ itself to resentence the offender, provides no support for the Crown’s contention. 
     
      
    146 As I have indicated above, there is a long line of authority which distinguishes, on a Crown appeal, between the discretion to intervene and the sentence to be imposed. That distinction remains after the enactment of s 68A. There are circumstances in which the discretion will be exercised without the appellate court determining what an appropriate sentence should be. Nothing in McGarry or Strong suggests the contrary. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
       
      
    147 The first ground of appeal is: 
     
      
       
        
        “His Honour erroneously formed the view that a standard non-parole period (of seven years) applied to the sentencing of the respondent.” 
        
       
      
    148 Both the Crown Prosecutor and the respondent’s counsel at first instance erroneously informed the sentencing judge that the standard non-parole period set under Div 1A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act applied to the respondent. However, by s 54B(3) of that Act, Div 1A did not apply to an offender under the age of 18 years. 
     
      
    149 This was an error instigated by the representative of the Crown and not corrected by the representative of the respondent. It is not an error which would lead this Court to intervene and resentence the applicant. The error can only have been unfavourable to the respondent and does not warrant the intervention of this Court on a Crown appeal. This result was left open in the case upon which the Crown applied, namely R v Amohanga & Rai [2005] NSWCCA 249; (2005) 155 A Crim R 202 at [118] and cf [116]. 
     
      
    150 For the reasons set out at above, this Court retains a discretion not to intervene in the case of a Crown appeal, notwithstanding the abolition of the double jeopardy principle. That discretion should be exercised in this case on the basis that the error was caused by the Crown submissions to the sentencing judge and that the error was not of a kind that could have caused the sentence to be lower than it would otherwise have been. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 
       
      
    151 The Crown asserts that it was not open to his Honour to conclude that the respondent did not produce a knife. This is a reference to the finding that his Honour made as set out at [9] above to the effect that, on the whole of the evidence before him, “I am left without any evidence of this offender actually producing or using a knife in either robbery”. As I have also set out, his Honour said that he may not have been able to draw this conclusion if he only had the Agreed Statement of Facts before him. His Honour said that in a context where the Crown had itself indicated, by calling JM, that it would not rely only on the Agreed Facts. 
     
      
    152 In oral submissions to this Court the Crown submitted that although his Honour was entitled to conclude that he could not decide whether JW had a knife or not, he was not entitled to conclude as a positive fact that he did not have a knife. 
     
      
    153 In written submissions the Crown characterised the matter it sought to raise under Ground 2 as a “patent” error. A finding of fact that was not open could be an error of principle, which entitles this Court to intervene. I approach this ground of appeal on the narrow basis so advanced by the Crown. I set aside any consideration of what weight is to be given to the identification of the particular person who wielded the knife in the context of a joint criminal enterprise. 
     
      
    154 In my opinion, the characterisation by the Crown of his Honour’s reasoning as being to the effect that it constituted a finding “as a positive fact that he didn’t have the knife” is not accurate. What his Honour said was that, by reason of the introduction of the oral evidence of JM which blurred the clarity of the evidence which appeared on the face of the Agreed Statement of Facts: 
     
      
       
        
        “I am left without any evidence of this offender actually producing or using a knife in either robbery.” 
        
       
      
    155 This is not, in my opinion, a finding of positive fact that he had no knife. It is appropriate to characterise it in the form that the Crown said was acceptable, ie, “That his Honour was entitled to conclude that he was unable to decide whether JW had a knife or not”. 
     
      
    156 Mr D Arnott submitted that the passage to which I have referred, which appeared at the top of a page of his Honour’s Remarks should be understood in the context of what his Honour went on to say at the bottom of that page and on the next page, being the passage which I have set out at [10] above. I am unable to accept that this passage constitutes a positive finding that the respondent had no knife. 
     
      
    157 Ground 2 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      Ground 3 
       
      
    158 Ground 3 is applicable to both offences. It alleges failure to apply sentencing principles applicable in the case of a joint criminal enterprise. It was not pressed as a separate error of principle, although in its terms it could be so regarded. Rather it was advanced as one of the “reasons” why “his Honour may have fallen into error”.  
     
      
    159 The Crown submissions did not identify with any specificity what aspect of his Honour’s reasons manifested the alleged error. The Court was not directed to any of the authorities on sentencing offenders for crimes committed as part of a joint criminal enterprise. No particular principle with respect to a sentencing for such cases was either identified or linked to any part of his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    160 With respect to Ground 3, the Crown invoked the observations of Carruthers AJ (with whom Beazley JA and Wood CJ at CL agreed) in R v Hoschke [2001] NSWCCA 317 as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[18] Insofar as the factual matters are concerned, it is, in my view, sufficient to notice the fact that criminal law has always looked with great disfavour upon robbery in company. If two persons agree to perform a joint criminal enterprise, such as in the instant case of robbery of an unarmed, innocent bystander, then it is inappropriate to attempt to assess with any degree of precision the role which each played in the consummation of the criminal enterprise.” 
        
       
      
    161 It may be the case that the particular role of a person engaged in a joint criminal enterprise does not always need to be identified with “precision”, because of the responsibility each participant in such a joint enterprise must bear for the acts of any other participant in carrying out that enterprise. Nevertheless, it is always relevant to refer to the particular conduct of each such participant with a view to identifying the level of culpability for which each must be sentenced. (See, eg, Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609; R v Howard (1992) 29 NSWLR 242 at 254-259; R v Spathis [2001] NSWCCA 476 at [193]-[197]. See generally A Dyer and H Donnelly, “Sentencing in Complicity Cases – Part 1: Joint Criminal Enterprise”, Sentencing Trends and Issues, No 38, Judicial Commission of New South Wales, June 2009.) I do not understand the brief observations in Hoschke to qualify this well established principle. 
     
      
    162 A more complete statement of the applicable principles is set out by James J, with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Adams J agreed, in R v Wright [2009] NSWCCA 3, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[28] If this conduct by other persons was done in the carrying out of a joint criminal enterprise to which the respondent was a party, then the respondent was to be sentenced for that conduct under the principle that a party to a joint criminal enterprise is to be sentenced for the full range of the criminal acts done by any of the parties to the joint criminal enterprise in the carrying out of the enterprise  
        R v Cotter & Ors 
         [2003] NSWCCA 273 especially per Carruthers AJ at 90.  
        
       
       
        
        [29] However, the respondent was not necessarily to receive the same punishment as would have been appropriate if he had himself personally performed all of those acts. In each case it depends on the circumstances whether a person who is criminally liable for an act as a principal in the second degree or as an accessory should be regarded as equally culpable, less culpable or even more culpable than the person who actually performed the criminal act. See the discussion by the High Court in  
        GAS v The Queen 
         (2004) 217 CLR 198 especially at 209 (23).  
        
       
       
        
        [30] A case to which the Court was referred on the present appeal was  
        R v Mitchell, R v Gallagher 
         [2007] NSWCCA 296. In  
        Mitchell 
         and  
        Gallagher 
         the two respondents to the Crown appeal against sentence had jointly attacked the victim, punching, kicking and stomping on him. It was found that Mitchell was the primary offender in the attacking of the victim, although Gallagher had also punched the victim to the head and kicked him as he lay on the ground. The Court of Criminal Appeal accepted that Gallagher’s objective criminality was less than Mitchell’s, even if not to a very substantial degree, and that, apart from differences in the subjective circumstances of the two offenders, Gallagher’s lesser objective criminality should be reflected in a lesser sentence.” 
        
       
      
    163 The Crown’s factual submissions on Ground 3 turned on his Honour’s observations that the respondent in this case “played a less prominent role than his two co-offenders” and that his “role was not as serious as either of his co-offenders”. It was not suggested that these particular observations by his Honour constituted an error of principle. However, it was submitted that it was not appropriate for his Honour to differentiate the sentence to be imposed on the respondent to “any marked degree” from that of his co-offender JC.  
     
      
    164 His Honour was clearly aware of the fact that the crimes were committed as part of a joint criminal enterprise. In the passage I have set out at [12] above his Honour said, to repeat: 
     
      
       
        
        “The offenders acted in company and they showed a disregard for public safety. There must have been some degree of planning in both of offences, although it can hardly be described as sophisticated. They had knives, although there is no evidence that this possession was initially for the purposes of committing robberies.” 
        
       
      
    165 The Crown’s submissions did not identify any specific respect in which his Honour’s differentiation of the comparative roles of the respondent and his co-offenders was impermissible in accordance with the principles identified in the passage in Wright set out above. As his Honour explained, he made findings of fact quite different from those made by the sentencing judge who sentenced the co-offenders. In particular, in terms of personality, maturity and actual conduct on the evening, the evidence before North DCJ was such as to permit an inference that the respondent was less dominant than his co-offender JC. 
     
      
    166 Whilst recognising that some differentiation in culpability amongst co-offenders in a joint enterprise is often appropriate, there are limits to which this can occur with respect to the objective seriousness of the offence, because of the existence of the common purpose to commit the offence. Differences in subjective circumstances will, however, result in differences, sometimes significant differences, in the end result.  
     
      
    167 The Crown has not established that his Honour’s exercise of his discretion erred on the basis identified in Ground 3. 
     
      
       
      Ground 7 
       
      
    168 Ground 7 is also applicable to both offences. The Crown submitted that his Honour erred in taking into account good character and lack of criminal record in the course of assessing the objective seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    169 The Court was informed that this ground was based on the following remarks by his Honour: 
     
      
       
        
        “In making a determination about the objective seriousness of the two offences, and having regard to s 21A of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act,  
        I take into account that the offender at the time was of good character and had no criminal record.” 
        
       
       
      His Honour went on immediately after this sentence to make the remarks that I have set out at par [14] above.  
       
      
    170 In this passage of his Remarks on Sentence, his Honour does not clearly distinguish between elements going to the objective seriousness of each offence and the subjective circumstances of the offender. His Honour ought to have done so. However, his Honour’s reference to s 21A indicates that the passage in the Remarks objected to was not in fact directed, notwithstanding its natural and ordinary meaning, to the objective seriousness of the offence.  
     
      
    171 Section 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act identifies as mitigating factors the absence of a record and the good character of the offender. (See s 21A(3)(e) and (f).) These were precisely the matters to which his Honour said he had regard, as he was obliged to do by s 21A(1)(b). The fact that his Honour additionally referred to these matters in the language of objective seriousness was a slip but not one which, in my opinion, had any material bearing on the sentences he imposed. 
     
      
    172 Ground 7 should be rejected. 
     
      
       
      The First Offence 
       
      
    173 Grounds 4, 5, 8 and 9 relate to the first offence. Collectively they are directed to establishing the proposition that the exercise of the discretion miscarried on the basis of an inference from each, or some combination, of these grounds.  
     
      
    174 Although no separate ground of appeal asserts that the result was that the sentence was manifestly inadequate, that is clearly the thrust of the grounds of appeal and of the submissions made. The Crown’s primary submission is that the sentence of two years for the offence was inadequate of itself. (Grounds 8 and 9.) Furthermore, it submits the sentence ought not to have been suspended, even if the sentence of two years was within the range. (Grounds 4 and 5.) 
     
      
    175 Grounds 8 and 9 which refer to an alleged failure to recognise the objective seriousness of the offence and the giving of too much weight to the subjective circumstances of the offender are two sides of the same coin, in the sense that one or other explain why his Honour imposed the sentence that he did.  
     
      
    176 The fact that it was common ground before his Honour that a standard non-parole period applied (see my discussion of Ground 1 above), is also relevant to one of the other matters about which the Crown complains in this respect. In the absence of a standard non-parole period it would have been necessary for his Honour to have regard to the guideline judgment of this Court in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. The fact that his Honour did not do so was, in the circumstances, not inappropriate, as the Crown conceded. First, he was not asked to do so. Secondly, that guideline has, in relevant respects, been superseded by the standard non-parole period. (C/f R v Tobar [2004] NSWCCA 391; (2004) 150 A Crim R 104 at [55].) However, as this alleged error was caused by the Crown, this Court should not intervene on the basis of his Honour’s failure to have regard to the guideline judgment unless it is satisfied that the sentences, or either of them, were manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    177 The facts constituting the first offence are of a considerable degree of gravity. The use of the knife with threats made, the presence of three offenders and the actual infliction of injury are such as would suggest that a sentence of two years would manifestly fail to reflect the objective gravity of the offence save in the circumstance of an exceptionally strong subjective case. The ultimate objective is the protection of the community and that would, in a case of this character and notwithstanding the youth of the respondent, require the principle of general deterrence to be given substantial weight. Nevertheless, there are circumstances in which the protection of the community is best served by exercising a degree of mercy where it appears that the prospect of a particular offender re-offending may be aggravated rather than diminished by requiring the offender to serve a custodial sentence. 
     
      
    178 It is clear that his Honour did give substantial and, in critical respects, determinative weight to the subjective circumstances of the respondent. However, in my opinion, his Honour was, in the particular circumstances of this case, entitled to do so. Specifically in his remarks on sentence his Honour identified the following: 
     
      
       
        As a child the respondent was exposed to domestic violence and sexual abuse. 
       
       
        He has learning difficulties and a low IQ and has been assessed in the bottom 14 percentile of the population. 
       
       
        Since his arrest some eight months before sentence he had been on strict bail, including a curfew that kept him at home each evening, and he has not breached bail or re-offended. 
       
       
        His physique changed since the CCTV photos taken at the time of the crimes, specifically, he has lost some 30 kilograms. 
       
      
    179 His Honour made the findings set out in the passage that I have set out at [12] above and applied the principles he identified in the passage set out at [14] above. 
     
      
    180 These findings were open to his Honour and, in my opinion, were such as to make it open to his Honour to reach the conclusion that, notwithstanding the gravity of the offence, a sentence of two years imprisonment was permissible. This sentence was, on his Honour’s findings, within the range, albeit at the bottom of the range. This was a case in which the frequently quoted observations of King CJ in R v Osenkowski (1982) 30 SASR 212 at 212-213; (1982) 5 A Crim R 394 at 394 could legitimately be applied. 
     
      
    181 As to Ground 4 the Crown’s submission is to the effect that his Honour fashioned the sentence so that it could be suspended, because the Court cannot suspend a sentence of greater than two years. However, nothing appears on the face of the reasons which could justify that criticism of his Honour. It is an inference only available if the two year sentence is itself manifestly inadequate. For the reasons set out above, that is not, in my opinion, the case. 
     
      
    182 With respect to his Honour’s decision to suspend the sentence, the Crown submitted that his Honour erred in holding that the facts identified in the last paragraph set out at [14] above were such as to constitute “exceptional circumstances” for the purpose of suspending the sentence. This was a reference to a line of authority which states that in the case of an armed robbery a non-custodial sentence will not be imposed unless there are “exceptional circumstances”. However, the approach in Osenkowsi to which I have referred, on the basis of the findings to which I have applied that approach, was such that his Honour could conclude that the circumstances were sufficiently exceptional to justify suspending the sentence. (C/f R v Govinden [1999] NSWCCA 118; (1999) 106 A Crim R 314 at [35]; Gadsden v R [2005] NSWCCA 453 at [36].) 
     
      
    183 In the circumstances identified by his Honour, particularly the subjective circumstances to which I have referred, his Honour’s decision to suspend the sentence was not outside the range of the proper exercise of his discretion. I refer particularly to the evidence before his Honour as to the manner in which the respondent had behaved for a period of some 17 months on bail, and the level of his anxiety about the threat of incarceration. It was open to conclude that a suspended sentence would serve the purposes of personal deterrence in the circumstances of this case.  
     
      
    184 It was also open to his Honour to conclude, on the evidence, that the respondent’s prospects of rehabilitation were good and would not be assisted by a custodial sentence. 
     
      
    185 As Howie J, with whom Hodgson JA and Levine J agreed, observed in R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [32]: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … although the purpose of punishment is the protection of the community, that purpose can be achieved in an appropriate case by a sentence designed to assist in the rehabilitation of the offender at the expense of deterrence, retribution and denunciation. In such a case a suspended sentence may be particularly effective and appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    186 In the case of the offence presently under consideration general deterrence is of significance. (See, eg, R v Taylor [2000] NSWCCA 442 at [49].) Nevertheless, in the particular circumstances of this case that consideration did not require an actual period in custody. 
     
      
    187 Each of the grounds of appeal with respect to the first offence should, in my opinion, be rejected. 
     
      
       
      The Second Offence 
       
      
    188 With respect to the second offence, his Honour imposed a Community Service Order of 80 hours. His Honour was obliged to impose a distinct sentence with respect to the particular offence in accordance with Pearce v The Queen (1998) 194 CLR 610.  
     
      
    189 For the reasons I have already discussed above, Grounds 3 and 7, insofar as each was relied upon with respect to the second offence are not made out. Grounds 6 and 9 are, as I have indicated above, mirror images of each other in the sense that his Honour’s alleged failure to reflect the objective seriousness of the offence was, in large measure, determined by the weight that he gave to subjective circumstances.  
     
      
    190 In my opinion, the Community Service Order which his Honour made was not within the range of the permissible exercise of discretion in this case. The offence was a serious one, even on the basis of his Honour’s finding that, by reason of his inability to run fast, the respondent arrived at the crime scene after some of the acts of the joint criminal enterprise had been carried into effect. This fact was not sufficient to substantially decrease the seriousness of the offending conduct in circumstances where, by reason of the commission of the first offence, the respondent was clearly aware of the probability that a knife would be used. Furthermore, he participated actively in the chase in circumstances where the victim knew that, irrespective of who was the first of the co-offenders to catch him, the others were close behind.  
     
      
    191 In my opinion, the sentence imposed manifestly fails to recognise the respondent’s responsibility for the acts of his co-offenders done in performance of the joint criminal enterprise. I would uphold grounds 6 and 9.  
     
      
    192 The Court had additional evidence before it for the purpose of resentencing. Generally, this evidence updated the evidence that was before the sentencing judge. The respondent himself gave evidence of the change in his lifestyle referring particularly to the fact that he no longer associated with his co-offenders. His mother gave evidence as to the stress and anxiety manifested by the respondent, which indicates that the objective of personal deterrence is already being served. 
     
      
    193 The psychologist, Mr Peter Champion, who gave evidence before the sentencing judge, provided an updated report. As I have noted in the passage set out at par [12] above, his Honour referred to Mr Champion’s “guarded prognosis” in the report before him. In the new report Mr Champion repeats his earlier “guarded” prognosis, but added: 
     
      
       
        
        “ … his compliance and lack of offending since being charged are I think positive signs, and give some basis for increased optimism in terms of him avoiding offending.” 
        
       
      
    194 Mr Champion went on to contrast his earlier assessment with what appeared to him on this latter occasion and said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I thought him somewhat more calm and co-operative on this occasion, more measured in his responses, whilst still at time dogmatic and oppositional. This may in part reflect a measure of maturation, but also I suspect reflects the emotional impact of the events of this year. His attempts to complete Year 10 and then find and maintain employment have been positive signs, though it would seem that his personal limitations in concert with his level of tension and preoccupation with the legal proceedings has tended to undermine his ability to see these endeavours through to a successful conclusion.” 
        
       
      
    195 Furthermore, Mr Champion added: 
     
      
       
        
        “His prognosis continues to be guarded simply because of the personal history and his limitations, though his compliance with bail conditions and the like for some 22 months, the lack of offending during that time and the fact that he was able to work for a period of time, do I think give some grounds to optimism in terms of re-offending, though I suspect that he will continue to struggle with various aspects of his personal life for some time to come.” 
        
       
      
    196 The report from the New South Wales Department of Juvenile Justice which was before North DCJ was dated 7 February 2009. The Court sought an updated report if, as has come to pass, it were to allow the appeal in any respect and proceed to resentence. In general terms the new report of 28 January 2010, affirmed the thrust of the earlier report. However, the update was significant in two respects.  
     
      
    197 First, the new report indicated that the respondent’s relationship with his immediate family had improved. Secondly, it affirmed that the respondent had severed ties with the group with which he had been associating at the time of the offences. He had cut his ties with his co-offenders and was spending more time with his family. 
     
      
    198 Furthermore, the new report notes: 
     
      
       
        
        “While the offences which JW were charged with appear to have some degree of peer influence, JW accepts responsibility for his actions.” 
        
       
      
    199 The Court was informed that, upon the Crown filing notice of this appeal, the Community Service Order sentence, together with the supervision by the Department of Juvenile Justice, was suspended. This occurred on 7 October 2009. The Court questioned the basis for this action. In the new report from the Department of Juvenile Justice it is acknowledged that this was an error. Accordingly, on 24 December 2009 the respondent’s community service and Juvenile Justice supervision resumed. The Court was informed that up to the date of the new report on 28 January 2010, the respondent’s response to the supervision had been satisfactory. He had up to that date completed 25 out of the 80 Community Service hours originally imposed. No doubt he has completed more, perhaps substantially all, of the original order. 
     
      
    200 There is some differentiation between the conduct of the offender in the first and second offences, even on his Honour’s generous findings of fact in favour of the respondent. However, the differentiation in the respondent’s culpability for the two offences is at best marginal. The injury inflicted on the victim of the first offence was more severe and there was no actual robbery on the second occasion. Accordingly, the charge was for attempt. Nevertheless, the degree of violence and aggression was of a similar order of magnitude.  
     
      
    201 It is, in my opinion, appropriate to impose the same sentence as was imposed for the first offence, namely imprisonment for two years which would be suspended subject to conditions. Although the first offence was somewhat more objectively serious, it is not appropriate to compare the two sentences. In my opinion, the first sentence was, as I have indicated, at the bottom of the permissible range. The new sentence for the second offence is, in my opinion, the correct sentence to be imposed at this time, in view of the additional subjective material before the Court and taking into account that he has already served at least a significant part of the sentence originally imposed. 
     
      
    202 The practical effect will be that the respondent will be at risk of imprisonment, if he should re-offend, for an additional seven months. Although this is, in my opinion, still a lenient result because of the seriousness of the offence, in all of the circumstances of this case it is an appropriate outcome. 
     
      
    203 The respondent has been under the supervision of Juvenile Justice. He has now turned 18 but the Court understands that it is not necessary for his supervision to be assumed by the Probation and Parole Service. That is fortunate as continuity is clearly important. 
     
      
    204 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1 Leave granted to amend the notice of appeal by adding the grounds set out in par [38] hereof. 
       
       
      2 Quash the sentence on Count 2 imposed by North DCJ on 21 August 2009. 
       
       
      3 On Count 2, the respondent is sentenced to a term of imprisonment of two years commencing on 22 March 2010 and concluding on 21 March 2012. 
       
       
      4 The sentence in Order 3 is suspended, pursuant to s 12 of the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
      upon the respondent entering into a bond for two years  
       
       
        
         
          to be of good behaviour during the period of the bond  
         
        
       
       
        
         
          to place himself under the supervision of the New South Wales Department of Juvenile Justice and obey any reasonable conditions imposed upon him by the Department, including conditions as to education or employment 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          to appear before the Supreme Court of New South Wales if called upon to do so at any time 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          to advise the Registrar of the Criminal Listing Directorate of any change of residential address 
         
        
       
      
    205 ALLSOP P: I agree with the reasons of the Chief Justice and with the orders proposed by his Honour. 
     
      
    206 McCLELLAN CJ at CL, HOWIE and JOHNSON JJ: We have received the benefit of reading the draft judgment of the Chief Justice. We agree with the orders he proposes but not with the whole of his Honour’s reasons. The difference between his judgment and ours is only in the different assessments of the adequacy of the sentence imposed for the first offence. In our opinion both sentences were manifestly inadequate. There was, in our view, no basis upon the facts or the personal circumstances of the respondent that a sentence other than full-time custody could be justified. They were unjust so far as the community is concerned. In particular they failed adequately to denounce the respondent’s conduct or to deter other young men from like behaviour. 
     
      
    207 It is important to bear in mind that the offences were committed by a group of young men on persons using the public transport system at night. There is no doubt that in the first offence the group were waiting for a likely candidate to rob as he made his way through a secluded park from the station. The group then went to another station and again selected a likely victim and chased him to his home. But even there he was not safe. Crimes of violence committed in those circumstances warranted severe punishment notwithstanding the age of members of the group or the other sentencing principles that apply to the sentencing of young offenders. Persons who are required to use public transport at night should be considered as vulnerable and protected by the sentences imposed in the courts. 
     
      
    208 In R v Kelly [2005] NSWCCA 280; 155 A Crim R 499, a case concerning an offence of violence committed at a railway station at night, Johnson J wrote: 
     
      
       
        
         
        6 In  
        R v Ranse 
         (Court of Criminal Appeal, 8 August 1994, BC9402928), Gleeson CJ said at page 8:  
         
          
           
          “One of the primary purposes of the system of criminal justice is to keep the peace. In this connection the idea of peace embraces the freedom of ordinary citizens to walk the streets and to go about their daily affairs without fear of physical violence. It also embraces respect for the property of others.” 
          
         
         
        This statement has been adopted recently by this Court with respect to the protection of citizens who use public transport late in the evening, thereby placing themselves in a position of some vulnerability:  
        R Ibrahimi  
        [2005] NSWCCA 153 at paragraphs 22-24.  
         
        
       
      
    209 We agree with the final outcome of the appeal only after considerable hesitation. Of course the sentence now proposed could not have been possible at first instance. In effect it results in cumulative suspended sentences. But because the respondent can avoid serving a custodial sentence by complying with the terms of the bonds imposed both by this Court and by the sentencing judge, such a result would have been manifestly inadequate had it been imposed at first instance. However, as the Chief Justice has identified, this Court retains the discretion in relation to its response to a Crown appeal by the words in s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912. We agree with all the Chief Justice has written about the effect of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. 
     
      
    210 In our opinion the sentence that the Chief Justice proposes can only be justified in light of the events that have occurred since the original sentences were imposed. In particular the period of 7 months that has transpired since North DCJ sentenced the respondent is a considerable period of time in the life of a juvenile who was aged 15 years at the time of the offences. In the meantime he has been carrying out his Community Service once it was brought to the attention of those responsible for its supervision that it should not have been suspended as a result of the Crown bringing an appeal to this Court. He had at the time of the writing of the most recent Juvenile Justice report, which is dated 28 January of this year, completed 25 hours of Community Service. We presume he has completed more hours since then. The latest report shows that the respondent has been complying with his supervision and attempting to address issues in his life. The report indicates that the respondent would “benefit from continuing to develop greater insight into this offence and strategies to reduce the likelihood of re-offending in the future”. He should now be given that opportunity by the Court exercising its discretion and imposing a lesser sentence than was warranted at first instance. 
     
      
    211 It is unnecessary that we set out the facts of the offences or the subjective circumstances relating to the respondent again, as we gratefully adopt what the Chief Justice has written in that regard. Nor do we wish to address all the grounds of appeal. It is enough that we have concluded that, for whatever reason, the sentences fell outside the proper exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. But we do believe that some of the grounds have merit. 
     
      
    212 The first ground refers to the fact that the Judge was misinformed about the application of a standard non-parole period. We find difficulty with the Crown relying upon such an error when it was partly responsible for the Judge’s mistake. But the fact that his Honour could impose the sentences he did under a belief that a standard non-parole period of 7 years applied, indicates how far he underestimated the seriousness of the offending and the extent to which he was overborne by the subjective case of the respondent. Had the standard non-parole period applied, we would not be agreeing to the outcome proposed by the Chief Justice. 
     
      
    213 With respect, we agree with what the Chief Justice has written about sentencing offences committed by offenders acting under a joint criminal enterprise. But in assigning roles to the specific participants, the sentencing judge should not lose sight of the fact that they were all participants in the crime. Here both crimes were robbery with wounding. Regardless of who had the knife that was used upon the victims or regardless of whether the offender might not actually have been at the scene when the second offence occurred, he was a participant in two armed robberies. By his plea of guilty to the offences he contemplated, not only that knives would be used, but also the possibility that the victims might be wounded in those offences being carried out. There was no suggestion that his co-offenders overbore the respondent in any way or that his culpability in being a participant in such serious offences was diminished. In those circumstances the fact that the offender might not have been more culpable than one of the other participants was of limited significance. In our opinion that finding could not justify the imposition of a sentence other than one of full-time custody. 
     
      
    214 We do not agree that the subjective factors recounted by the Chief Justice and relied upon by the sentencing judge could justify the sentences imposed for either offence even when they are taken together with the findings of fact in relation to the commission of the offences. It has been established that for armed robbery offences it would only be in exceptional circumstances that other than a sentence of actual custody could be imposed. We do not believe that the subjective factors in this case could have led to the imposition of the sentences imposed even had the charges been armed robbery or robbery in company. But the charges here were armed robbery with wounding and they were serious examples of their kind. In our opinion it would be very rare indeed that subjective factors could result in such exceptional circumstances that a custodial sentence could be avoided for an active participant in an offence of this nature. Yet here there were two offences. 
     
      
    215 But the subjective factors in this case were not of the quality that could in our opinion justify either the sentence imposed or the suspension of that sentence on the first count. The fact that the respondent had learning difficulties and a low IQ seems to us to have little relevance having regard to the nature of the offences committed. His Honour even went so far as to suggest that the respondent “may not have been fully aware of the consequences of his actions”. There was not, in our opinion, the slightest basis for that view. We do not understand how the respondent’s limited intellect or learning difficulties would impede his understanding that he was engaged in two separate planned attacks upon a person making his way home from a train station. As we have indicated, the pleas of guilty indicated that he contemplated that, as a result of the attacks, the victims may be wounded. His Honour’s statement is indicative of the over-emphasis he placed upon the respondent’s subjective case. 
     
      
    216 The fact that the respondent had not re-offended was of little significance seeing that he was on bail. The conditions of that bail were hardly onerous considering his age. He had to report to the police three times a week, he was not to approach certain persons or associate with his co-offenders, he was under a curfew between 7.00pm and 7.00am, later changed to 9.00pm and 6.00am and he was at other times to be in the company of a parent or an adult nominated by a parent. The respondent was fortunate to be granted bail so serious were the offences and such was the likelihood that he would have to serve a custodial sentence. No doubt bail was granted on the basis that he was pleading not guilty to the offences yet, as shown by his very late pleas of guilty, he was in truth a participant in both offences. 
     
      
    217 We agree with what the Chief Justice has written about the Director’s failure to specify grounds in the Notice of Appeal.

     Judgment 
      
      
     addendum 
     
     
      
    218 THE COURT: Since judgment in this appeal was published, it has come to the attention of the Court that the third order made erroneously fixed a date for the commencement of the sentence that was then suspended by the fourth order. Section 12(3) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Act”) provides that, with one exception not here relevant, Part 4 of that Act does not apply where a sentence is being suspended. That Part includes s 47 of the Act that refers to the commencement of sentences. Therefore, a court when suspending a sentence should not specify a commencement date of the sentence. Such a date will be determined if and when a court revokes the bond under s 99(1)(c) of the Act, in which case, by reason of s 99(c)(ii), Part 4 of the Act operates. 
     
      
    219 Accordingly this Court has determined to re-open the proceedings pursuant to s 43 of the Act to correct the error, as the sentence imposed is not in accordance with the law. The parties were given the opportunity of being heard on the application and did not object to this course. 
     
      
    220 We note that Judge North made the same mistake when suspending the sentence in respect of the first count by dating the suspended sentence from the date he made the order. This is an error that can, and should, also be addressed by his Honour under s 43 of the Act. 
     
      
    221 Accordingly order 3, as set out in paragraph 204 of the judgment, is amended by deleting the words “commencing on 22 March 2010 and concluding on 21 March 2012”. The other orders made remain unchanged.

      2007/16340 R v MELEHAN 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: The accused Tamie Melehan was charged with the murder of David Vaughan on 25 December 2008 at Gosford, New South Wales. On 22 March 2010, the trial proceeded before me as a judge sitting alone without a jury, the accused having made an election for such a trial under s 132(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, an election which was consented to by the Crown. The accused entered a plea of not guilty.  
     
      
    2 Section 133(1) of the Criminal Procedure Act provides that a judge trying a criminal proceeding without a jury may make any finding that could have been made by a jury on the question of guilt. A judgment by a judge in such cases must include the principles of law applied by the judge and the findings of fact upon which the judge relies (s 133(2)). If any act or law requires a warning to be given to a jury, the judge is to take the warning into account in dealing with the matter (s 133(3)). 
     
      
    3 There was no issue under the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 as to the accused’s fitness to be tried for the offence with which she had been charged. The accused is presumed innocent. She gave no evidence, but no adverse inference flows from that election. While the question of whether the accused had stabbed Mr Vaughan, causing his death, was initially in issue, after an adjournment it was announced at the hearing that the accused did not dispute that she was responsible for the act which caused Mr Vaughan’s death. The accused pleaded not guilty to the murder of Mr Vaughan, relying upon the defence of mental illness. This defence was based on the evidence that at the time she caused Mr Vaughan’s death, the accused was suffering from a mental illness, paranoid schizophrenia. 
     
      
    4 It follows that if I am satisfied that the Crown has proven the elements constituting the offence of murder, I am required to consider the defence of mental illness which the accused has raised. 
     
      
       
      What occurred on 25 December 2008 
       
      
    5 The facts were not in dispute. Mr Vaughan and the accused had been in a casual relationship since October 2008. They resided separately at Gosford. Mr Vaughan had twice been seriously injured in accidents. The first when he was 19, when he had suffered burns to some 90% of his body and had lost a part of his left arm, when he was electrocuted at a substation at The Rocks. He then underwent some 30 operations, while hospitalised for over 5 months. The second accident occurred in 2003 when Mr Vaughan crashed his car. He spent some 3 weeks in a coma and suffered brain damage, loss of balance, impaired speech, hearing, and vision, as well as short term memory loss. Again he was hospitalised for many months.  
     
      
    6 On 24 December 2008, Mr Vaughan spent the day with his family and on Christmas Eve, with a friend. His father picked him up at 8.15 am on Christmas day and later that morning Mr Vaughan caught a train to Gosford, planning to spend the day with the accused. 
     
      
    7 Mr Vaughan arrived at the home of the accused’s mother, Loretta Watts, between 9.30 am and 10 am, where he met the accused. The accused’s mother drove the accused and Mr Vaughan to the accused’s home, dropping them there between 10.30 am and 11 am. 
     
      
    8 Between that time and 2 pm Mr Vaughan was attacked. He was discovered by Ms Watts naked in the shower at the accused’s home at about that time. She went there in response to a phone call from the accused, who was present when she arrived. Mr Vaughan was later found to have sustained some 16 stab wounds to the neck, some of which were rapidly fatal, penetrating the jugular veins on both sides and the left carotid artery, as well as 6 stab wounds to the chest, and 4 to the abdomen, including 2 which were inflicted post death. He also suffered a number of defensive wounds to his right forearm. The wounds were caused by a sharp cutting weapon with a thin blade. A number of knives were found at the accused’s home. 
     
      
    9 The accused sent a number of text messages to Robert Bowcott between 1.07 pm and 1.22 pm that day. The accused and Mr Bowcott had formerly had a relationship which had ended prior to the accused and Mr Vaughan forming their relationship, but the accused and Mr Bowcott had maintained contact. Mr Bowcott’s statement as to the text message exchange was: 
     
      
       
        
        '20. At 1.02.37 pm, I received the message ""I got a kettle stereo jewlry perfume another stuff"". 
         
         
        21. At 1.07.11 pm, I received the message ""Miss u meet up tomorrow oh u work till what time oi can I eat this fella I think he taste good."" 
         
         
        22. At 1.17.27 I sent a text message to Tammie's number ""Eat who"" 
         
         
        23. At 1.17.33 pm I received the message, ""Can I eat him christas lunch an dinner"". 
         
         
        24. At 1.19.14pm I received the message, ""Theres enough go round if u want to join in no joke delicate meat."" 
         
         
        25. At 1.21.31pm I received the message, ""So can i eat him."" 
         
         
        26. At 1.22.51 pm I received the message, ""Dave who else dare me need help to get rid of body."" ' 
        
       
       
      
    10 At 1.53 pm the accused telephoned Mr Bowcott and said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ""I've Killed Dave. I'm about to chop him up. Come over and eat him."" 
         
        
       
      
    11 Mr Bowcott could not speak to her, he was at Christmas lunch. He described the accused as a quiet, friendly person, who became a different person when unwell. On one occasion she had attacked him with a knife. On this occasion he thought the accused must have been delusional, given how she was speaking. 
     
      
    12 At 1.55 pm the accused telephoned her mother telling her that 'Were(sic) fighting, can you come & get him before I slit his throat.' Ms Watts went to the accused’s home. The accused had sought her help in the past, when she could not cope with people. She found the accused in the lounge room and Mr Vaughan lying in the shower area, naked, flat on his back. The taps were off, there was blood and she thought that he had hit his head. She yelled ‘Tami(sic) what’s happened’, rang 000 and put the phone on loud speaker. The 000 record was in evidence. She attempted CPR. Her statement indicated that as she tilted his head back, she realised that Mr Vaughan’s throat was cut open. He was cold to touch.  
     
      
    13 Police and ambulance attended shortly afterwards. Mr Vaughan was found to have died before their arrival. When asked by a police officer what happened the accused said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        14.  
        I said 
        , ""What happened here today Tami? 
         
         
          
        She said 
        , ""I came home, I went inside and started sorting things out. I poured a glass of wine. Then I needed to go to the toilet but sat on the lounge. I made something to eat and was sitting on the lounge when I saw Dave's smokes and wallet on the table.""  
         
         
          
        I said 
        , ""Did you go to the toilet?"" 
         
         
          
        She said 
        , ""No, I made something to eat."" 
         
         
          
        I said 
        , ""What type of wine did you have?"" 
         
         
          
        She said 
        , ""Chardonnay."" 
         
         
          
        I said 
        , ""Was the front door open when you got home?"" 
         
         
          
        She said 
        , ""It was closed but unlocked."" 
         
         
          
        I said 
        , ""Does David have keys to your unit?"" 
         
         
          
        She said 
        , ""Yes."" 
         
         
          
        I said 
        , ""Then what happened?"" 
         
         
          
        She said 
        , ""Can I have my phone? 
         
         
          
        I said 
        , ""Why?  
         
         
          
        She said 
        , ""To call Rob and tell him you're here."" 
         
         
          
        I said 
        , ""No we can't go in. Who is Rob? 
         
          
        She said 
        , ""My boyfriend."" 
         
         
          
        I said 
        , ""I thought Dave was your boyfriend."" 
         
         
          
        She said, 
         ""Yeah they both are."" 
         
         
          
        I said 
        , ""Where does Rob live? 
         
         
          
        She said 
        , ""Umm not sure, I rang mum and Rob but didn't think to call you guys."" 
         
         
          
          I said 
          , ""Where is your phone?"" 
           
           
          She said 
          , ""On the table."" 
           
           
          I said 
          , ""What does it look like?"" 
           
           
          She said 
          , ""It's red."" 
           
           
          I said 
          , ""When did you leave your house?"" 
           
           
          She said 
          , ""Yesterday."" 
           
           
          I said 
          , ""What time?"" 
           
           
          She said 
          , ""I dunno."" 
           
           
          I said 
          , ""Was it in the morning or was it dark?"" 
           
           
          She said 
          , ""I dunno."" 
           
           
          I said 
          , ""Was it before lunch or dinner."" 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          She said 
          , ""After lunch but before dinner."" 
           
          
         
        15.  
        I said 
        , ""When were you ment(sic) to see Dave?"" 
         
          
           
          She said 
          , ""Tonight at 7pm."" 
           
           
          I said 
          , ""Where were you going too(sic) met(sic)?"" 
           
           
          She said 
          , ""He was coming here."" 
           
           
          I said 
          , ""How long had you been home when you found Dave?"" 
           
           
          She said 
          , ""About thirty or forty minutes."" 
           
          
         
        16.  
        I said 
        , ""What else did you do today?"" 
         
          
           
          She said 
          , ""I wanted to go to the toilet and have a cold shower and I went in and found him. I ran out and rang mum and text Rob."" There was silence and after a short period of time 
           
           
          She said 
          , ""I need to clean the kitchen."" 
           
           
          I said 
          , ""Why?"" 
           
           
          She said 
          , ""There is heaps of washing up, I need to wash up.""  
          
         
        
       
      
    14 The accused was placed under arrest. On legal advice she declined to be interviewed. 
     
      
       
      The accused’s mental state 
       
      
    15 The accused has a long history of mental illness. At the time of Mr Vaughan’s murder she was being treated for paranoid schizophrenia. This included fortnightly injections of long acting anti psychotic drugs administered by a nurse, as well as daily medication. She had received the last injection on 24 December at her mother’s home. There was also evidence that on 25 December she had consumed alcohol and had taken illegal drugs. 
     
      
    16 The accused was examined by psychiatrists retained by both parties, Dr Westmore for the Crown and Dr Nielssen for the accused. They were both of the view that given the nature of her mental illness, that the consequence of that illness was that the accused did not know that what she was doing was wrong. 
     
      
    17 Neither Dr Westmore nor Dr Nielssen expressed the view that the consumption of alcohol or drugs on 25 December 2008 was of any relevance to the opinions which they had formed. Their opinions rested on a consideration of the accused’s extensive medical record and their examinations of her. The evidence of those who attended the accused’s home on 25 December did not suggest that she was much affected by any drugs or alcohol, but that an appreciation of what she had done to Mr Vaughan was absent. 
     
      
    18 Dr Nielssen noted in a report of 12 June 2009 that the accused’s medical record showed her first admission with psychotic symptoms in February 2002, when she made a partial response to treatment. There was a history of childhood trauma, sexual abuse at age 12 and near drowning at the hands of an uncle at age 15. She was diagnosed with a schizophrenic illness and in 2003 there was an involuntary admission for treatment. In 2006 a doctor’s report prepared in relation to an assault charge noted ongoing treatment since age 19, with over 20 admissions to hospital in 7 years, with poor response to treatment and substance abuse. There were accounts of auditory hallucination and delusional beliefs. There had been several hospital admissions after suicide attempts by overuse of medication and treatment for depression. The report noted that the accused ‘is always aggressive and intimidating’ and that ‘she should be seen exclusively by a forensic psychiatrist since her potential for harming somebody in the near future is very high’. In 2007 the accused presented with auditory hallucinations and was reported to have said ‘I want to mass murder... but I know it is wrong’. 
     
      
    19 Dr Nielssen’s diagnosis was a severe form of treatment resistant schizophrenia and substance abuse disorder. His opinion was that the result of the accused’s mental illness was ‘frightening delusional beliefs arising from auditory hallucinations’ and that she ‘was unable to explain the connection between her symptoms and her behaviours’. The text messages to which I have referred suggested to Dr Neilssen that the accused had killed Mr Vaughan in response to the delusional beliefs which arose from her symptoms and that she was 'hence deprived of the capacity to recognise that her actions were morally wrong. Moreover, the acute exacerbation of her severe chronic mental illness around the time of the offence is likely to have deprived her of the capacity to recognise that her actions were morally wrong.'  
     
      
    20 In a report of 29 June 2009, Dr Westmore also noted the accused’s history of substance and alcohol abuse and mental illness and the ongoing treatment which she had received. He referred to reports of hearing voices and delusional beliefs of a paranoid type. Dr Westmore’s opinion was that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        On the balance of probability this woman was suffering from an acute exacerbation of her chronic mental illness. On that basis, I believe she could raise a mental illness defence to the charge of murder. She was suffering from a disease of the mind (paranoid schizophrenia) which, again on the balance of probability, would have totally deprived her of her capacity to know that she ought not to do the act. It is most likely in my view if she committed the offence then, in the absence of any other history, she was acting towards the deceased in a delusional way or as a result of delusional beliefs.  
        
       
       
      
    21 There were two further reports from Dr Westmore, in the last of which he noted that there had been memory difficulties and that while it was possible that the accused had achieved partial or even complete recollection of what had occurred, it was possible that the ‘accused finds it too difficult and or traumatic to discuss’. He also observed that while fragile, the accused was fit to be tried and well enough overall for the trial to proceed. The accused’s acceptance of the consequence of her acts at the trial confirmed that there was a basis for that view.  
     
      
       
      Proof of the charge 
       
      
    22 The onus falls on the Crown to prove beyond reasonable doubt the elements of the offence of murder with which the accused has been charged. They are that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. David Vaughan died. 
         
         
        2. That his death was caused by the acts of the accused, Tamie Melehan, by multiple stabbings. 
         
         
        3. That at the time of committing those acts Tamie Melehan intended either to kill David Vaughan or at least intended to cause grievous bodily harm. 
         
        
       
      
    23 As I have said, the accused has the benefit of the presumption of innocence. The Crown must prove all elements of the offence. Given the way in which the trial finally proceeded, there was no issue concerning proof of any of the elements of the offence. 
     
      
    24 On the evidence I find that Mr Vaughan’s death was caused by the fatal stab wounds which he received while with the accused at the accused’s home on 25 December 2008 and that those wounds were inflicted by the accused. There were a number of knives found in the accused’s home, where she was found with Mr Vaughan, after she called for her mother’s help. The accused’s text messages and conversation with Mr Bowcott showed that even before contacting her mother to seek her help in preventing her from slitting Mr Vaughan’s throat, the accused had already contacted Mr Bowcott, finally seeking his help in disposing of Mr Vaughan’s body. By the time she contacted her mother, the accused had already committed the act which she told her mother she needed help to prevent. The evidence has led me to be satisfied that it is beyond reasonable doubt that the accused, by her acts in repeatedly stabbing Mr Vaughan caused his death while possessing the requisite intent, namely of killing him.  
     
      
    25 The other issue to be determined is whether the accused has available to her the defence of mental illness. In that respect it should be noted that the position of the Crown was that the evidence was such that the Court would conclude that the defence had been made out. 
     
      
       
      The defence of mental illness 
       
      
    26 The defence of mental illness arises to be considered in accordance with s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. That section provides for a special verdict that an accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness. It provides that if the evidence at the trial establishes that the person was mentally ill, so as not to be responsible, according to law, for his or her action at the time when the act was done, then, if it appears that the person did the act, but was mentally ill at the time a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness must be returned. If a special verdict of not guilty by reason of mental illness is returned, the Court may remand the person in custody until the making of an order under section 39 of the Act in respect of the person. 
     
      
    27 The onus of proof of a defence of mental illness rests on the accused, on the balance of probabilities (see Mizzi v Regina [1960] HCA 77; (1960) 105 CLR 659). The term ‘mental illness’ is not defined in the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. The test which must be considered when a defence of mental illness is relied on, is discussed in Regina v M’Naghton (1843) 8 ER 718. Mentally ill in this context means suffering from a ‘defect of reason’ or ‘a disease of the mind’, so that the accused did not know the quality and nature of the physical acts which she was doing, or alternatively, if she did know, that she did not know that what she was doing was wrong. There is no suggestion in this case that the accused did not know the quality and nature of the physical acts which led to Mr Vaughan's death. The defence was pressed on the basis that owing to her disease of the mind, she did not know that what she was doing was wrong. 
     
      
    28 It is the accused who must establish that she was suffering from a mental illness. In this case there is no issue that the accused was suffering paranoid schizophrenia at the time of the offence. What the accused must further establish is that at the time that she stabbed Mr Vaughan, because of that mental illness, while she caused his death, she did not understand that what she was doing was wrong.  
     
      
    29 In Regina v Porter [1933] HCA 1; (1933) 55 CLR 182 at 189-90, Dixon J of the High Court explained that the accused must prove that the disease, disorder or disturbance of the mind from which she was suffering, whether arising from some infirmity, temporary or of long standing, was of such a character that she was not able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular acts she was doing at the particular time. His Honour explained at 189 - 90: 
     
      
       
        
        The question is whether he was able to appreciate the wrongness of the particular act he was doing at the particular time. Could this man be said to know in this sense whether his act was wrong if through a disease or defect or disorder of the mind he could not think rationally of the reasons which to ordinary people make that act right or wrong? If through the disordered condition of the mind he could not reason about the matter with a moderate degree of sense and composure it may be said that he could not know that what he was doing was wrong. What is meant by ""wrong""? What is meant by wrong is wrong having regard to the everyday standards of reasonable people. 
         
        
       
      
    30 In this case those questions must be answered having regard to the evidence as to the accused's outward conduct and the medical opinions which have been received. 
     
      
    31 I have outlined the opinions of the psychiatrists who examined the accused and who considered her medical history. Their opinions were consistent, namely that as a consequence of her mental illness, the accused was unable to understand that what she was doing was wrong and that the defence of mental illness is available to her. The experts' opinions, given the medical history on which it was based, were persuasive. 
     
      
    32 The evidence of the text messages which Mr Bowcott received; what the accused told him when she spoke to him on the phone shortly before 2 pm; what she told her mother shortly afterwards on the phone; what she said and was doing, when her mother arrived at her home; and how she behaved and what she said when spoken to by police officers and others at the scene, all support the conclusions which the psychiatrists reached. That evidence, too, suggested that the accused had a defect of reasoning resulting from the serious disease of the mind from which she suffers, with the result that she did not know that what she was doing to Mr Vaughan was wrong.  
     
      
    33 Section 37 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act requires that consideration be given to the legal and practical consequences of a finding of mental illness, including the existence and composition of the Mental Health Review Tribunal constituted under the Mental Health Act 2007 and its functions with respect to forensic patients.  
     
      
    34 The effect of an order made under s 38 is that provided for in s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, which provides: 
     
      
       
        
        39 Effect of finding and declaration of mental illness 
        (1) If, on the trial of a person charged with an offence, the jury returns a special verdict that the accused person is not guilty by reason of mental illness, the Court may order that the person be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law or may make such other order (including an order releasing the person from custody, either unconditionally or subject to conditions) as the Court considers appropriate. 
        (2) The Court is not to make an order under this section for the release of a person from custody unless it is satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, that the safety of the person or any member of the public will not be seriously endangered by the person’s release. 
        (3) As soon as practicable after the making of an order under this section, the Registrar of the Court is to notify the Minister for Health and the Tribunal of the terms of the order. 
        
       
      
    35 In this case the accused sought no order for her release. 
     
      
    36 The role and responsibilities of the Mental Health Review Tribunal were recently described by Hall J in Regina v Coleman [2010] NSWSC 177, a description which I respectfully adopt. His Honour observed:  
     
      
       
        
        69 The legal and practical consequences of a finding that the accused is “not guilty on the ground of mental illness” may be shortly stated.  
        70 The statute which governs cases like this, namely, s.39(1) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act, requires me to consider making an order that the accused be detained in such place and in such manner as the Court thinks fit until released by due process of law. In practice, this means not only that the accused remains in custody until a decision is made to release him, but also that he becomes what is known as a forensic patient and falls under the supervision of a body called the Mental Health Review Tribunal.  
        71 The Mental Health Review Tribunal consists of a president and his/her deputy, who must be a lawyer. It also consists of two other persons, one of whom must be a psychiatrist. The third member is a person who has suitable qualifications or experience for the task.  
        72 The Tribunal is required to review the accused’s case as soon as practicable after an order is made for his detention in strict custody. The Tribunal may make orders as to his continued detention, care or treatment, or as to this release.  
        73 The Tribunal cannot make an order for the release of the accused unless it is satisfied that the safety of that person or any member of the public would not be seriously endangered by his release. The Minister for Health and the Attorney General may appear before the Tribunal, or make submissions to the Tribunal, in relation to the possible release of the accused.  
        74 Where an order for release is not made, the Tribunal orders result in continued detention, care and treatment in a place and manner specified by the Tribunal.  
        75 After the initial review, the Tribunal must, at least once every six months, again review the case and make orders as to the accused’s continued detention, care or treatment in a hospital, prison or other place or as to his release.  
        76 If release is ordered, then it may be on conditions or it may be unconditional. If any condition is breached, or where the mental condition of the accused has deteriorated so that he may be a serious danger to others, a further order may be made by the Tribunal for his apprehension, care and detention.  
        77 The conditions which could be prescribed include matters such as living in a particular place, taking particular medication, appointments with health care professionals, enrolment in educational and therapeutic programmes, to ensure that the accused is properly cared for. Other than pursuant to any such release, the accused would remain, as I have said previously, in strict custody within one of the psychiatric institutions caring for forensic patients.  
        78 Security conditions (as necessary) are in place while the accused is detained in a hospital, prison or other place or if he is allowed to be temporarily absent from the place of detention. 79 The accused may be released from these restrictions if given an unconditional release, or where released on conditions and those conditions have expired over time. However, as I have previously explained, the accused will only ever be released when the Mental Health Review Tribunal is satisfied on the evidence available to it that his safety and the safety of any member of the public will not thereby be seriously endangered. 
        
       
       
      
    37 In this case, for the reasons I have explained, I am satisfied on the evidence, on the balance of probabilities, that the accused is not guilty of the offence with which she has been charged, on the ground of mental illness.  
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    38 For the reasons I have explained, I find that at the time that the accused committed the acts which caused the death of Mr Vaughan, that she was mentally ill so as not to be responsible in law for her acts. I am accordingly required to return a special verdict under s 38 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990. 
     
      
    39 Tamie Melehan, upon the charge that on 25 December 2008 at Gosford in the State of New South Wales you did murder David Vaughan, pursuant to the provisions of s 22(1)(a) of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, I find that you are not guilty by reason of mental illness.  
     
      
    40 I order that Tamie Melehan be detained, pursuant to s 39 of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990, in an appropriate correctional centre or such facility as the Mental Health Review Tribunal may determine until released by due process of law.  
     
      
    41 The Registrar is to notify the Minister of Health and the Mental Health Review Tribunal of the terms of the orders made by this Court and provide the Tribunal with copies of the exhibits in these proceedings.  
     
      
    42 Finally, I note that information concerning Mr Vaughan received from his family was put before the Court by the Crown, without objection. This material showed that Mr Vaughan had dealt bravely with the serious misfortune which life had brought him before his death. It also dealt with the impact which his death has had. This material has not gone without notice. I extend my deepest sympathy to Mr Vaughan’s family for the undoubted consequences of his tragic death.

   JUDGMENT1. I am sentencing Mark Edward Kipling for the crime of armed robbery. That is a crime under S 97(1) of the Crimes Act 1900. It carries a maximum of twenty years imprisonment. 2. Briefly what happened is that on 16 October 2007 Mr Kipling, armed with a twelve centimetre long stainless steel serrated-edge knife, robbed a corner shop in Burwood. Mr Kipling presented the knife to the shop-keeper and calmly asked him for money and was supplied with money by the shop-keeper. Mr Kipling made his escape but was detained the following day at Fairfield when he was said to be attempting to undertake some shop-lifting. 3. In the meantime Mr Kipling went to Queensland. The police did not have a strong case against him for the armed robbery until a year or so later when they applied for and were granted an arrest warrant. In Queensland Mr Kipling had been adding to a long record in that State of criminal offences by committing other offences for which he was sentenced by both the Magistrates’ Court and the District Court in that State. 4. In sentencing a person it is important to take into account the personal circumstances of the offender as well as the seriousness of the crime which they have committed. 5. In this case Mr Kipling pleaded guilty to the charge once he was confronted with it and Ms Pawliw who appears as prosecutor acknowledges that it was a plea made at the earliest available opportunity which Mr Kipling had available to him. 6. Mr Vertigan who appears for Mr Kipling has tendered a psychological report by a Peter Champion dated 25 February 2010. It sets out a history for Mr Kipling which does not appear to be controversial and appears to be consistent with his criminal record. It is a history which includes alcohol and drug addiction over many years. It also notes that he received a leg injury in 1992 which was a serious injury. I accept that as well because Mr Vertigan asked his client to show me the scar and deformity in his leg. 7. His employment history was reasonably good until the later 1990s when the leg injury effectively made it very difficult for him to continue to secure ready jobs. In addition, however, he had become addicted to heroin at the time of his leg injury. That was partly because he became dependent upon morphine when he was in hospital for some three months and was discharged with Panadeine forte which did not manage his pain. It is only relatively recently that he has been prescribed effective pain relief for his leg condition. 8. Mr Champion estimates, which is consistent with Mr Kipling’s criminal record, that he has spent many years in custody, much of that time in Queensland and he has been addicted to or exposed to taking various illegal drugs. When he went into prison in 2007 he decided to cease all substance abuse including cigarettes and has been, he says, drug and alcohol free since then. 9. Mr Kipling has a daughter who is eight years old and presently residing with her maternal grandmother and I have a reference from that person in which she acknowledges Mr Kipling’s desire to be reunited with his daughter and his daughter’s attitude that she would very much like to spend more time and to be reunited with her father.10. Mr Kipling acknowledged to Mr Champion that his behaviour had been wrong and that in particular the victim should not have been put through that experience. Mr Champion sensibly acknowledged that it would not be easy for Mr Kipling to overcome his addiction over the years and would need a post-release plan which would assist him. He recommended drug and alcohol programs both in custody and outside custody. In due course, subject to Mr Vertigan’s agreement, I will direct that a copy of Mr Champion’s report accompany Mr Kipling back into custody.11. Since he has been in custody in New South Wales he has been cooperative and worked well, having an acknowledgement of that from the Engineering Group which conducts a business and employs prisoners at the Parklea Correctional Centre. 12. Because he was in prison in Queensland he was not arrested for this offence until after his release from custody in Queensland. The release occurred on 9 June 2009 and he was arrested on 23 June 2009. At the time of his release from prison in Queensland he had been in prison for just over a year, having been arrested on 6 April 2008.13. His criminal record is, as I have said, extensive. Significantly it includes a previous offence for an armed robbery which occurred in 1996 and also a more recent offence of stealing from the person which occurred in 2005. This means that I have to put more weight, in sentencing Mr Kipling, on the need for a sentence which will deter him from inflicting members of the community with these sorts of crimes. 14. The objective seriousness of the offence I assess at just below the middle of the range. Both Mr Vertigan and Ms Pawliw agree with that assessment. Mr Kipling, as I have observed, is entitled to a discount on a sentence which he would otherwise receive because of his plea of guilty at the earliest available opportunity.15. He is presently aged forty-four and Mr Vertigan argues he may well be at a stage in his life where he is giving serious consideration to getting his life back on track. This seems to be consistent with his successful attempts at remaining drug and alcohol free for the last three years.16. Mr Vertigan also asked me to take into account that there had been some delay in Mr Kipling being dealt with for the crime that I am sentencing him for because of the time that he was in custody in Queensland. I propose to take that account in due course. 17. Both Ms Pawliw and Mr Vertigan drew my attention to the guideline judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Henry (1999) 46 NSWLR 346. The guideline applies to this offence and the factors are all relevant with the exception that Mr Kipling could not be regarded as a young offender with little criminal history. As I have said, his criminal history is not good and increases the need for specific deterrence. It is clearly a case which both legal representatives acknowledge where there is no other appropriate penalty than full-time custody.18. Mr Vertigan draws my attention to the statistics produced by the New South Wales Judicial Commission which I have taken into account to the extent that they are relevant. He also argues that special circumstances would warrant an adjustment in the normal ratio between the non-parole period of a sentence which I would impose on Mr Kipling and the balance of the term. He points to the risk that his client may be becoming institutionalised which is a risk which is somewhat supported by Mr Champion’s report and of the need for him to settle into normal community life outside custody. He also, of course, needs supervision for his alcohol and drug addictions.19. Taking into account these various factors, I would regard the commencement point for an overall sentence to be six years imprisonment. But because Mr Kipling has pleaded guilty at the earliest available opportunity and made the administration of justice more efficient and available to deal with other cases, I propose to discount that by twenty-five per cent so I would regard the appropriate overall penalty in this case to be fifty-four months or four and a half years imprisonment.20. The normal non-parole period for such a head sentence would be in the region of forty months or three years and four months representing seventy-five per cent of the head sentence. But I propose to accept Mr Vertigan’s submissions that there are special circumstances for adjusting the ratio between the non-parole and the balance of the term. And I propose to fix a non-parole period of two and one half years. I propose to take into account to some extent the delay brought about by the fact that he was in custody in Queensland when he might have been charged with this offence and dealt with. And I propose to backdate that sentence by six months so that the current sentence which I am imposing now will commence on 23 December 2008. 21. Please stand up Mr Kipling. I sentence you to four and a half years in prison. The non-parole period will commence on 23 December 2008 and expire on 22 June 2011, that is two and a half years. The balance of the term will be two years commencing 23 June 2011 and expiring on 22 June 2013. Have a seat Mr Kipling for a moment.HIS HONOUR: So I’ll ask both Mr Vertigan and Ms Pawliw whether there are any factual errors which I have made or any omissions. And also the mathematics whether my dates coincide with what I announced the sentence to be. So there’s two things. Take your time.VERTIGAN: I’m terrible with dates but I’m grateful my friend is making very careful notes about it. Your Honour, there was one, I think. I think I may have misspoken in relation to the year in which my client decided to shed drug use and the like. Your Honour said 1997, I think it should have been 2007. That is when he went into custody in Queensland.HIS HONOUR: Did I say - yes. It’s 2007 that he made the decision to remain drug and alcohol free.VERTIGAN: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: The transcript should reflect that I direct. Yes.VERTIGAN: Your Honour, the other matter was this: your Honour referred to the steal from person conviction in the Queensland record. I did not refer to that when I was addressing your Honour as to like offences. I don’t cavil with that except for the record I did not refer to it as such, because as your Honour would be aware, steal from person offences can occur without violence being involved. It was on that basis I had addressed your Honour so less there be any question elsewhere but I can’t really see that arising, with respect your Honour.HIS HONOUR: No, no, thank you.PAWLIW: Your Honour, I only referred but just for the record being it is still a robbery offence, robbery type offence.HIS HONOUR: And now what about the mathematics.PAWLIW: I’ve calculated that it’s correct.HIS HONOUR: Correct?PAWLIW: Yes.HIS HONOUR: And Ms Pawliw do you have any submissions so far as any factual errors or omissions?PAWLIW: Not as far as I’m aware.HIS HONOUR: Okay. It’s not a matter where I direct parole because it’s more than three years.VERTIGAN: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: So I think - subject to explaining in a moment to Mr Kipling - that completes the sentence doesn’t it. There’s no other orders that I need to make?VERTIGAN: No, your Honour, but if your Honour would give me one moment,.HIS HONOUR: Yes. It’s a question about Mr Champion’s report.VERTIGAN: Yes.PAWLIW: Your Honour that is subject to supervision whilst on parole. I think there are sterner conditions in any respect.VERTIGAN: Your Honour there’s no difficulty with attaching the report to the warrant?HIS HONOUR: All right I will provide exhibit 1 which is unmarked to my associate, ask her to photocopy it and that should accompany Mr Kipling back into custody. And just whilst you were talking to your client `Ms Pawliw you’ve mentioned any conditions of parole which I don’t think I fix. I don’t. But I would recommend that the Parole Board give consideration to the matters raised by Mr Champion and especially alcohol and drug counselling.VERTIGAN: Your Honour, Mr Kipling asked one more indulgence. It would not, of course, be binding but would your Honour make a recommendation he serve the balance of his non-parole period at Grafton gaol. Were the authorities to follow that it would mean he would be closer to his family and better able to re-establish ties.HIS HONOUR: I recommend that Mr Kipling be able to serve the balance of his non-parole period at Grafton Correctional Centre for the reasons which Mr Vertigan has just mentioned.VERTIGAN: Thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Okay, anything else.VERTIGAN: No.22. Mr Kipling you have received four and a half years. You would have received six years but you got twenty-five per cent off the six years because you pleaded guilty at the earliest time. Normally with a four and half year sentence you have to serve seventy-five per cent of that so you would have been in gaol for three years and four months but I have accepted what Mr Vertigan says and I have reduced it to two and a half years because you need more time on parole. And I have backdated your sentence by six months because of the delay: you were in custody in Queensland. This matter could have been processed and it might have got on sooner. So I am going to - I have - backdated it so it commenced on 23 December 08. Your non-parole period ends 22 June 2011. That is the first date on which you are eligible to be released on parole. The system down here, which you may or may not know, I do not order parole for a sentence. The Parole Authority assesses it and if they think that you should get parole then they will direct you to get parole. Earliest date 22 June next year then you remain under that sentence for the following two years from 23 June 2011 to 22 June 2013 on parole - provided you get parole - and your sentence expires finally on 22 June 2013.HIS HONOUR: Do you understand all that?OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Is there anything else?VERTIGAN: No, your Honour.PAWLIW: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right, good luck Mr Kipling. Mr Kipling can be taken down.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 MACFARLAN JA: The appellant was tried and convicted on an indictment containing three Counts to the following effect: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Between 1 February 2001 and 31 May 2001 the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person under 16 years of age, namely of the age of 9 years, without her consent and knowing that she was not consenting; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: Between 1 February 2001 and 31 May 2001 the appellant indecently assaulted the complainant, a person under 10 years of age, namely of the age of 9 years; and 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: Between 1 September 2002 and 30 November 2002 the appellant had sexual intercourse with the complainant, a person under 16 years of age, namely of the age of 10 or 11 years, without her consent, and knowing that she was not consenting. 
        
       
      
    2 Counts 1 and 3 were allegations of offences under s 61J of the Crimes Act 1900 which in relevant respects was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) Any person who has sexual intercourse with another person without the consent of the other person and in circumstances of aggravation and who knows that the other person does not consent to the sexual intercourse is liable to imprisonment for 20 years. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) In this section,  
        circumstances of aggravation 
         means circumstances in which: 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        (d) the alleged victim is under the age of 16 years, … 
        
       
       
        
        …”. 
        
       
      
    3 Count 2 was an allegation of a breach of s 61M(2) of the Crimes Act, which provided for a maximum penalty of ten years’ imprisonment. The maximum penalty under s 61J was twenty years’ imprisonment. 
     
      
    4 Following the appellant’s plea of not guilty to each Count, his trial occurred at Albury District Court over three days in November 2007. He was convicted on each Count. On 5 February 2008 he was sentenced by the trial judge to terms of imprisonment as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        Count 1: Seven years’ non-parole period to date from 15 November 2007 and to expire on 14 November 2014, with a balance of term of three years expiring on 14 November 2017; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: Four and a half years’ non-parole period to date from 15 November 2007 and to expire on 14 May 2012, with a balance of term of one and a half years; and 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: Six years’ non-parole period to date from 15 May 2012 and to expire on 14 May 2018, with a balance of term of four years expiring on 14 May 2022. 
        
       
      
    5 The result was that the appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of fourteen and a half years with a ten and a half years’ non-parole period. The sentence on the second Count was wholly concurrent with that on the first Count and the non-parole period on the third Count was concurrent with that on the first Count as to two and a half years. 
     
      
    6 The appellant appeals against his conviction on the first and third Counts and seeks leave to appeal against the sentences imposed upon him in respect of the three Counts. 
     
      
       
      Factual circumstances 
       
      
    7 The complainant was the same in respect of each Count. Prior to the alleged offences, the appellant had for about two years been in a relationship with the complainant’s mother. He often stayed at the house in which the complainant lived with her mother and younger sister.  
     
      
    8 In his Remarks on Sentence, the trial judge described the circumstances giving rise to the indictment as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[The complainant] recalled that in early 2001 when she was aged nine whilst they were living at [the first address], she was in the lounge room of that dwelling with the prisoner lying on the lounge while she was on the floor. He directed her to come up onto the lounge. She did so but sat at the other end from him. He said, ‘No, not there, up here’, and then pulled her up onto the lounge positioning her, the child, on top of his body. He then pulled down both his pants and hers and inserted his penis into her vagina which action caused her considerable pain. 
        
       
       
        
        The victim’s mother arrived home. The prisoner told her, ‘Don’t tell mum’ and put her down, and then I think the mother, the daughter and a friend all went on some expedition gathering yabbies. 
        
       
       
        
        This was said to have occurred between February and May 2001, and during that same period the second count was laid. It related to an occasion on which the victim had gone into her mother’s room to find the prisoner lying in bed. He was naked. He took hold of her hand and placed it on his penis. She removed her hand and left the room. This is the count under s 61M(2). 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        The third count is laid as having occurred in the latter half of 2002. It was at another address, … . The victim was asleep in her bedroom when she alleged, and the jury obviously accepted, that she was awoken to find the prisoner getting into her bed. 
        
       
       
        
        He pulled down her pyjamas and inserted his penis into her vagina. She was saying to him, ‘Stop it, stop it’ and crying so that he eventually, telling her not to tell her mother, left the room, and she pulled the blanket over her head and then went to sleep [sic]”. 
        
       
       
      The conviction appeal 
       
       
      Misdirection 
       
      
    9 The appellant contended that there had been a miscarriage of justice because the trial judge misdirected the jury about the essential elements of the offences to which Counts 1 and 3 related. In particular, he argued that the trial judge had directed the jury that it need not consider the allegations in the indictment that the appellant did not consent to sexual intercourse with the complainant and that the appellant knew that the complainant was not consenting, because, as a matter of law, the complainant was, by reason of her age, incapable of consenting to sexual intercourse. 
     
      
    10 The Crown conceded on the appeal that this was the effect of the judge’s directions to the jury and that the directions were erroneous. The relevant part of the judge’s summing-up was in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “The Crown has to prove that [the complainant] was not consenting, and of course, she could not consent because she is under sixteen. No child can consent to an act of sexual intercourse. You might think that that element by itself is proved beyond any question. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        So the real issue in this trial – I mean, the Crown has to prove those other elements, but you might think the Crown does not have any difficulty with those elements about the absence of consent, and of course, the accused if he did the things that [the complainant] says he did, would have understood that she was not in a position to consent, so there cannot be any argument about that - the real issue is, did this act of penetration to any degree at all take place; has the Crown proven that beyond reasonable doubt or not?” 
        
       
      
    11 The Crown’s concession was properly made. The judge was in error in indicating to the jury that the complainant, because she was under the age of 16, was, in effect, to be deemed not to have consented to sexual intercourse for the purposes of the offences alleged in Counts 1 and 3, which charged breaches of s 61J. Certainly, it is no defence to a charge under s 66A of having sexual intercourse with a child under the age of ten years that the child consented, nor to a charge under s 66C of having sexual intercourse with a child above the age of ten years but less than sixteen years that the child consented. However s 61J, the section under which the appellant was charged in respect of Counts 1 and 3, specifically makes the absence of consent and knowledge of that absence of consent elements of the offence. As a result, those matters must, irrespective of the victim’s age, be proved beyond reasonable doubt for a person to be convicted of an offence against s 61J. 
     
      
       
      Application of the Proviso 
       
      
    12 The question then arises whether, by reason of the trial judge’s misdirection of the jury, the appellant’s conviction on the Counts under s 61J should be set aside or whether the proviso to s 6(1) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 should be applied. In relevant respects that proviso permits the court to dismiss an appeal against conviction, notwithstanding that an appellant has made out a case for the setting aside of a conviction, if the court “considers that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred”. 
     
      
    13 In favour of applying the proviso is the fact that the case conducted by the appellant at trial was quite inconsistent with the proposition that sexual intercourse with the complainant had occurred with the complainant’s consent. In circumstances where the jury had plainly accepted the complainant’s evidence so as to find that the sexual intercourse complained of had in fact occurred, there was not in my view any rational basis upon which the jury could, on the evidence, have come to the conclusion that the complainant consented to the sexual intercourse or that the appellant was unaware of the complainant’s lack of consent.  
     
      
    14 The principal evidence in chief of the complainant was to the effect of the passages from the Remarks on Sentence quoted in [8] above, although importantly she also gave evidence that she made protestations to the appellant in respect of both acts of intercourse. The case of the appellant, as put through the cross-examination of the complainant and in address, was, as the Crown described in its Summary of Trial, that the complainant “fabricated the allegations because she hated the Appellant and aimed to break up the relationship between the Appellant and her mother”.  
     
      
    15 The complainant was cross-examined extensively on behalf of the appellant to suggest that she disliked the appellant and bore animosity towards him for a variety of reasons. Neither the questions nor answers in this cross-examination (nor in that of any of the other witnesses called in the Crown’s case) suggested that the complainant had given her consent to intercourse or that there was any reason why she may have done so. The complainant’s evidence of the offences incorporated reference to express protestations, and, therefore, to communications to the appellant of the complainant’s lack of consent. In light of the nature of the attack made on the complainant’s evidence by the appellant, the jury could not in my view rationally have accepted her evidence about the instances of sexual intercourse without accepting her evidence of their circumstances, including her protestations. That possibility was not in any way raised for its consideration through the appellant’s cross-examination of her. 
     
      
    16 The appellant did not give evidence or call any other witnesses and, in his closing address at the trial, counsel for the appellant submitted that there was evidence of “intense hate” of the complainant of the appellant. Attacking the complainant’s evidence that sexual intercourse had occurred, he submitted that this hate constituted “a very powerful motive to lie” and that the complainant had been shown to be a “liar” who “made up” evidence. This was consistent with the case which he had earlier put through the cross-examination, on the appellant’s behalf, of the complainant. 
     
      
    17 In Wilde v The Queen [1988] HCA 6; (1987-1988) 164 CLR 365, Brennan, Dawson and Toohey JJ referred to the authorities which are customarily cited in relation to the application of the proviso as establishing “that where there has been a departure from the requirements of a properly conducted trial, it cannot be said that there has been no substantial miscarriage of justice if the applicant has thereby lost ‘a chance which was fairly open to him of being acquitted’ to use the phrase of Fullagar J in Mraz v The Queen or ‘a real chance of acquittal’ to use the phrase of Barwick CJ in Reg. v Storey” (at 371-2, citations omitted). Their Honours however went on to say: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is one thing to apply the proviso to prevent the administration of the criminal law from being ‘plunged into outworn technicality’ (the phrase of Barwick CJ in  
        Driscoll v The Queen 
        , ((1977) 137 CLR, at p 527)); it is another to uphold a conviction after a proceeding which is fundamentally flawed, merely because the appeal court is of the opinion that on a proper trial the appellant would inevitably have been convicted. The proviso has no application where an irregularity has occurred which is such a departure from the essential requirements of the law that it goes to the root of the proceedings. If that has occurred, then it can be said, without considering the effect of the irregularity upon the jury's verdict, that the accused has not had a proper trial and that there has been a substantial miscarriage of justice. Errors of that kind may be so radical or fundamental that by their very nature they exclude the application of the proviso: see  
        Reg. v Hildebrandt 
         ((1963) 81 WN (Pt 1) (NSW) 143, at p 148);  
        Reg. v Henderson 
         ([1966] VR 41, at p 43) 
        ; Reg. v Couper 
         ((1985) 18 A Crim. R 1, at pp 7-8).  
         
         
        There is no rigid formula to determine what constitutes such a radical or fundamental error. It may go either to the form of the trial or the manner in which it was conducted. There are those cases which identify irregularities which are sufficient to vitiate a trial and afford a basis for a writ of venire de novo. They are concerned more with the form of the trial but even in that area they provide no real touchstone for determining when an irregularity is so serious as to cause a mistrial: see Cooke, ""Venire de Novo"" Law Quarterly Review, Vol 71 (1955) 100, at p 128;  
        Reg. v Rose 
         ([1982] 1 WLR 614, at pp 621-622; [1982] 2 All ER 536 at p 542); and, in the House of Lords ([1982] AC 822 at pp 831-834). But the wording of the proviso is quite general and it is clear that it may be applied notwithstanding a misdirection concerning the law or the wrongful admission of evidence. In the end no mechanical approach can be adopted and each case must be determined upon its own circumstances” (at 373). 
        
       
      
    18 Wilde v The Queen was referred to with approval by Gaudron, Gummow, Kirby and Hayne JJ in Krakouer v The Queen [1998] HCA 43; (1998) 194 CLR 202 at [23]. Their Honours said in that case that they “were not persuaded that the fact that there has been a misdirection about one element of the offence with which an accused is charged means that the trial was necessarily fundamentally flawed” and said that “[s]imply demonstrating that there was a misdirection on a matter relevant to the jury’s consideration is not sufficient” to preclude the application of the proviso (at [23]). 
     
      
    19 In Krakouer, the appellant had been charged with conspiring and attempting to possess a prohibited drug with intent to sell or supply it to another. Section 11(a) of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 (WA) deemed, unless the contrary was proved, a person to be in possession of a prohibited drug with intent to sell or supply to another if the quantity of the drug was not less than a specified quantity. 
     
      
    20 The trial judge erroneously directed the jury that the deeming provision applied to the offences with which the appellant had been charged. He did so in opposition to contentions both from the appellant and the Crown. The appellant was convicted. 
     
      
    21 The view expressed in the plurality judgment in that case was that if the appellant had not lost a “real chance of acquittal”, the case was an appropriate one for application of the proviso. As in the present case, the misdirection related to a fundamental element of the offences charged. Unlike the present case however, consideration of that element was not withdrawn altogether from the jury’s consideration. There, the jury was told, in effect, that the element was established, subject to proof by the appellant to the contrary. The misdirection was thus as to the onus of proof.  
     
      
    22 The misdirection in the present case went further because it was not suggested to the jury that the appellant could rebut the presumption which was said to exist as to the absence of the complainant’s consent. However, I do not consider that this is a sufficient basis for distinguishing the decision in Krakouer. The principle is in my view the same in each instance: the misdirections diverted the jury from proper consideration of fundamental elements of the offences charged. 
     
      
    23 The plurality in Krakouer proceeded to consider whether the appellant there had lost a “real chance of acquittal”. It concluded that conviction was not inevitable (at [37]) and that the appellant’s convictions should be quashed. It pointed out that at the trial the appellant “had made no point about intention to sell or supply” (at [26]) and that such a point was made for the first time at the hearing of the appeal to the High Court (at [28]). However, as the point was not devoid of merit, and particularly as objection to the misdirection had been taken at the trial, it could not be said that the appellant did not lose a real chance of acquittal. 
     
      
    24 No similar point is available in the present case. As explained above (see [13] – [16]), the trial was conducted, throughout, on behalf of the appellant upon the basis that sexual intercourse had not occurred. His case, as put through cross-examination and in address, was inconsistent with intercourse having occurred with the consent of the complainant. In address on appeal, counsel for the appellant referred to submissions made at the trial by counsel for the appellant to the effect that the complainant would not have associated with the appellant in ways he identified if her evidence as to sexual intercourse were correct, and that her cries would have been heard by the complainant’s mother if sexual intercourse had occurred. However, these submissions at the trial were plainly directed to persuading the jury that it should not accept the complainant’s evidence that intercourse had occurred. Not the slightest suggestion was made at the trial that intercourse may have occurred with the complainant’s consent. 
     
      
    25 The present case is accordingly distinguishable from Krakouer in that there is no point raised, either at the trial or on appeal, which suggests that the appellant would have had a real chance of acquittal if the misdirection had not occurred. 
     
      
    26 In Krakouer, McHugh J was in dissent on the question of whether the trial was fundamentally flawed. His view was that the trial judge’s direction took the critical issue of intent to sell or supply to another out of the jury’s hands, thereby substituting “trial by direction for trial by jury” (at [74]). He considered that matters such as the standard or onus of proof or the functions of the jury “go to the root of the criminal trial according to law”. He said, in support of the conclusion to which he came on this issue: 
     
      
       
        
        “An accused person is entitled to a trial according to law. Where the law requires that an issue be tried by a jury, the accused does not have a trial in any meaningful sense where the jury is prevented by judicial direction from determining the issue. It is of no relevance in my opinion that a court of criminal appeal thinks that the evidence of guilt is overwhelming. An accused is entitled to be tried by the jury. That is the tribunal that is given the responsibility for determining the guilt of an accused person” (at [75]). 
        
       
      
    27 The views of McHugh J would, in my view, require the convictions in the present case on Counts 1 and 3 to be quashed. However I consider that the views of the plurality indicate that the appeal should be dismissed. That is the course which I therefore propose. 
     
      
    28 I consider that the decision of this Court in R v Gulliford [2004] NSWCCA 338; (2004) 148 A Crim R 558 supports the view that the convictions in this case should stand. In that case, the trial judge gave, in respect of a charge under s 61I of the Crimes Act, erroneous directions as to the requirement that the accused know that the other person “does not consent to the sexual intercourse” (see then current s 61R). Wood CJ at CL (with whom Howie J agreed) concluded that the misdirection did not cost the appellant a real chance of acquittal and that the proviso should be applied. He observed that “[i]t was never the case of the appellant that he had intercourse with [the complainant], or had attempted to do so, with her consent. It was his case that he did not have intercourse with her, and did not attempt to do so” (at [116]). He found that the “only rational inference that was … open, was that [the appellant] knew that [the complainant’s] submission … was non consensual but was forced” (at [118]). His Honour referred to the plurality judgment in Krakouer (see [18] – [23] above) but did not suggest that the misdirection resulted in the trial being fundamentally flawed.  
     
      
    29 Spigelman CJ dissented as to the application of the proviso but did so, not upon the basis that the misdirection as to consent resulted in the trial being fundamentally flawed but upon the basis that, on his assessment of the trial, the misdirection did cost the appellant a real chance of acquittal. 
     
      
    30 The appellant in the present case sought to distinguish Gulliford upon the basis that in that case, unlike the present, there were “really quite comprehensive directions on consent”, albeit erroneous in an important respect. I do not consider that this is a difference which is of significance for present purposes.  
     
      
    31 Spigelman CJ has recently observed that in this context the High Court has emphasised in recent case law “that it is important not to be distracted from the statutory language of whether there has been a ‘substantial miscarriage of justice’” (Doja v R [2009] NSWCCA 303 at [52]). For the reasons I have given there has not in my view been a substantial miscarriage of justice in this case. 
     
      
    32 As the point as to misdirection, with which I have just dealt, was not taken at the trial, rule 4 of the Criminal Appeal Rules required the leave of this Court for it to be taken on appeal. As the point is an arguable one and one of some general significance, I would grant leave but, for the reasons I have given, nevertheless dismiss the appeal. 
     
      
    33 If (contrary to my view) it were appropriate to set aside the appellant’s convictions on Counts 1 and 3, the Court would have been empowered by the combined operation of s 7(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act and s 61Q(3) of the Crimes Act to substitute for the jury’s verdict a verdict of guilty of an offence under s 66A of the Crimes Act (Sexual intercourse – child under 10) in respect of Count 1 and s 66C of the Crimes Act (Sexual intercourse – child between 10 and 16) in respect of Count 3. Both parties accepted on the appeal that the jury verdicts indicated that the jury must have been satisfied of the facts which rendered the appellant guilty of offences under these sections. 
     
      
       
      The application for leave to appeal against sentence 
       
      
    34 The grounds upon which the appellant seeks leave to appeal are, first, that the trial judge “has wrongly taken into account subsequent standard non-parole periods” and, secondly, that “the sentences are manifestly excessive”. 
     
      
    35 The offences of which the appellant was convicted were committed between 1 February and 31 May 2001 as to the first two Counts and between 1 September 2002 and 30 November 2002 as to the third. The judge was obliged to sentence the appellant in accordance with the law and practices prevailing at the date of the commission of his offences (R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; (2002) 54 NSWLR 368). 
     
      
    36 In his Remarks on Sentence, the judge noted that the three offences of which the appellant was convicted took place before the introduction of the concept of standard non-parole periods by an amendment to the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, which took effect from 1 February 2003 (see Pt 4, Div 1A of that Act). His Honour said that the concept had no “direct bearing” upon the sentencing of the appellant and continued as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “It would, however, be extraordinary in my view that the court should ignore the clear legislative intent evinced as from 1 February 2003 that offences of this nature should be regarded as meriting the most condign punishment. 
        
       
       
        
        Following  
        Way’s 
         case, of course the Court of Criminal Appeal has decided that standard non-parole periods do not apply in circumstances where a plea of guilty has been entered. Nonetheless the court ruled that the standard non-parole periods remain as a guideline to which the court must have regard in posting a sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        I do not think it is possible to exclude entirely the effect of those guidelines, even on sentences for crimes which were committed shortly before the operation of the section itself, but I have placed no great reliance upon the standard non-parole periods prescribed which I record simply for purposes of completeness as being ten years in connection with s 61J(1) offences and five years [in fact, increased to eight years by the date of sentencing] for the 61M(2) offence. 
        
       
       
        
        The s 61M(2) offence being, as I had occasion to remark only the other day, extraordinary in that it fixes a standard non-parole period of proportions far in excess (in relation to the head sentence) of anything else I have ever seen in the law, but it has no bearing in this case. Nonetheless these are extremely serious offences and there has been a burgeoning awareness on the part of both the legislature and the courts that offences of this nature require the most serious approach to punishment”. 
        
       
      
    37 In my view, the proper conclusion to be drawn from these passages is that the judge was to some extent influenced by the standard non-parole periods prescribed after the dates of the offences and by an increasing seriousness attached to offences of that character, as reflected by judicial decision, as well as by the introduction of the standard non-parole periods. His Honour’s use of the expressions “no direct bearing”, “extraordinary … that the Court should ignore the clear legislative intent”, “exclude entirely” and “no great reliance” (emphases added) indicate that account was taken of these matters. The judge’s reference to the “burgeoning awareness … that offences of this nature require the most serious approach to punishment” does this also. 
     
      
    38 In these circumstances, it is necessary to adjust the sentences imposed to reflect any difference that existed between the relevant sentencing practices at the date of conviction and those at the time of the offences. Apart from seeking this adjustment and complaining generally as to the manifest excessiveness of the sentence, no particular objections were taken by the appellant as to the views expressed by the judge in the course of sentencing. It is accordingly sufficient to refer only briefly to those views. 
     
      
    39 First, the judge did not consider the emotional harm or damage done to the complainant to be so severe that it was out of “the range of, or the parameters of damage always done to children who are subjected to this form of abuse”. Secondly, he accepted that, because of the complainant’s “extreme youth” and the relationship which existed between the complainant and the appellant, the subject offences were ones “falling towards the higher end of the range of seriousness for offences of this nature”. 
     
      
    40 As to subjective factors, the judge noted that the appellant had a criminal record but “not of anything involving gravely serious criminal behaviour”. He also noted that because the appellant had exercised his right to decline to discuss the offences with the doctor who examined him and with the officer preparing the pre-sentence report, “we have absolutely no idea of what he might say about any potentially ameliorating circumstances involving these offences, and it cannot be suggested that there is any display of contrition or remorse”. After consideration of the pre-sentence report and of the medical evidence, the judge said he was not “persuaded that I should find his prospects of rehabilitation are good” and adopted “an entirely neutral stance in relation to that aspect”. 
     
      
    41 His Honour took account of the fact that the incarceration would be the appellant’s first time in custody and that because of the nature of his offences he would “probably not become part of the general population of the prison”. He made some reduction in the non-parole period in respect of these factors, “but not a major one”. He concluded by saying that none of the offences could be regarded as a “single aberration” and that they were “serious offences for which there must be serious sentences”. 
     
      
    42 The difficulties in determining what sentencing practice was at a prior point of time were referred to by Mason P in R v MJR at [54] – [55]. His Honour pointed out that the premise upon which that case proceeded was that the pattern of sentences for child sexual assault had increased over time (at [57]). After that case was decided, standard non-parole periods, which appear to have reflected a more serious treatment of child sexual assaults than what prevailed hitherto, came into force.  
     
      
    43 In the present case, the appellant submitted that from the date of the decision in R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58 (13 March 2002) until the commencement of the standard non-parole period regime, “there was a noticeable change in sentencing practice” in relation to sexual offences, involving the more serious treatment of those offences. The Crown did not contend that sentences for sexual offences had not increased but submitted that that increase began to occur prior to the introduction of standard non-parole periods, referring in that connection to the acknowledgement by the appellant that such sentences were increasing from the date of R v AEM. 
     
      
    44 In these circumstances, it is appropriate to regard sentences imposed in respect of child sexual offences after the introduction of relevant standard non-parole periods in February 2003 as generally more severe than they were in 2001 when the first two offences were committed. The same comment is applicable to the period when the third offence was committed, although it has less force because this period followed the decision in R v AEM in March 2002.  
     
      
    45 The sentences imposed by the judge should be set aside as he appears to have had some regard in sentencing the appellant to the subsequently introduced standard non-parole periods. It is appropriate that the re-sentencing of the appellant reflect the sentences originally imposed, subject to adjustments to exclude the impact of changes to sentencing occurring after the date of the offences. 
     
      
    46 Bearing in mind that the standard non-parole periods subsequently introduced were 10 years in respect of s 61J offences and five years (subsequently increased to 8 years) in respect of s 61M(2) offences, and bearing in mind the judge’s findings on objective and subjective factors, it does not appear that the influence of those standard non-parole periods on his Honour’s sentencing was a substantial one. Accordingly, whilst I consider that an adjustment should be made, it should be a small one. 
     
      
    47 In my view a period of one year should be deducted from the non-parole period in respect of each the sentences on Counts 1 and 2 and six months in respect of the sentence on Count 3. Some limited adjustments should also be made to the balances of the terms and their commencement dates. The balance of the term of imprisonment that I propose in respect of Count 3 exceeds one-third of the sentence on that Count (compare s 44(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act). However, that is justified by “special circumstances” within the meaning of that subsection, as, if the balance of term for that sentence were shorter, the overall effective balance of term of the sentences would be less than one-third of the overall effective non-parole periods (see MAJW v R [2009] NSWCCA 255 at [54]). This would not be appropriate as the ratio of one-third:two-thirds should in my view be maintained in respect of the overall sentences in the present case. The alternative course of fixing a shorter non-parole period for Count 3 would not in my view be appropriate as it would reduce the overall effective non-parole period below what I regard as the period necessary to reflect the gravity of the offences of which the appellant was convicted. 
     
      
    48 In forming a view as to the appropriate adjustments, I have taken into account affidavits filed on behalf of the appellant as to efforts he has made whilst in prison to undertake various courses and to engage in library and cleaning work. 
     
      
    49 The remaining ground upon which leave to appeal against the sentences is brought is that the sentences imposed by his Honour were manifestly excessive. When adjusted as I have proposed, the sentences in my view fall well within the range of sentences appropriate for offences of this seriousness involving, as they did, the gross abuse by the appellant of the complainant when she was, as the sentencing judge said, “in a position in which she was entitled to repose trust in the prisoner”. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    50 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
      (1) Dismiss the appeal against conviction on Counts 1 and 3 of the Indictment. 
       
       
      (2) Grant leave to the appellant to appeal against sentence. 
       
       
      (3) Set aside the sentences imposed on the appellant on 5 February 2008. 
       
       
      (4) In respect of the three offences of which he was convicted, sentence the appellant to terms of imprisonment as follows: 
       
       
        
        Count 1: Six years’ non-parole period to date from 15 November 2007 and to expire on 14 November 2013, with a balance of term of two years expiring on 14 November 2015; 
        
       
       
        
        Count 2: Three and a half years’ non-parole period to date from 15 November 2007 and to expire on 14 May 2011, with a balance of term of one year expiring on 14 May 2012; and 
        
       
       
        
        Count 3: Five and a half years’ non-parole period to date from 15 May 2011 and to expire on 14 November 2016, with a balance of term of three years expiring on 14 November 2019.  
        
       
      
    51 BLANCH J: I have had the advantage of reading the judgment of Macfarlan JA in draft. His Honour sets out the relevant facts and I agree with his Honour’s conclusion that this is an appropriate case for this Court to exercise the proviso because I consider that no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred. Because the direction given in the summing up appears on the face of it to have deprived the appellant of the jury’s consideration of an essential element of the first and third counts in the indictment I wish to add my own reasons for the decision. 
     
      
    52 The only argument advanced on behalf of the appellant at his trial was that no sexual assault had occurred on any of the three occasions. That by itself may not have precluded the jury from considering whether or not the complainant had consented to the sexual acts. Such consideration might have arisen from the fact that the alleged offences occurred between February 2001 and September 2002 but no complaint was made until March 2006. Bearing in mind the way the trial was conducted, it would not have been possible for defence counsel to make such a submission to the jury because it would be quite contrary to his instructions and other submissions. 
     
      
    53 However, the defence case was conducted not simply on the basis of denying the allegations of the complainant but also on the basis of asserting the motive of the complainant in making the complaint was because she hated the appellant. The complainant was cross-examined as follows: 
     
      
       
      Q. You used to tell [the complainant’s cousin] how much you hated the accused. 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
      Q. Because he pushed and shoved you. 
       
      A. I remember he used to hit me. 
       
      Q. And that was part of the basis for hating him. 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
      Q. You used to say to [the complainant’s cousin] I hate Roger. 
       
      A. Yes. 
       
      
    54 In submissions to the jury counsel for the defence said: “She conceded it herself, that is [the complainant], conceded that hate that existed prior to this alleged incident [at the home]. A hate based upon a child’s desire that she not be told what to do by a father that was acting as a stepfather figure to her.” He went on to say: “… it was hate spawned by what appear to be ordinary lawful incidents of someone acting instead of a parent.” 
     
      
    55 Those submissions are entirely inconsistent with any suggestion that the complainant had consensual intercourse with the appellant. I believe for that reason the appellant did not lose a real chance of acquittal within the meaning of the authorities referred to in the judgment of Macfarlan JA. 
     
      
    56 A further problem in assessing if I consider no substantial miscarriage of justice has actually occurred is that the relief sought by the appellant is the substitution of verdicts under s66A of the Crimes Act in place of the convictions under s61J of the Crimes Act. The maximum penalty under s61J is 20 years imprisonment. The maximum penalty under s66A is 25 years or life imprisonment if the offence is committed in circumstances of aggravation which includes a circumstance where the victim is under the authority of the offender. In my view, bearing in mind the complainant was aged nine and ten at the time of the commission of the offences, no lesser penalty than that proposed could be considered appropriate. I agree for the reasons given by Macfarlan JA that the sentence imposed should be reduced as proposed by him. 
     
      
    57 JOHNSON J: I have had the considerable advantage of reading the judgments of Macfarlan JA and Blanch J. I agree with their Honours’ conclusions with respect to the appeal against conviction which, in my view, ought be dismissed. I agree with their Honours with respect to sentence, but wish to make some additional comments on that issue. 
     
      
    58 From time to time, sentencing courts must grapple with changing sentencing regimes when imposing sentence upon a particular offender. One scenario arises where an offender is to be sentenced for crimes committed many years (if not decades) before: R v Moon [2000] NSWCCA 534; 117 A Crim R 497; R v MJR [2002] NSWCCA 129; 54 NSWLR 368. Following trial, the Appellant stood for sentence on 5 February 2008 for offences committed between February 2001 and November 2002. This was not a case falling within this category.  
     
      
    59 A second scenario arises where an offender is to be sentenced for a crime which, by the time sentence comes to be passed, has been abolished: R v Pritchard [1999] NSWCCA 182; 107 A Crim R 88; Orkopolous v R [2009] NSWCCA 213 at [97]-[100]. That is not this case. 
     
      
    60 The case lies in a third category. The present offences were committed within a two-year period before the commencement on 1 February 2003 of the standard non-parole period system applicable to offences under s.61J and s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900. Express statutory provision was made so that the standard non-parole period system did not apply to offences committed before 1 February 2003: cl.45(1), Schedule 2, Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. As a result, it was entirely impermissible for the sentencing Judge to have regard to the existence of a standard non-parole period for these offences. I agree with Macfarlan JA that the sentencing Judge had (at least) indirect regard to the existence of the standard non-parole period for these offences. With respect, the only safe course which his Honour could take was to observe that the standard non-parole periods had no application to these offences. To move beyond that, in the manner which his Honour did, led to error in imposition of sentence. 
     
      
    61 This case involves most serious examples of offences under s.61J and s.61M(2) Crimes Act 1900, committed against the same victim between February 2001 and November 2002. 
     
      
    62 As Macfarlan JA has noted at [43], the submissions on behalf of the Appellant accepted that the effect of the decision in R v AEM [2002] NSWCCA 58 was that past sentences for offences under s.61J Crimes Act 1900 had been too lenient, and that an upward movement in sentences was appropriate. This was the state of sentencing law before the commencement of the standard non-parole period system. 
     
      
    63 I agree with Macfarlan JA that error has been established with respect to sentence in accordance with the first ground of appeal on sentence. I am satisfied that some lesser sentence is warranted in law and ought be passed: s.6(3) Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
     
      
    64 However, the sentences to be imposed upon the Appellant for these most serious crimes must be substantial. In my view, an effective non-parole period of nine years represents the minimum term of imprisonment which the Appellant should serve for these objectively serious crimes: R v Simpson [2001] NSWCCA 534; 53 NSWLR 704 at 716-717 [55]-[58]. 
     
      
    65 I agree with the orders proposed by Macfarlan JA.

       Peter Todd Garay 
       
       
       
      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender, Peter Todd Garay, stands for sentence after being found guilty of contempt of court. On 10 November 2009 I published a judgment in which I found established 9 charges of contempt, being breaches of orders made by Grove J in November 2003: Commissioner for Fair Trading v Garay & Ors [2009] NSWSC 1196. Those orders and the background to the proceedings before me are to be found in that judgment at [1] – [25]. 
     
      
    2 The facts giving rise to the 9 charges which I found proved are set out in the judgment, and need not be repeated. They relate to the offender’s dealings with the owners of three properties in the Hunter area. In each case I found him guilty of 3 charges: 
     
      
       
        
         
          representing himself, expressly or impliedly, as the holder of a licence under the  
         Home Building Act 
         ; 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          contracting, by himself and in association with his father-in-law, Lindsay McGoldrick, to undertake residential building work; 
         
        
       
       
        
         
          undertaking residential building work, again in association with Mr McGoldrick. 
         
        
       
       
      In respect of each charge, I was satisfied that his conduct was, to his knowledge, in breach of one or other of the orders of Grove J.  
       
      
    3 The charges of which he was found guilty relating to the Van Der Linden property, charges 2 - 4 in the statement of charges, arise from events between mid June and early July 2007. The facts are to be found at [26] – [45] of my judgment. The charges relating to the Uebergang property, charges 6 – 8, arise from dealings in July 2007, and the facts are to be found at [46] – [59]. The charges relating to the Challinor property, charges 10 – 12, arise from events between February and April 2008, and the facts are set out at [60] – [94]. 
     
      
    4 The offender was aged between 37 and 38 at the time of the offences, and is now 40. He has previously been in contempt of court, a matter to which I shall turn in a moment. Otherwise, he has a criminal history which would usually be seen as relatively minor. However, it includes a conviction for an offence of dishonesty and more than one entry for driving whilst disqualified, an offence which also involves disobeying a court order.  
     
      
    5 In 2004, in the Federal Court of Australia, the offender was found guilty of contempt by Bennett J because of breaches of an order made the previous year by Hely J relating to his business as a turf supplier. It is unnecessary for present purposes to examine the facts of that matter. Bennett J sentenced him to imprisonment for 2 months, but ordered that the commitment warrant lie in the registry for 12 months upon his providing certain undertakings: Buchanan Turf Supplies Pty Ltd v Premier Turf Supplies [2004] FCA 1694.  
     
      
    6 More importantly, on 13 June 2005 the offender was dealt with by Buddin J after he pleaded guilty to 8 charges of contempt, arising from breaches of the same orders of Grove J with which the present proceedings are concerned: Commissioner for Fair Trading v Garay & Ors [2005] NSWSC 647. His Honour sentenced him to terms of imprisonment aggregating 16 months, with a non-parole period of 12 months, to be served by way of periodic detention. Again, it is unnecessary to detail the facts of those offences. It is sufficient to say that they involve breaches of the orders broadly similar to those for which he now stands for sentence. They arose from his dealings with the owners of eight properties over a period between late 2003 and mid 2004. His Honour described those offences as “most serious”, noting that the breaches of the orders were wilful and that the offender’s conduct was “deliberate and clearly designed to thwart the orders of the Court”: at [45]. 
     
      
    7 The offender was educated to School Certificate standard. In his mid twenties he commenced a turf supply business, which over the ensuing years became successful and profitable.  
     
      
    8 He is married and is the father of four children, one of them from a previous relationship. They range in age from 5 to 18. Because of the present offences, and against the background of his previous offending, the marriage has broken down and he currently lives with his sister. He maintains a professional relationship only with his wife, who conducts a turfing and gardening business for which he acts as a salesman. He gave evidence that he has lost contact with his children, a fact which he attributes to his own behaviour.  
     
      
    9 In his mid teenage years he took to gambling on horse and dog racing, and this developed into an addiction. As his turf supply business grew, he was in a position to gamble substantial sums of money. It appears that it has been his gambling and his related depressive illness which have led to his offending behaviour. There was evidence to that effect before Bennett J and Buddin J.  
     
      
    10 I have a report of Mr Steve Henkelman, psychologist, whose previous experience includes working for 5 years as a Probation and Parole officer. The offender revealed to Mr Henkelman that he had been adopted, a fact of which he became aware at the age of 15. He still does not know the identity of his natural parents. He described this discovery as “a life altering and shattering experience”. He attributed to it a decline in his lifestyle and behaviour, including his addictive gambling. This, he said, was exacerbated by the separation and subsequent divorce of his parents when he was 18 years old, in circumstances which he found distressing. He remained with his mother, and assumed much of the responsibility for her support.  
     
      
    11 In the proceedings before Bennett J there had been a psychological report, and there was a psychiatric report before Buddin J. Apart from a bare reference in the psychiatric report to the divorce of his parents, these personal revelations were not to be found in either report. In particular, there was no suggestion that his gambling problem may have had its origin in the distress caused by his discovery that he was adopted. He told Mr Henkelman that he had never before discussed the impact of his adoptive status with anyone, and the effect of what he said was that his parents’ divorce had been particularly devastating to him because it compounded a pre-existing psychological vulnerability created by his discovery of that status. 
     
      
    12 In discussing the offences with Mr Henkelman, he acknowledged that he was motivated by an insatiable “greed” and a desire to earn more money to feed his gambling habit. His behaviour had resulted in substantial financial losses over many years but this, it seems, had not provided him with sufficient incentive to address his unlawful behaviour.  
     
      
    13 The author of the psychological report in the proceedings before Bennett J, Dr Delahunty, suggested that he should go onto a plan of controlled gambling to wean him off his addiction. In the report, of May 2004, she recorded that he told her that he had complied with this regime for about a week and was “over gambling”. She reported that her impression was that “he is not yet ready to take the necessary steps to address his mental health and lifestyle issues.” In evidence before me, he admitted that he had lied when he suggested to her that his gambling was under control. 
     
      
    14 He told the psychiatrist whose report of January 2005 was before Buddin J, Dr Vickery, that he had been a compulsive gambler but had “stopped completely” about four months previously after his wife delivered him an ultimatum. In evidence before Buddin J, he said that he retained the urge to gamble but had not done so since September 2004 because his wife had threatened to leave him and take the children with her if he did: see his Honour’s judgment at [43].  
     
      
    15 He also told his Honour in evidence that he had terminated counselling with Dr Delahunty because he decided that he just had to “have the will to stop doing it”. Nevertheless, his gambling continued. In evidence before me, he said that he realised that he could not control his addiction without professional assistance. He started to attend Gamblers Anonymous shortly after he and his wife separated, and he has been attending meetings regularly for the past six months. 
     
      
    16 Mr Henkelman observed that in the past the offender had shown no “sign of real remorse or desire to change his behaviour due to his ongoing and persistent gambling”. His impression at the time he saw him, however, was that he did wish to deal with the “underlying psychological issues” leading to the gambling problem. In particular, he expressed himself to be willing to undergo intensive counselling to deal with the issues relating to his adoption and his feelings about his parents’ divorce.  
     
      
    17 Mr Henkelman saw him as a “broken man”, and said of him: 
     
      
       
        
        “My assessment as a result of Mr Garay’s presentation to me today is that he is at a genuine point of wanting to make changes in his life so that he never has contact with the law again and so that he can go on to be the husband and father he should always have been.” 
        
       
       
      By way of treatment, he recommended that the offender should attend counselling sessions with him on a weekly basis for at least six months, and he proposed referring him to a psychiatrist at a regional hospital for a review of his depressive condition and the prescription of his medication. He also recommended that he should continue attendance at Gamblers Anonymous, and should be referred to Salvation Army Adoption Services to make contact with his birth parents.  
       
      
    18 In his evidence before me, the offender expressed his remorse for these offences. I have received a pre-sentence report, from which it appears that he told its author that he was not guilty of any of the offences. However, in evidence he acknowledged that that was not the truth. That said, the genuineness of his remorse and of his acknowledgement of guilt is questionable. In some of the answers he provided in cross-examination he appeared not to accept the mental element which I found established in relation to each of those charges, that is, that he was knowingly in breach of the orders of Grove J. What this evidence conveyed to me was that he accepted that he had been found guilty, but was still unwilling or unable to acknowledge the extent of his criminality. Nevertheless, when it was put to him that he understood “full well” that the orders prevented him from doing what he did, he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “I probably did … I was looking for every way to get around them Court orders. I had a gambling addiction and that many debts piling up around me, I was looking for every way that I could get a dollar.” 
        
       
      
    19 He expressed a determination to rehabilitate himself and avoid further offending, saying that his behaviour had been “unacceptable” and adding, “I just need to tidy me act up and whatever happens to me happens to me and I can move on and be a better person hopefully because of this.” He said that his situation “really hit home” because he had absolutely nothing and his children, to whom he had caused embarrassment, had gone because of his “selfish” acts. He said, “I am at the bottom and I really don’t think that I can get any lower than how I feel today.”  
     
      
    20 This evidence, sincere as it may sound, calls for some scrutiny. He had assured both Bennett J and Buddin J that he would not re-offfend. In evidence before Bennett J, he said that he was sorry and “I just want to start again and hopefully today we can move forward.” He gave evidence before Buddin J that there was “no chance” of his being again in breach of Grove J’s orders. He told his Honour that the debts he had incurred through his gambling and the legal proceedings had required him to sell the family home, and that he did not think he could “ever repay” his children for what he had done. In cross-examination before me, he agreed that the effect of what he told Buddin J was that he had “hit rock bottom”. 
     
      
    21 Moreover, he gave evidence before Buddin J of an arrangement with his father-in-law, then a licensed builder. He said that when Mr McGoldrick was engaged for residential building work, he would normally be brought in to do the turf work and supply the material. He assured his Honour that Mr McGoldrick contracted directly with the owners of the property, and that that had nothing to do with him. He added that if he was unsure whether he was entitled to do any work consistently with Grove J’s orders, he would consult Mr Kevin Michaelis, an investigator with the Office of Fair Trading in the relevant area. This, of course, is the very material upon which he relied, unsuccessfully, in the proceedings before me.  
     
      
    22 In the light of all this, Mr Sarginson, for the Commissioner, submitted that I should reject the offender’s claim, yet again, that he is genuinely remorseful and has reached a turning point in his life such that he is committed to reform. Mr Sarginson’s position was that I should see him as a persistent and unrepentant offender. He also argued that I should be sceptical about his evidence concerning the relationship between his gambling problem and his discovery that he was adopted, together with the anxiety resulting from his parents’ divorce. As I understand it, Mr Sarginson accepted that he had endured those personal problems during his teenage years but argued that I should not accept his claim, made for the first time, that they led to the onset and development of his addiction. He submitted that this claim, and the offender’s attendance at Gamblers Anonymous meetings, were simply devices to enable him to make out a different case from that which he had presented to Buddin J. 
     
      
    23 There is considerable force in these arguments, and I have given them careful consideration. On the whole of the evidence, I am sceptical about the offender’s claim to be remorseful and I am guarded about his prospect of rehabilitation. Nevertheless, I think there is some prospect, particularly after a period of conditional liberty subject to supervision and appropriate treatment for his depression and his gambling problem. Not without some hesitation, I accept that there is a connection between his gambling and the discovery that he was adopted and the effect upon him of the breakdown of his parents’ marriage. He has been consistent in his account that his pattern of gambling dates from his teenage years, and I find it plausible that the onset of an addiction in one so young was the product of a serious emotional problem of some kind.  
     
      
    24 His contact with Gamblers Anonymous is a significant step forward, even if it was motivated primarily by the need to present a favourable case on sentence. With the breakdown of his marriage and his compromised relationship with his children, his personal life is in a parlous state. In these circumstances, Mr Henkelman has proposed a regime of counselling and treatment which I accept as realistic and appropriate.  
     
      
    25 In these sentence proceedings the offender was represented by Mr Hughes of counsel, who made out the best case he could in the face of considerable difficulties. Realistically, he acknowledged that custodial sentences must be imposed. However, he argued that it still would be appropriate to direct any sentence to be served by way of periodic detention or, perhaps, home detention. However, I accept Mr Sarginson’s submission that neither of those options could now be justified, and that a full time custodial sentence must be imposed.  
     
      
    26 These offences amounted to calculated breaches of the orders of Grove J by an offender who could have been in no doubt about the effect of those orders. The approach to sentencing for contempt of court is well established and does not need to be repeated here. I gratefully adopt the succinct summary of relevant authority by Buddin J in his judgment at [46] – [48]. The offender’s history of defiance of court orders emphasises the need on this occasion for particular weight to be given to considerations of retribution and deterrence, both general and personal: Veen v The Queen [No. 2] (1987 – 88) 164 CLR 465 at 477.  
     
      
    27 I am mindful that this will be his first experience of prison. In the light of his personal situation and his need for treatment and counselling, I find special circumstances warranting a departure from the statutory proportion between sentence and non-parole period. This will be reflected in the sentences for the offences relating to the Challinor property, and in the aggregate sentence. 
     
      
    28 I had contemplated passing partly cumulative sentences for the 9 offences, in recognition of the fact that they were committed in relation to three different properties over a significant period of time. However, in recognition of the consideration of totality, I have decided that that course would be unnecessary and artificial. For the offences relating to the Van Der Linden and Uebergang properties I shall pass concurrent fixed terms of imprisonment, roughly equivalent to the non-parole period which would otherwise have been appropriate. For the offences relating to the Challinor property I shall pass concurrent sentences with a non-parole period. The aggregate sentence will be imprisonment for 18 months with a non-parole period of 6 months. 
     
      
    29 Peter Todd Garay, for each of the offences relating to the Van Der Linden and Uebergang properties, charges 2 – 4 and 6 – 8 respectively in the statement of charges, you are sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months, to commence today and to expire on 24 September 2010. For each of the offences relating to the Challinor property, charges 10 – 12, you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 6 months, also to commence today and to expire on 24 September 2010, and a balance of term of 12 months, to commence on 25 September 2010 and to expire on 24 September 2011. I direct that you be released on parole on 24 September 2010.

      2009/4666 - R v MORONI TONGAHAI 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: Moroni Tongahai (the offender) is to be sentenced following his conviction by a jury of two offences, both of which occurred during the course of an incident in Churchill’s Sports Bar in Kingsford on 26 April 2008. He was convicted of the murder of Solomon Penitani (the deceased) and with assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Jordan Buchanan. The maximum penalty for the offence of murder is life imprisonment and a standard non-parole period of 20 years imprisonment is applicable to it. A maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment applies in relation to the offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm.  
     
      
    2 Prior to the offender’s trial I sentenced another man, Jason Papallo, who pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact to the murder of the deceased. An offence of affray was taken into account when Mr Papallo was sentenced. It is common ground that the sentence imposed upon Mr Papallo has no relevance to the present proceedings. 
     
      
    3 It is now my task to determine the facts in accordance with the jury’s verdict. For the most part, there is little dispute about the facts. That is because the fatal incident was captured by CCTV cameras which were in operation at the time in the premises at Churchill’s. In essence what the footage displayed was that at about 4.05 am on the morning in question the offender produced a gun and fired it three times at the deceased, who was unarmed, from close range. Two of the bullets entered the deceased’s body with fatal consequences. The post-mortem examination revealed that the first bullet entered the deceased’s left shoulder and went through the left lung, the aorta, and the right lung before terminating in the right side of his chest. The second bullet entered the outside of the deceased’s left arm and exited the inner part of his left arm before re-entering the left side of his lower chest. It then travelled through the upper abdomen before terminating in the right side of his chest.  
     
      
    4 As I have said, the events which culminated in the shooting of the deceased were captured by CCTV cameras although of course, there was no accompanying sound. A number of patrons, as well as bar staff, gave evidence concerning their observations of what occurred in the premises during the relevant timeframe. However, that body of evidence did not add anything of any particular significance to what was displayed in the footage from the CCTV cameras. 
     
      
    5 The offender and the deceased had been acquainted with one another for some time prior to the fatal incident. The evidence concerning the nature of their relationship came, for the most part, from the offender. The offender gave evidence at the trial that he had first become aware of the deceased, who was some years older than him, when he was growing up. According to the offender, the deceased was the leader of a local group of boys in the Matraville area. The offender gave evidence that he admired the deceased and related how, in due course, he became friendly with him. He also said that he managed to ingratiate himself with the group of people with whom the deceased mixed. Social contact between them entailed, as I understand it, regular attendances at the Matraville Hotel and other establishments at which alcohol was consumed. 
     
      
    6 According to the offender, his relationship with the deceased deteriorated following an incident which occurred outside the Endeavour Hotel several years before the fatal incident. In short, the offender who was about 20 at the time, asserted that he was struck to the head by the deceased for no reason which was apparent to him. He maintained that he was forced to the ground where he was then kicked repeatedly. He said that he sustained various injuries as a result of the attack upon him. Although he sought medical attention in respect of those injuries, he said that he did not report the matter to police.  
     
      
    7 The offender gave evidence that from that point in time he entertained real fears that the deceased would harm him again. He said that accordingly he took steps to avoid him. Some support for the offender’s evidence was provided by Paul Stewart who knew both him and the deceased. Mr Stewart gave evidence of an occasion on which he had been confronted by the deceased at a convenience store in Matraville. He said that the deceased had held a gun to his head and had demanded to be informed of the offender’s whereabouts. In due course Mr Stewart advised the offender of that encounter. 
     
      
    8 Michelle Wilson, who was the offender’s de facto partner during the period from January 2005 until just before the fatal incident, gave evidence of her observations of the extent to which the offender entertained fears about the deceased. She gave evidence of an occasion on which she and the offender had been travelling on a bus which had gone past Churchill’s, an event that had prompted the offender to try to hide himself once he had seen the deceased. She also gave evidence of the offender’s state of anxiety when she and he had seen the deceased whilst they were in the Eastgardens shopping complex and of the offender’s reluctance to go into the bottleshop of the Matraville Hotel out of concern that he may be seen there by the deceased. She also confirmed evidence given by the offender that they had moved to her mother’s place at Berowra in order to avoid coming into contact with the deceased. Ms Wilson, who is employed as a financial services auditor with KPMG, was an impressive witness and I have little hesitation in accepting her evidence. I am also disposed to accept the broad thrust of the offender’s evidence in respect of this aspect of the matter and particularly where it was supported by other witnesses.  
     
      
    9 The offender also gave evidence that he was aware of the deceased’s reputation for violence. Furthermore, evidence was adduced which clearly demonstrated that the deceased had a number of convictions for offences of that nature. As I understand it, those offences had frequently been committed in the context of disputes which had occurred at drinking establishments. Indeed at the time of his death the deceased was on bail for matters of such a character. 
     
      
    10 Coming then to the events of the evening in question, the evidence revealed that the deceased had been in Churchill’s for sometime prior to the offender arriving at the premises. The evidence indicated that the deceased had a blood alcohol reading of 0.192 and that he had spent much of the previous day, which was Anzac Day, consuming alcohol. The deceased was seated at a table in the lounge area of the premises with a friend of his named Isaac Tautaiolefua. The offender arrived shortly before 4 am and approached the table where he began speaking with Mr Tautaiolefua. The offender gave evidence, which appears not to be in issue, that he did not know that the deceased would be in the premises at the time. Indeed, his evidence was that he had gone to the premises for the express purpose of confronting Mr Tautaiolefua whom, he asserted, owed him money. I should indicate that other evidence in the case provides support for that aspect of his evidence. The offender said that he had become aware that Mr Tautaiolefua was at the premises when he was telephoned by Jason Papallo who informed him that Mr Tautaiolefua, and indeed other people, were at Churchill’s. Jason Papallo corroborated that part of the offender’s version of events when he gave evidence. In the circumstances I am disposed to accept it. The evidence also reveals that the offender, together with Papallo and another friend named Phillip Pace, had been drinking together at various establishments earlier in the evening.  
     
      
    11 The offender gave evidence that some months prior to the fatal incident he had lent Mr Tautaiolefua the sum of $1000. He maintained that he had made several unsuccessful attempts to recover the loan and had formed the view that Mr Tautaiolefua was seeking to avoid him. When he gave evidence, Mr Tautaiolefua confirmed that he owed the money and that he was indeed trying to avoid the offender. The offender said that he went to Churchill’s because he saw it as the perfect opportunity to confront Mr Tautaiolefua and get his money back. He said that prior to arriving at the premises he had obtained the gun, which was subsequently used to shoot the deceased, from a friend. He explained that his purpose in doing so was to show it to Mr Tautaiolefua in order to demonstrate to him that he was serious in seeking repayment of the money.  
     
      
    12 Once the offender arrived at the table at which the deceased and Mr Tautaiolefua were seated, he invited Mr Tautaiolefua outside onto the smoking terrace. He said that he did so in order that he could discuss with him the repayment of the debt. He said that once they got there, they proceeded to have a verbal altercation. The evidence reveals that the deceased followed the pair onto the smoking terrace and involved himself in the discussion although it clearly had nothing to do with him. Mr Tautaiolefua gave evidence that the deceased told the offender that he should pick on someone his own size. At some stage the offender revealed that he had a gun in his possession. It is clear from the CCTV footage that the deceased continued to involve himself in the discussion even after the gun had been produced by the offender. At some stage, security guards and other patrons appeared on the terrace. In due course those patrons returned to the main bar area. 
     
      
    13 The incident on the smoking terrace, whilst not involving any physical altercation, nonetheless created a degree of tension. Although it is not entirely clear what led the incident to turn into a physical encounter, it is quite apparent that within a short space of time a full-scale brawl had erupted. Various of the patrons got involved in jostling, pushing and gesturing at one another. Insults were traded and invitations to go outside the premises in order to continue the fight were extended. Punches were exchanged and chairs and tables were knocked over. The brawl spilt over from one part of the premises to another. The deceased and Pace were undoubtedly the most prominent protagonists in the fight. At one stage they removed their shirts and shaped up to one other. Papallo also got involved in that fight and during the course of the struggle between the three of them, the deceased was forced to the ground. 
     
      
    14 The offender left the premises after the initial exchange on the smoking terrace. He gave evidence that he did so because he was concerned that police may be called to the premises and that he did not want to be found in possession of a loaded gun. Nevertheless he returned to the premises shortly thereafter. He gave evidence that he decided to do so having observed, from a position outside the premises, that the fight was in progress. He said that he believed that he needed to go to the assistance of his friends Pace and Papallo who were, as he assessed the situation, under threat. Despite the assistance of the CCTV footage, it is not possible to form an entirely clear view as to precisely what happened, or the sequence in which events occurred, from that point in time. That is in part because the incident was captured by a number of different cameras placed at different positions within the premises which resulted in there being a number of different camera angles. Nor is there available a frame-by-frame depiction in neat chronological order of precisely what took place. In any event, it is not necessary for present purposes to provide a precise analysis of each and every aspect of the incident. It suffices to record that at certain times during the brawl, the offender and the deceased can be seen gesticulating at one another, albeit on occasions from a distance. Furthermore, it is not in issue that just prior to the fatal incident, the offender threw a beer bottle which struck the deceased in the face. It is also tolerably clear that shortly thereafter the offender advanced towards the deceased, and opened fire upon him causing him to collapse to the ground. The offender gave evidence that his eyes were closed when he fired the fatal shots and that he had not intended to kill the deceased. 
     
      
    15 The offender gave evidence that immediately prior to shooting the deceased, he had again gone to walk away from the scene when he had heard the deceased say in Tongan (which I understand to be his native tongue) that he wanted to kill him as well as saying something which the offender construed as being a threat about his girlfriend. The offender went on to say that he had heard a bang and that he had seen the deceased pointing at him. He said that he thought that the deceased may also have had a gun, but after having viewed the CCTV footage, he accepted that he was mistaken in that belief. It was upon the basis of this material, and the evidence concerning the fears which the offender otherwise entertained about the deceased, that the jury was directed to consider the issues of self-defence and/or defence of another or others or, in the alternative, excessive self-defence. Clearly enough the jury rejected the critical aspects of the offender’s evidence concerning his state of mind at the time of the fatal incident. It follows that the jury was also satisfied to the requisite standard that the Crown had excluded both of those possible “defences” as well as the issue of provocation, although it is fair to say that that issue received almost no attention from the parties during the course of final submissions. That was presumably because the evidence which was adduced from the offender did not go so far as to suggest that he had actually lost his self control. 
     
      
    16 As the offender left the bar area and approached the gaming machine area, he was pursued by a young woman named Jordan Buchanan. Even though he was still holding the gun, she jumped on his back and held him around the neck. During the course of the struggle between them, the offender struck Ms Buchanan around the area of her head causing multiple small abrasions to her face and hands. He gave evidence that his intention was purely to “fend her off” although his actions had the effect of forcing her to the ground. Jason Papallo then joined in and pulled Ms Buchanan away from the offender. Ms Buchanan’s friend, Claire Small, came to her aid. During the course of the struggle, the shoulder strap of the bag which the offender was carrying broke, causing it to fall to the ground. Once again the jury clearly accepted that the Crown had established to the requisite standard that the offender was not acting in self-defence when he struck Ms Buchanan. I am unable however to conclude that the offender struck her with the gun when he assaulted her. Jason Papallo subsequently returned to the gaming area in order to retrieve the offender’s bag which he then returned to him.  
     
      
    17 The offender gave evidence that he had consumed 10 schooners of beer and 2 or 3 “shots” of bourbon, as well as a Xanax tablet, in the period leading up to the fatal incident. Nonetheless he described himself as being “tipsy” but otherwise “in charge of” himself. The offender told Ms Anna Robilliard, a clinical psychologist who prepared a report on his behalf, that on the evening of the offence, as well as having consumed 10 schooners of beer and six bourbons, he had also take an ounce of cocaine and two Xanax tablets. He told Ms Robilliard that he was in “an intoxicated condition” when he had gone to Churchill’s Sports Bar and that he had been drinking heavily in the preceding fortnight following the break-up of his relationship with Ms Wilson.  
     
      
    18 The offender was arrested by police when he attended a police station on 29 April in the presence of his solicitor. He declined to be interviewed. It is common ground that it is appropriate that the sentences which are to be imposed should commence on that date. 
     
      
    19 The offender was born in 1981 on the Pacific Island of Niue and was 26 at the time that he committed these offences. As I have said the offender gave evidence during the course of the trial. I was provided with additional information about his background by Ms Robilliard in her report which was prepared for the purposes of sentencing. He was raised in Niue by his maternal grandparents until the age of seven at which time he was brought to Australia by his parents who settled in Matraville. He has four younger siblings. The offender’s father was a heavy drinker, and during his formative years, the offender said that he was subjected to considerable violence by his father. He attended high school in the Mount Druitt area until the end of Year 11. Since leaving school the offender has apparently always been in full-time employment. In his youth he was a promising rugby league player but his career stalled when he became involved in the excessive consumption of alcohol and illicit drugs. In the period prior to committing these offences, the offender began using steroids on a regular basis. They apparently made him “very moody”.  
     
      
    20 Ms Robilliard offered the following opinion about the offender: 
     
      
       
        
        [He] has a well entrenched Substance Dependence Disorder and a history of conduct that evidences Antisocial Personality Disorder. This implies capacity for impulsive and violent behaviour which would be exacerbated when he was intoxicated. His impulsiveness may also be related to adult symptoms of Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity (ADHD) although this has never been formally diagnosed. His antisocial disposition has been shaped by long term exposure to violent abuse during formative years. This appears to have produced co-morbid symptoms of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (Chronic) which can result in consequent aggressiveness in some individuals and heightened sensitivity to perceived threat. 
        
       
      
    21 A number of testimonials were tendered on the offender’s behalf. They were from his mother, from his aunt, from Ms Wilson and her mother and from a minister of the Uniting Church. In general terms, they attest to the offender’s personal qualities and to the fact that each of those persons will continue to provide support to the offender. It suffices to say that none of those persons can reconcile the enormity of the offender’s criminality with the man that they know. I have paid due regard to that material. 
     
      
    22 The offender read a letter to the court in which he expressed his regret for the suffering which his actions had occasioned the deceased’s family. He re-iterated that he had not intended to take the deceased’s life and apologised to his family for his “foolish, senseless mistake and for the heartache and misery that [he had] caused” to them. Ms Robilliard also described the offender as being remorseful.  
     
      
    23 The offender has a criminal record which commenced in 2000 when he appeared before the Children’s Court and was ordered to perform 150 hours of community service in respect of an offence of maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm. At the same time he was also placed on probation in respect of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In April 2002 he was fined $100 in the Local Court for using offensive language. In October the same year he was fined a total of $2400 in the Local Court in respect of two counts of common assault and a further offence of using offensive language. In 2003 he was fined $1200 and ordered to perform 200 hours of community service in the Local Court in respect of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In 2004 he was placed on a bond in the Local Court in respect of an offence of assaulting an officer in the execution of duty. At the same time he was also dealt with by way of fines and disqualification in respect of two offences of driving with low range PCA, driving whilst unlicensed and driving in a manner dangerous. In 2007 he was sentenced in the Local Court to a term of 18 months imprisonment in respect of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm whilst in the company of others. On appeal to the District Court the non-parole period which had been imposed in respect of that offence was reduced from 10 months to 8 months. The offender was released on 29 November 2007 and accordingly was at liberty on parole when he committed the present offences. Parole was revoked following his arrest for the present matters. That period expired on 2 October 2008. I have been provided with the facts surrounding the offence committed in 2007 together with a report prepared by a clinical psychologist which was tendered during the course of the sentence proceedings in respect of that offence. That offence involved an assault upon a person who had been walking down a city street in the early hours of the morning. The offender, whilst very intoxicated, apparently took exception to a remark made by the victim whereupon he proceeded to hit him in the head with his forearm occasioning to him facial injuries. The force of the blow caused the victim to fall to the ground whereupon he was kicked in the head by a co-offender. 
     
      
    24 I have received victim impact statements from the deceased’s wife and from his brother. The feelings which they have so eloquently and poignantly expressed and the grief which they and their families have suffered is entirely understandable. It is a tragedy that the deceased’s four young children have been deprived of their father’s love and support. It is quite impossible to adequately summarise that sense of loss in a few sentences and to do so, or to attempt to do so, would detract from the contents of their statements. Clearly no sentence which any court could impose can ever begin to make good that loss. I extend to the family and friends of the deceased my deepest sympathy. The approach of a sentencing judge to statements of this kind is nevertheless now well settled: see R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76; R v FD & JD (2006) 160 A Crim R 392; MAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 226. 
     
      
    25 In approaching the task of sentencing the offender, I must have regard to the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act). I must also pay due regard to the various aggravating and mitigating factors identified in s 21A of the Act which have particular relevance to the case. 
     
      
    26 As I observed earlier, the offence of murder attracts the operation of s 54A of the Act. Section 54A(2) provides that “the standard non-parole period represents the non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness”. In approaching this aspect of the matter, I have had regard to the principles set out in R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 especially at pars 117-124; 131. See also R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575 per Simpson J at par 13; The Queen v MLP (2006) 164 A Crim R 93; DPP v RHB (2008) 189 A Crim R 178. 
     
      
    27 The Crown submitted that the offence fell into the “middle of the range of objective seriousness”. My task in making an assessment of the objective seriousness of the offence is assisted by the fact that, as I have said, CCTV footage captured the most significant features of the events which culminated in the fatal incident. In essence they provide no support for the contention that either the offender or his friends were in any real danger from the deceased, or at least not during the period which immediately preceded the firing of the fatal shots. On that score it is also apparent, as the offender conceded in cross-examination, that he did not avail himself of a number of opportunities which arose for him to depart from the scene. Indeed, the evidence suggests that he ignored several requests by security staff to leave the premises. No doubt the jury was sceptical of the offender’s claim that he entertained fears of the deceased at the relevant time, particularly given that he was carrying a loaded gun and that the deceased was unarmed. As I have already said, the offender was not aware that the deceased would be at the premises. Nevertheless, his criminality is marked out by the fact that he made the totally irresponsible decision to attend there with a loaded gun, when it must have been plainly obvious to him that there would be other members of the public in attendance. Although it is pertinent to observe that most murders are committed by a person using a weapon, it remains a matter of aggravation that the offender resorted to using the gun. Moreover, it is evident that the offender, in firing the gun in the circumstances in which he did, had scant regard for the safety of other patrons. 
     
      
    28 It was submitted by Mr Sutherland SC, who appeared on behalf of the offender, that I should find that the offender intended to do no more than to inflict grievous bodily harm upon the deceased. I am unable to accept that submission in light of the medical evidence, to which I referred earlier, and what the CCTV footage reveals about the offender’s actions in shooting the deceased. Although I am of the view that it does not make a great deal of difference in the circumstances of the present case, I am nevertheless satisfied to the requisite standard that he intended to kill the deceased when he fired three shots at him from close range. However, the evidence does not permit me to conclude that that intention was formed at any time other than immediately before the shots were fired. Putting the matter another way the offender’s actions were, as the Crown conceded, spontaneous and impulsive rather than premeditated. It may also be accepted that the CCTV footage rather suggests that the offender turned away from the deceased immediately prior to the fatal incident. Something however prompted him to turn back. I am left unable to determine what may have caused him to do so. Whatever it was, it is conceivable that the offender simply reacted in a state of panic to the highly charged situation in which he found himself. I am also prepared to accept that the offender’s fears, which derived from his past encounters with the deceased, played their part in inducing him to react as he did. In those circumstances I am inclined to accept the submission, as it was ultimately refined by Mr Sutherland, that I should find that the offence falls below, but only slightly below, the middle of the range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    29 In assessing the appropriate sentence to be imposed I must also have regard, as an aggravating feature, to the fact that the offender was on parole at the time that he committed these offences. Moreover, the extent and nature of his criminal antecedents demonstrate, to my mind, a continuing “attitude of disobedience to the law” such as to require at least some additional weight being paid to considerations of personal deterrence, retribution and protection of society: see Veen v The Queen (No2) (1988) 164 CLR 465. In approaching that aspect of the matter I have sought to apply the principles enunciated in R v McNaughton (2006) 66 NSWLR 566. That said, I acknowledge that there is nothing in the offender’s criminal history which remotely approaches the seriousness of the principal offence in respect of which he stands to be sentenced.  
     
      
    30 There is not a great deal of material of a subjective nature that can be advanced on the offender’s behalf which would serve to mitigate the otherwise appropriate sentences. Although I am prepared to accept that the offender has expressed some remorse for his actions in shooting the deceased, I am not persuaded that he fully accepts the legal consequences of his actions, or for that matter that he accepts his guilt of these offences. Although it was faintly suggested on the offender’s behalf that his actions were, at least to some extent provoked, I am not minded to ameliorate the sentence on this basis. As I have previously indicated the offender denied, whilst giving evidence, that he had lost self-control. Nor do his actions suggest that he did.  
     
      
    31 I referred earlier to the evidence concerning the offender’s consumption of alcohol on the night in question. Although the Crown pointed out that there was some minor inconsistencies in the accounts given by the offender on this topic, I do not regard it as a matter of any great moment. That is because even if the offender had been significantly intoxicated at the time, that would not be a consideration in view of his history, that could operate to mitigate the otherwise appropriate sentences. Nor in fairness, did Mr Sutherland suggest that it could. 
     
      
    32 It cannot be said, particularly given his prior criminal record, that the offender’s prospects of rehabilitation are other than fairly forlorn. It seems readily apparent that the offender has, thus far at least, been unable to curb his apparent tendency to resort to violence after having consumed excessive quantities of alcohol. I would not however be prepared to regard his prospects as completely doomed particularly as he is still a relatively young man with a creditable work record who retains the support of his family and friends. 
     
      
    33 Although the offence committed upon Jordan Buchanan occurred during the course of the same criminal episode, it nonetheless constitutes a separate offence involving a separate victim and thus requires, as Mr Sutherland recognised, the imposition of a sentence which has a degree of accumulation built into it. It is to be recalled that it occurred as the offender was fleeing from the premises as he sought to avoid being apprehended for having killed the deceased. That said, I accept that it was a highly unusual form of the offence and that the offender spontaneously reacted, albeit with a display of excessive force, to the intervention of Ms Buchanan.  
     
      
    34 The need to accumulate the sentences provides a basis for finding “special circumstances”. In the result there will be a minor departure from the normal statutory ratio which the overall non-parole period bears to the overall head sentence. The effect of the overall sentence which I shall impose will, in any event, enable the offender to have an extended period of supervision in the community whilst on parole. In setting the overall non-parole period, I have borne steadily in mind the need to fix the minimum period which the offender must spend in custody: R v Simpson (2001) 53 NSWLR 704. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    35 For the offence of assaulting Jordan Buchanan and occasioning actual bodily harm to her the offender is sentenced to a fixed term of 15 months to commence on 29 April 2008 and to expire on 28 July 2009. 
     
      
    36 For the murder of Solomon Penitani the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 18½ years imprisonment to commence on 29 October 2008 and to expire on 28 April 2027 with a total sentence of 24½ years imprisonment to expire on 28 April 2033. The total effective non-parole period is thus 19 years imprisonment and the total effective sentence is thus 25 years imprisonment. The offender will be eligible for release on parole on 28 April 2027.

    JUDGMENTSENTENCE1. I am sentencing Faiva Peckham for two crimes. One is the crime of robbery and the other is the crime of demanding money with menaces. The first is made into a crime by s 94 of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum of fourteen years imprisonment. The second is contained in s 99(1) of the same Act and it carries a maximum of ten years imprisonment.2. Briefly, what Mr Peckham did which brings him before me for sentencing is this. It was a Saturday night on 2 May 2009. Mr Peckham was in a train on its way to Seven Hills. Mr Peckham asked a man for a cigarette, which was refused because the man did not smoke. Mr Peckham became aggressive. The man left and went into another carriage. Mr Peckham went into the vestibule area of a carriage and stood next to a Mr Zilioli and asked him for a cigarette. Mr Peckham then said “Have you got a wallet. Do you want a punch in the head?”. Mr Zilioli sensibly said that he did not want any trouble, but Mr Peckham’s response was “Let’s fight.” This behaviour resulted in the charge of demanding money with menaces.3. Sensibly, Mr Zilioli got out of the way. He saw two Transit Police and let them know what was going on, but at the same time Mr Peckham bent over another man named Kurt Barnes in an intimidating manner. He put his hands down the front of his pants and said that he had a knife. He demanded that Mr Barnes produce his wallet, mobile phone and everything else and then he said “If you don’t give me your money, I’m going to pull out my knife and cut you.” Although he did not produce a knife, Mr Barnes sensibly handed over his wallet and mobile phone and a set of keys. This behaviour by Mr Peckham resulted in the charge of robbery.4. Just then the Transit Police arrived and in time to see Mr Peckham put some property back into the hands of Mr Barnes. He turned to face the police. He was put under arrest and told to sit down. At one stage when the train was stopped he stood up and charged at one of the police, who stumbled forwards, losing his balance. Luckily, he did not fall into the gap between the train and the platform. Mr Peckham ran away from the train on to the tracks and away from the scene. As a result of this action he was dealt with for escaping from police custody. That charge I am asked to deal with at a later stage.5. Mr Zilioli felt real concern for his safety and welfare and was extremely intimidated by Mr Peckham’s actions. Mr Barnes felt the same fears and was frightened of being assaulted or stabbed by Mr Peckham.6. Mr Peckham was arrested six days later on 8 May 2009 in Wellington.7. Mr Peckham has a criminal record. Although he is now twenty-three, there are no recorded offences before he became an adult in 2005. He has convictions for assaults and breaching Apprehended Violence Orders and has twice served prison sentences. He has no prior convictions for robbery or demanding money with menaces.8. I should have pointed out when I was explaining what had happened giving rise to Mr Peckham being charged is that at the time of committing this offence he was on parole. Part of the conditions of parole included dealing with an alcohol problem.9. There was tendered by the prosecutor a Pre Sentence Report dated 11 February 2010. It noted that Mr Peckham had some history with the Probation and Parole Service. It noted that he was raised in the Mount Druitt area of Sydney, as well as on an Aboriginal mission in the western New South Wales town of Wellington. He told the Service that his parents separated when he was about five and both had problems with alcohol abuse during his childhood. An aunt informed the Service that Mr Peckham’s childhood “was marred by violence, drugs and alcohol”. Mr Peckham added that his mother had gambling issues as well.10. He completed his HSC in 2004 and got good results. However, he noted that he was often suspended from school because of bad behaviour. He has worked for only about six months after he left school and then a few days a week as part of an Aboriginal youth programme in Wellington. He acknowledged to the Service his problems with alcohol and drugs, saying that he had been drinking since about the age of fourteen and heavily by the time he was eighteen. He also reported that he was using cannabis as well as amphetamines and the drug commonly known as ice on a daily basis.11. He showed some victim empathy when he talked about the offences with the probation officer and displayed some remorse as well. He has no misconduct reports so far as whilst he has been in custody.12. He referred himself to the Roy Thorne Substance Misuse Rehabilitation Centre in Moree. They apparently have confirmed that he is on their waiting list and that a bed is available. He said that he did not recall the events which gave rise to the charge. He is regarded as unsuitable for a Community Service Order and ineligible for a Periodic Detention Order.13. There was tendered by Mr Bogan, who appeared for Mr Peckham, a psychological assessment by the forensic psychologist Mr John Taylor, who noted much of the same history as the Probation and Parole officer had noted. Mr Taylor thought that he had a moderate risk of recidivism, as well as a moderate risk of violent recidivism. He thought, however, that the risk of recidivism would be significantly lower if Mr Peckham were able to resolve his substance abuse and successfully engage in anger management counselling. Mr Peckham expressed interest in undertaking Mr Taylor’s ex-inmate programme, the details of which Mr Taylor included as an appendix to his report. He would clearly, in Mr Taylor’s opinion, benefit from a drug rehabilitation programme and Mr Taylor thought he would gain benefit “if he could be placed in the Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre at Parklea as this would not only assist him with drug rehabilitation but would also be able to prepare him for entry into the community.”14. Mr Bogan called his client to give evidence. He confirmed his alcohol and drug problems and acknowledged that he had been stupid on the night that he committed these offences. He said that he did not even need the money because he had funds with him. He recalls running away after being challenged. He once again expressed his remorse and desire to apologise to the two victims of his criminal behaviour. He acknowledged his background as part of the Aboriginal mission at Wellington and the difficulties in growing up in that environment, where he was exposed to a lot of activity involving drugs and alcohol. He spent part of his time in Sydney and he is interested in playing rugby league football. He was also exposed to domestic violence in his household. He has two children and wishes to remain or at least to increase his contact with them when he is released from prison. He is using the time in prison to rehabilitate himself physically and to stay fit. He has undertaken a couple of courses whilst he is in custody.15. Mr Bogan pointed to the spontaneous nature of the crimes committed by his client, saying how he was affected by alcohol and drugs at the time so that he was exercising limited judgment. I think these observations are true. They do not excuse his offending behaviour but it shows that his behaviour can be contrasted with somebody who soberly and carefully plans the robbery of another person.16. Mr Bogan drew my attention to the factors referred to by the Supreme Court in R v Fernando and Ms Duncalf, who appeared for the prosecution, acknowledged their significance but indicated they would probably not provide much more relevance than the general personal information that we already have about Mr Peckham. Mr Bogan said that his client was motivated to improve himself. He wants to increase his relationship with his children. He is interested in sport and he wants to get some employment and stay in employment. Mr Peckham had pleaded guilty to both offences at what Ms Duncalf agreed was the earliest available opportunity.17. Mr Bogan drew my attention to the possibility of his client being referred to the Compulsory Drug Treatment Correctional Centre.18. Particularly with regard to the fact that these offences were committed on parole, I would regard an appropriate sentence for the robbery offence as three and a half years. However, Mr Peckham has pleaded guilty and should be given a twenty-five per cent discount off that sentence. I propose to do that because by pleading guilty he has made the administration of justice in the State more manageable. I would therefore, strictly speaking, reduce his sentence to thirty-one and a half months but I would round it off to two and a half years. I would fix a non parole period at seventy-five per cent in accordance with the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 of that head sentence, being twenty-two and a half months. Once again I would round it down by a few months to eighteen months. There are some special circumstances warranting a longer than normal period on parole.19. I would regard an appropriate sentence for the demand money with menaces as two and a half years imprisonment. Once again Mr Bogan has pleaded guilty, so I would discount that sentence by twenty-five per cent and reduce it to twenty-two and a half months. His non parole period should represent about seventy-five per cent of that sentence, which would be approaching seventeen months, but I would round it down to fifteen months as a non parole period.20. Accordingly, I will impose the following sentences on Mr Peckham. For the robbery offence I set a non parole period of eighteen months, to commence on 20 November 2009 and to expire on 19 May 2011. The balance of the term will be one year from 20 May 2011 to 19 May 2012. The overall term is two and a half years imprisonment.21. For the demand money with menaces I set a non parole period for the sentence of fifteen months. That will commence on 20 April 2010 and will expire on 19 July 2011. The balance of the term will be five months, commencing on 20 July 2011 and expiring on 19 December 2011.22. Just have a seat, Mr Peckham, whilst I check. Mr Hallak, Mr Kernick - first whether I have made any factual errors in what I have said or not said and, secondly, whether the mathematics are correct.HALLAK: Your Honour, the only issue I can bring up - actually I’ll withdraw that, your Honour, I’ve just recalculated it myself.HIS HONOUR: All right.HALLAK: Thank you, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: So Mr Peckham will have a sentence of two and a half years with a non parole period of twenty months overall, that is my calculation. Does that coincide with yours, Mr Hallak and Mr Kernick?KERNICK: Yes, your Honour.HALLAK: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: All right.23. I have ascertained that there are grounds on which the Drug Court might find Mr Peckham to be an eligible convicted offender and I refer Mr Peckham to the Drug Court to determine whether he should be the subject of a Compulsory Drug Treatment Order. I make that referral under s 18B of the Drug Court Act 1998.HIS HONOUR: Now I think I have to proceed to direct his release on parole, is that what I do, and fix parole conditions?HALLAK: Yes, your Honour.24. Under s 50 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 I make an order directing the release of Mr Peckham on parole on 19 July 2007. The conditions of his parole--KERNICK: Excuse me, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Did I say “2007”?KERNICK: Yes, you did, your Honour.25. Sorry - on 19 July 2011. The conditions of his parole are that he be of good behaviour, that he notify the Registrar of this Court of any change of address and that he be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service and accept any reasonable recommendations and directions an officer of that Service may make regarding drug and alcohol rehabilitation.HIS HONOUR: Now are there any other conditions of parole that either of you would suggest?HALLAK: No, your Honour.KERNICK: No, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Okay, thank you.26. Now, Mr Peckham, you have got two sentences - one for the robbery, which is two and a half years. I have backdated them to 20 November, which is when your custody on these cases started. You were not on balance of parole any more, your custody on these sentences started, do you understand, so from 20 November 2009, last year, and I fixed a non parole period of eighteen months, so that expires on 19 May next year. And then the demand money with menaces I fixed that sentence, that is twenty months, and it starts during the first sentence and the non parole period finishes on 19 July 2011. So your overall non parole period is twenty months, dating from 20 November 2009, and I have directed your release on parole on 19 July next year, okay, so you are partway through serving that, and the overall balance of parole, you will be on parole for ten months from 20 July, after you are released on parole, until 19 May the following year. Now whilst you are on parole you have got to behave yourself, you know that, because on previous occasions you have not, you have got to tell the Registrar of this Court if you change your address, and I have recommended that you be supervised by the Probation and Parole Service, who will help you. You have had dealings with them before.27. But, more significantly, I have referred you to the Drug Court to see if they can help you. They may not be able to, but one of the things, of course, is where you live or where you are going to live and you will have to talk to Mr Bogan about that. If they find that you are eligible then they might make a Compulsory Drug Treatment Order. That is out of my hands. It would be a good thing if you could go down that track because you obviously need to sort out this drug and alcohol problem that has been dogging you for most of your adult life - well most of your life as a child but now getting into an adult, and you are twenty-three now, otherwise you will just keep coming back to these Courts and, as you say, you want to provide a good role model for your children. If you start sorting yourself out now you will do just that.HIS HONOUR: I will just check if there is anything else. Yes, I am reminded by my associate. Mr Kernick, there is a Section 166 Certificate.KERNICK: Yes, the escape lawful custody.HIS HONOUR: What am I asked to do with that?KERNICK: I think the sentence, your Honour, of the other two is more than adequate to cover that as well.HIS HONOUR: And so what should I do with it - do I dismiss it, what do I do? 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act?KERNICK: Yes, Criminal Procedure Act.HIS HONOUR: Or the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure)--KERNICK: Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: That runs out at section--KERNICK: My apologies, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Yes, now is this a - let us look at the certificate. It is a related offence, it is escape from police custody.KERNICK: From memory, your Honour, it’s a guide to use when sentencing on the other two matters.HIS HONOUR: No, I think that might be if it’s a Form 1.KERNICK: Form 1, yes.HIS HONOUR: Under s 167 it says: 
     
      
      “ 
      If following a plea of guilty to an indictable offence the Court finds the accused person guilty of a related offence, the Court is, unless it considers it inappropriate in the circumstances to do so, to order that the charge in relation to each back-up offence be dismissed.” 
      
    Yes, it is to deal with any back-up offence. This is not a back-up offence.KERNICK: Your Honour, if you like if I could have five minutes to get some further information--HIS HONOUR: Yes, perhaps you had better check on that. It looks as though what you need to look at is div 7 of some part of the Criminal Procedure Act from 165 through to 169 and this is said to be, according to the Section 166 Certificate, a related offence rather than a back-up offence, so perhaps you had better have a look, and if you would let the court officer know. We have just got to sort out this escape charge, Mr Peckham. And if you let her know, she will bring Mr Peckham up and then I will come back on to the Bench or I might be here doing something else anyway and we will deal with it then, Mr Kernick and Mr Hallak.KERNICK: Yes, your Honour.HALLAK: Yes, your Honour.SHORT ADJOURNMENTHIS HONOUR: Yes, how did you go, Mr Kernick?KERNICK: I made those enquiries for you. I’ve spoken to my friend. Apparently his client has already pleaded to that matter. The options are, your Honour, is that you can finalise the matter now, that is sentence him, or refer the matter back to the Local Court.HALLAK: And I have spoken with my client in regards to those options. He’d like the matter to be dealt with today, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: Yes, I can understand that. What do you say, Mr Kernick, is an appropriate--KERNICK: Yes, the Crown’s position’s the same, your Honour, that the sentences imposed on the previous two matters are more than adequate for this one, your Honour. You do have the option - sorry, your Honour - you do have the option as well of dismissing the charge, but that’s obviously another totally--28. In addition I am sentencing Mr Peckham for a related offence, which is the subject of a certificate under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986. It is escape from police custody. The circumstances of that I have set out already when detailing the robbery and the demand money with menaces offences. It put one of the police officers in a dangerous predicament. Escaping from police in circumstances involving train stations or trains can be fraught with danger. I regard an appropriate penalty as six months imprisonment. I will make that six months imprisonment concurrent with the sentences which I have just imposed.29. Accordingly, for the offence of escape custody I sentence you to six months imprisonment, to commence on 20 November 2009 and to expire on 19 May 2010. Do I need to do anything else?KERNICK: No, your Honour.HALLAK: No, your Honour.30. All right, you have got six months for that escape. You are serving that now, and that expires on 19 May and then you finish off your other sentences, do you understand?OFFENDER: Yes, your Honour.HIS HONOUR: So that is dispensed with now, it is over and done with.OFFENDER: Thank you.HIS HONOUR: All right, Mr Peckham, good luck.OFFENDER: Yeah, thanks for that.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 SPIGELMAN CJ: I agree with Allsop P and Johnson J. 
     
      
    2 ALLSOP P and JOHNSON J: On 9 December 2009, orders were made by this Court as follows: 
     
      
       
      1. Allow the Crown appeal. 
       
       
      2. Quash the sentence imposed by the District Court on 24 April 2008. 
       
       
      3. In lieu thereof, impose a sentence of imprisonment for 18 months to commence 9 December 2009. 
       
       
      4. Order that the execution of the sentence be suspended for 18 months upon Mr Carroll entering upon a bond to be of good behaviour for a period of 18 months pursuant to s. the  
      Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 
      , s 12. 
       
       
      5. Application by Mr Carroll for leave to appeal against sentence refused. 
       
      
    3 These are our reasons for joining in the making of those orders. 
     
      
    4 On 20 May 2007, Mr Carroll, who at the time was 20 years old, head-butted a 51 year old man (Mr Luigi Criniti) outside a suburban hotel. Mr Criniti fell, hitting his head on the pavement. He died some days later of the head injury caused when he fell. Mr Carroll was charged with one count of manslaughter, that between 20 and 30 May 2007 he did unlawfully kill Mr Criniti contrary to the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 18(1)(b). The offence carried a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment: Crimes Act 1900 (NSW), s 24. 
     
      
    5 On 1 November 2007, Mr Carroll pleaded guilty in the Downing Centre Local Court and was committed for sentence in the District Court. On 24 April 2008, he was sentenced in the District Court at Sydney by Flannery DCJ to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 18 months to commence 2 May 2008 and to expire on 1 November 2009, with a balance of term of 18 months to expire on 1 May 2011. It was ordered that the sentence be served by way of periodic detention.  
     
      
    6 The Crown appealed on the sole ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
    7 On 19 September 2008, the Crown appeal was allowed by the Court of Criminal Appeal (McClellan CJ at CL and Hislop J, Simpson J dissenting): R v Carroll [2008] NSWCCA 218; 188 A Crim R 253. The sentence imposed in the District Court was quashed; and, in lieu thereof, the Court sentenced Mr Carroll to full-time imprisonment for a non-parole period of 18 months to commence 2 May 2008 and to expire on 1 November 2009, with a balance of term of 18 months to expire on 1 May 2011.  
     
      
    8 The High Court granted special leave to appeal and, on 21 April 2009, allowed the appeal, set aside the orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal and remitted the Crown appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal for re-hearing: Carroll v The Queen [2009] HCA 13; 83 ALJR 579. 
     
      
    9 On 29 April 2009, Mr Carroll was granted bail in the Supreme Court. 
     
      
    10 On 10 July 2009, the Crown appeal and an application for leave to appeal against sentence by Mr Carroll filed on 22 April 2009 were heard by a Court comprised of Allsop P, Kirby J and Johnson J. The Court reserved its decision and made, at the request of both sides, orders for the filing of further submissions by late August. These submissions were filed. 
     
      
    11 Prior to the delivery of judgment, Royal Assent was given to the bill which became the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Amendment (Double Jeopardy) Act 2009 (the “Double Jeopardy Act”) which amended the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (the “Appeal and Review Act”) by inserting s 68A in the following form: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        s 68A Double jeopardy not to be taken into account in prosecution appeals against sentence 
        
       
       
        
        (1) An appeal court must not:  
         
         
          
          (a) dismiss a prosecution appeal against sentence, or 
          
         
         
          
          (b) impose a less severe sentence on any such appeal than the court would otherwise consider appropriate,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          because of any element of double jeopardy involved in the respondent being sentenced again. 
          
         
         
        (2) This section extends to an appeal under the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
          
        and accordingly a reference in this section to an appeal court includes a reference to the Court of Criminal Appeal.” 
         
        
       
      
    12 Section 68A applied to an appeal that was commenced but not finally determined before the insertion of the section: the Appeal and Review Act, cl 16 of Part 8 Schedule 1 inserted by item [4] of the Double Jeopardy Act. Clause 16 is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Section 68A, as inserted by the  
        Crimes (Appeal and Review) Amendment (Double Jeopardy) Act 2009 
        , extends to an appeal that was commenced but not finally determined before the insertion of the section.” 
        
       
      
    13 Further submissions were filed on the effect and validity of the Double Jeopardy Act, including submissions in support of a Constitutional challenge to s 68A. Notices under the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), s 78B were given to the State, Territory and Commonwealth Attorneys-General. 
     
      
    14 A further hearing took place on 9 December 2009, before a five judge bench (Spigelman CJ, Allsop P, Kirby J, Howie J and Johnson J) in order to deal with the Constitutional issues. The parties consented to the Chief Justice and Howie J being added to the bench without re-argument of the matters dealt with in July. 
     
      
    15 The argument on 9 December 2009 took place immediately following argument in R v JW before a differently constituted bench of five judges (Spigelman CJ, Allsop P, McClellan CJ at CL, Howie J and Johnson J) in which similar arguments were propounded as to s 68A and some of the grounds of its asserted invalidity. Judgment in R v JW has been delivered. The Court was unanimous in its views as to the proper construction of s 68A and its effect: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49.  
     
      
      The proper construction of s 68A, its reach and scope and its constitutional validity 
       
      
    16 The narrow confines of s 68A were dealt with in R v JW at [49] and [141]. 
     
      
    17 Mr Game SC, who, with Ms Bashir, appeared for Mr Carroll, submitted that s 68A did not apply to this appeal because Mr Carroll’s appeal had already been “finally determined” for the purposes of cl 16 of Part 8 of Schedule 1 of the Appeal and Review Act. 
     
      
    18 We reject this submission. Before the operation of the Double Jeopardy Act and the relevant amendments to the Appeal and Review Act, the High Court had set aside this Court’s orders, thereby reviving the original orders of the sentencing judge. The “matter”, that is the appeal under the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW), had been remitted to this Court for rehearing. That appeal was not finally determined. 
     
      
    19 Mr Game next submitted that the appeal in this Court was in federal jurisdiction. That was uncontroversial in so far as that circumstance was explained by the Constitutional debate that was raised: s 76(i) of the Constitution. Mr Game submitted that the same conclusion was to be reached because of the fact that the appeal was before this Court pursuant to remitter under the Judiciary Act, s 37, which is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “[37]  
        Form of judgment on appeal 
         
         
        The High Court in the exercise of its appellate jurisdiction may affirm reverse or modify the judgment appealed from, and may give such judgment as ought to have been given in the first instance, and if the cause is not pending in the High Court may in its discretion award execution from the High Court or remit the cause to the Court from which the appeal was brought for the execution of the judgment of the High Court; and in the latter case it shall be the duty of that Court to execute the judgment of the High Court in the same manner as if it were its own judgment.” 
        
       
      
    20 The argument in this Court proceeded on the correctness of the assumption that the High Court’s order was made under s 37 and in particular under or by reference to the second part of it. No occasion arises to examine the correctness of that assumption. 
     
      
    21 It is unnecessary to examine all the consequences of the fact that the matter was returned to this Court under s 37. Other than the operation of s 76(i) here, no other provision of ss 75 and 76 of the Constitution was said to be engaged. For instance, it is difficult to conclude that the matter (that is the controversy, as distinct from the occasion for this Court to undertake its resolution and quelling) arose under the Judiciary Act, s 37. For present purposes and on the way the matter was argued, it can be accepted that the Court is executing the judgment of the High Court. 22 In this context and on the hypothesis that the Court was exercising federal jurisdiction, three principal submissions were put on behalf of Mr Carroll as to the invalidity of s 68A: first, that s 68A was inconsistent with s 37 on its face; secondly, that s 68A was inconsistent with the operation of s 37, in this case by reason of the terms of the remitter order made by the High Court; and, thirdly, that s 68A was an impermissible interference with the exercise of federal jurisdiction. The first submission was put by reference to the engagement of the Constitution, s 109, before the operation of the Judiciary Act, s 68. The first and second submissions can be understood to be put by reference to the Judiciary Act, s 68. 
     
      
       
      Whether s 68A is inconsistent with s 37 
       
      
    23 We do not consider that on its face s 68A is inconsistent with s 37. Whether or not s 68A detracts from any order made by the High Court under s 37 is another (the next) question. Section 68A neither detracts from, nor enters any field covered by, s 37. It simply states the law of New South Wales to be picked up by the Judiciary Act, s 68. Nothing in its terms is inconsistent with s 37 so as to prevent it being picked up by s 68. 
     
      
       
      Whether s 68A conflicts with or detracts from the High Court order under s 37 
       
      
    24 The question whether s 68A conflicts with or detracts from the High Court’s order depends upon a proper appreciation of the content of that order. Before the scope of the High Court’s order is examined, it should be noted that this Court in R v JW made clear that the Crown has an obligation to bring into existence (and file) a formal document identifying the grounds of appeal: R v JW at [30]. The notice of appeal filed by the Crown on 9 May 2008 only identified that the “sentence [was] manifestly inadequate”. It was with the notice of appeal in that form that the matter was dealt with by the High Court. 
     
      
    25 The High Court dealt with this and the particular arguments that were put forward at 581 [8] and [9] of their reasons as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[8] The particular principle which the Director sought to invoke in his appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against the sentence passed upon the present appellant was the last category of case identified in the well-known classification stated in  
        House v The King 
        : 
         
         
          
          ‘It may not appear how the primary judge has reached the result embodied in his order, but, if upon the facts it is unreasonable or plainly unjust, the appellate court may infer that in some way there has been a failure properly to exercise the discretion which the law reposes in the court of first instance. In such a case, although the nature of the error may not be discoverable, the exercise of the discretion is reviewed on the ground that a substantial wrong has in fact occurred.’ 
          
         
         
        The Director's allegation in his notice of appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal, that the sentence passed was ‘manifestly inadequate’, was an allegation of this kind of error. It was not an allegation that the primary judge had acted upon a wrong principle, allowed extraneous or irrelevant matters to guide or affect her, had mistaken the facts or had not taken into account some material consideration. If a case of specific error of any of those kinds was to be made it would have been necessary to identify the asserted error in the grounds of appeal. But as indicated at the outset, no case of specific error was alleged; the sole ground of appeal was manifest inadequacy of sentence. 
         
          
         
        [9] In support of that ground of appeal the Director submitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal that there were three reasons the sentence was manifestly inadequate. Those arguments were recorded 
          
        by McClellan CJ at CL as being: 
         
         
          
          (a) the primary judge ‘erred in finding that the youth of the [present appellant] and the need to foster his rehabilitation reduced the need for retribution and general deterrence’; 
          
         
         
          
          (b) the primary judge ‘gave too much weight to the [present appellant's] subjective circumstances and failed to appreciate the objective seriousness of the offence’; and 
          
         
         
          
          (c) the primary judge ‘erred in finding that there were exceptional circumstances such that a sentence of periodic detention would reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfil the manifold purposes of punishment’. 
          
         
         
          
          Although the majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal directed chief attention to the second of these matters, and in particular the issue of objective seriousness of the offence, it is as well to point out that none of the three matters identified by the Director was, or was advanced as being, an error of principle or fact such as would have enlivened any of the forms of error identified in  
          House v The King  
          other than the last category. Each of the three arguments advanced was put as no more than some explanation for what was alleged to be a sentence which, on its face, was ‘unreasonable or plainly unjust’.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    26 The High Court then examined the first judgment of this Court and said the following at 582-584 [17]-[26]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[17] McClellan CJ at CL, speaking for the majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal, concluded that the offence was serious and could not justify the description of falling towards the bottom of the range of objective seriousness. That conclusion was expressed against a characterisation of the facts that differed in important respects from that of the primary judge. In particular, McClellan CJ at CL described the facts in the following terms: 
         
         
          
          ‘Although her Honour found that the deceased made a threat to get a gun, this was an idle boast which could not have justified a violent response from the respondent. Mr Criniti was apparently intoxicated and there was no suggestion that the [present appellant] was under any immediate threat. Perhaps a dismissive word in response to Mr Criniti was justified but not a violent and aggressive act with, on any view, potentially serious physical consequences. Although a head butt delivered to another's face may not be expected to lead to death, severe injury was clearly foreseeable and death at least a possibility.’ 
           
          
         
        [18] Two features of that description are to be noted. First, while it is undeniably true that nothing the victim had said or done ‘justified a violent response’ the appellant had never suggested that what he had done was justified. The primary judge had not held to the contrary. Rather, the primary judge had taken account of the fact that the appellant had reacted (wrongly and violently, but spontaneously) to what she had described as ‘some provocation’ from the victim. 
         
         
        [19] In recording the arguments advanced to the Court of Criminal Appeal on behalf of the present appellant, McClellan CJ at CL noted that emphasis was given to the prosecution's concession at first instance that the appellant had “acted in response to the deceased's provocative act in threatening to get a gun and kill the 'whole family'. But although the prosecution's concession about  
        why  
        the appellant had acted as he had was thus noted, describing the deceased's words as ‘an idle boast’ which perhaps justified ‘a dismissive word in response’ focused attention upon the objective characterisation of the events to the exclusion of the primary judge's finding about what had led the appellant to act as he had. The objective characterisation of the events was never in issue; the subjective reason the appellant reacted to those events as he did was not irrelevant. 
         
         
        [20] The second point to notice about the Chief Judge's characterisation of the matter is his encapsulation of why, in the circumstances of this case, the offence of manslaughter was established. He said that although a head-butt delivered to another's face may not be expected to lead to death ‘severe injury was clearly foreseeable and death at least a possibility’. 
         
         
        [21] By his plea of guilty the appellant acknowledged that his head-butting the victim was an unlawful and dangerous act that carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury. He did not admit (and the trial judge did not find) that ‘ 
        severe 
         injury was clearly foreseeable’ or that ‘death [was] at least a possibility’. 
         
         
        [22] Whether what was established by the plea, and by the material led at the sentencing hearing, was sufficiently described in the words of Simpson J as ‘an act of violence that foreseeably, potentially could have led to injury to the victim’ need not be examined. It is enough to notice that by his plea the appellant admitted that his act carried with it an appreciable risk of serious injury but that he did not admit the larger proposition upon which the majority in the Court of Criminal Appeal acted. 
         
         
        [23] Whether, as Simpson J held, the appellant ‘could not have been expected to foresee that [the victim] would fall to the ground and strike his head in such a way as to cause serious injury; far less could he have been expected to foresee death’ is a matter that is better examined upon a rehearing of the Director's appeal. So too, it will be for the parties on a rehearing to debate the sufficiency and accuracy of the characterisation of the appellant's conduct adopted by Simpson J when she described it as ‘an alcohol-fuelled, foolish, possibly thuggish, spontaneous (and immature, even childish) act’ in which the appellant ‘behaved impetuously, plainly without thinking, in the face of a threat’ from the victim. 
         
         
        Conclusion and orders 
         
         
        [24] In deciding whether the sentence passed by the primary judge was manifestly inadequate it was open to the Court of Criminal Appeal to consider how the appellant's offending was properly to be characterised. In particular, it was open to the Court of Criminal Appeal to form a view different from the primary judge about where, on an objective scale of offending, the appellant's conduct stood. But in the absence of any challenge to the primary judge's findings of fact, it was not open to the Court of Criminal Appeal to evaluate the adequacy of the sentence by discarding reference to why the appellant had acted as he had, or by attributing to him the ability to foresee that his conduct could cause not just serious injury, but severe injury or the possibility of death. Both these steps being erroneous, the majority of the Court of Criminal Appeal erred in reasoning to the conclusion that the sentence passed was manifestly inadequate. The appeal to this Court must then be allowed. 
         
        
        
        [25] This Court should not decide the Director's appeal. That task is better undertaken in this case by the Court of Criminal Appeal. 
         
         
        [26] The appeal to this Court should be allowed, the orders of the Court of Criminal Appeal made on 19 September 2008 set aside, and the matter remitted to the Court of Criminal Appeal for rehearing by that Court.” 
        
       
      
    27 It is undoubted that the scope of the authority of a court to which a matter is remitted under s 37 is confined by the terms of the remitter and that such court can make no order nor undertake any task inconsistent with the remitter order: Peacock v DM Osborne & Co [1907] HCA 42; 4 CLR 1564 at 1567-1568; R v Weiss (No 2) [2006] VSCA 161; 164 A Crim R 454 at 472 [99]-[102]. 
     
      
    28 It is crucial, therefore, to understand what was remitted. The importance of this task arises at two points: first, whether compliance with s 68A is contrary to the order and so, s 37, that section being the source of power of the order; and, secondly, whether the Court has authority to permit the Crown to amend its notice of appeal to raise, as grounds of the appeal, the three arguments referred to in [9] of the High Court’s reasons, as well as three further grounds. 
     
      
    29 The order for remitter was unrestricted in terms and was of “the matter”, that is the controversy. The controversy was the complaint by the Crown about the sentence imposed by the sentencing judge. The whole of the orders of this Court had been the subject of the special leave application and the argument. All the orders of this Court were set aside. This is not a case where only one part of the intermediate court’s orders or reasons was the subject of complaint: cf R v Weiss (No 2). Whilst the High Court examined the Crown’s notice of appeal in [8] and [9] in a fashion reflecting its limited scope (an analysis similarly undertaken by the Chief Justice in R v JW) that did not confine the remitter. What was remitted was the whole matter, the controversy, for rehearing. Implicitly, that rehearing was to take place in accordance with the law then obtaining. In these terms, the task on remitter (that is the operation or execution of the task committed to this Court by s 37 and by the High Court’s order under it) would not be detracted from or affected in any way by the Court applying s 68A. Thus, it is legitimate for the Court to apply s 68A. 
     
      
    30 Further, viewing the scope of the remitter in this way makes it legitimate for the Court to entertain the application to amend the notice of appeal. No unexpressed restriction should be read into the order to prevent the Crown applying to amend the notice of appeal in this Court’s task of quelling the controversy by rehearing it. 
     
      
       
      Whether s 68A was an impermissible interference with judicial power 
       
      
    31 Mr Game initially put this submission based on Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions [1996] HCA 24; 189 CLR 51 and International Finance Trust Co Limited v New South Wales Crime Commission [2009] HCA 49; 84 ALJR 31. This submission identified as crucial the broad interpretation of double jeopardy originally asserted by the Crown. In the face of the relatively narrow interpretation on which the Attorney General and the Crown ultimately relied in argument (see R v JW at [49] and [141]), the argument based on Kable was barely pressed. This is understandable. So understood, s 68A does not affect the integrity of the Supreme Court nor does it place it in any position of dictation by the executive or Parliament. 
     
      
    32 However, Mr Game maintained the position that, even on this narrow construction, s 68A was invalid. He emphasised that the Court was exercising federal jurisdiction, because of the existence within the controversy of an issue engaging s 76(i) of the Constitution and because the Court was exercising a power under and through the Judiciary Act, s 37. That being the case, he submitted that s 68A impermissibly directed the Court how to exercise its judicial power in a manner which deprived it of the necessary quality of impartiality: Nicholas v The Queen [1998] HCA 9; 193 CLR 173 esp at 208-209; approved in Bass v Permanent Trustee Co Ltd [1999] HCA 9; 198 CLR 334 at 359 [56]. 
     
      
    33 We reject this submission. On the narrow construction submitted, s 68A does not direct the Court to act in a way that is repugnant to the judicial process. It removes one aspect for consideration in the judicial and sentencing process on a Crown appeal. Section 68A does not compromise the essential character of the Court, nor does it require the Court to proceed in a manner that compromises equality before the law, impartiality or substantive fairness of process, they being essential attributes of judicial power, State or federal. Nor does s 68A direct the Court as to the judgment or order it might make. Rather, it removes one aspect from judicial consideration being double jeopardy expressed in R v JW at [141(ii)] as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the element of distress and anxiety to which all respondents to a Crown appeal are presumed to be subject.” 
        
       
      
    34 This conclusion was based on the confined submission of the Attorney General (R v JW at [49]) that the discount discussed in the Parliamentary speeches introducing the Bill was: 
     
      
       
        
        “The discount was intended to reflect the distress and anxiety of facing sentence again irrespective of the circumstances of the particular offender.” 
        
       
      
    35 It was submitted that the operation of s 68A (limited as it is to Crown appeals) would lead to inconsistent outcomes where there was also a sentence appeal by the offender. We do not see that as likely to occur. Crown appeals and resentencing within them will be founded on error leading to inadequacy of sentence and as such the intersection with an offender’s appeal is unlikely. Section 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 applies to an offender’s sentence appeal, but not to a Crown appeal. In any event, such is not sufficient to invalidate s 68A as the product of an exercise of Parliamentary law making. 
     
      
    36 Ultimately, the submission was that the Parliament could not legislate to require the Court to ignore one human consideration from the judicial approach to sentencing on a Crown appeal because to do so directed the Court to act partially and unfairly. We do not accept that. It can be accepted that our rejection of the argument involves a normative assessment of the effect of s 68A narrowly construed as it is. The argument might be of significantly more force and weight if the Crown’s first construction of the content of s 68A had been maintained. 
     
      
    37 Finally, Mr Game submitted that the retrospective operation of s 68A meant that it was invalid to that extent. He relied on what was said by Deane J (in the minority) in Polyukhovich v The Commonwealth [1991] HCA 32; 172 CLR 501 at 608. We reject this submission. A majority in Polyukhovich concluded that the retrospective creation of substantive criminal law in question did not offend Ch III of the Constitution. To a degree, Mr Game’s argument on retrospectivity drew upon other strands of his argument which we have already addressed: repugnancy with the judicial process and inconsistency with s 37. 
     
      
    38 In our view, s 68A is not invalid. 
     
      
       
      The application to amend the notice of appeal 
       
      
    39 At the hearing on 10 July 2009 the Crown applied to amend its notice of appeal by particularising six grounds: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentence was manifestly inadequate because the sentencing Judge erred in the following respects: 
        
       
       
        
        1. Finding that the youth of the respondent and the need to foster his rehabilitation reduced the need for retribution and general deterrence; 
        
       
       
        
        2. Gave too much weight to the respondent’s subjective circumstances and failed to appreciate the objective seriousness of the offence; 
        
       
       
        
        3. Finding that there were exceptional circumstances such that a sentence of periodic detention would reflect the objective seriousness of the offence and fulfil the manifold purposes of punishment; 
        
       
       
        
        4. Finding (at ROS 2.7), being an error of fact, that the respondent was ‘about 15 metres in front of the group before the victim approached Ms Kitchener, rush past Ms Kitchener and his brother and said, “You, want to talk about gun” and head butted the victim in the face’ – par [15] Crown submissions; 
        
       
       
        
        5. Having already taken youth into account as a mitigating factor, using it again to find special circumstances – par [22] Crown submissions; 
        
       
       
        
        6. The reason for finding special circumstances, for special psychological treatment, did not ultimately become the fact because periodic detention was imposed – par [23] Crown submissions.” 
        
       
      
    40 Whilst the remitter under s 37 did not prevent this Court entertaining the application, whether it should be granted is another matter. The six grounds need to be viewed in two distinct groups. The first three were the matters raised and argued in the first appeal to this Court and in the High Court. At that time, a procedure was then generally adopted by the Crown not to particularise generally worded notices of appeal that referred to manifest inadequacy. The consequences of this can be seen in the High Court’s reasons in [8] and [9] and in this Court’s reasons in R v JW. 
     
      
    41 We see no unfairness in permitting the first three grounds to be included in the notice of appeal. It will regularise the argument to reflect what was remitted from the High Court. 
     
      
    42 The second three grounds are in a different category. These matters were first raised over twelve months after the appeal was instituted and after two appeal hearings: in this Court on the first occasion and in the High Court. In the light of the matters to which we make reference below in sentencing Mr Carroll, there is a degree of unfairness and oppression in the Crown expanding its case at this late stage. It can be met, no doubt. But in facing his third appellate process, Mr Carroll might be thought to be entitled to a modicum of stability in what is put against him by the Crown. 
     
      
    43 We would be inclined to reject the amendment by adding the three new grounds on this basis alone. However, we are of the view that the sentencing judge erred in the characterisation of the objective seriousness of the offence and in her treatment of general deterrence (matters covered by grounds 1 and 2 of the notice of appeal). In these circumstances, the three later grounds are unnecessary. In these circumstances, we would reject the application to amend the notice of appeal by relying upon grounds 4, 5 and 6. 
     
      
       
        
       
       
      The offence and the sentencing judge’s remarks 
      
    44 The following recitation of facts is taken from the sentencing judge’s remarks. At 1 pm, on Sunday 20 May 2007, Mr Carroll, his older brother, and a friend went to the Gladstone Hotel in Marrickville. There they had lunch, drank alcohol and watched football on the television. While there, they socialised with two young women. While Mr Carroll and the others were at the hotel, the victim and a 55 year old friend were at the hotel drinking and playing the gaming machines. Shortly before closing time at 10 pm, one of the two women had a conversation with the victim and his friend. The young woman apparently convinced the victim to collect his winnings (some $700) rather than continuing to play and lose any more than the $300 he had already lost. Having been convinced to quit while he was ahead, the victim handed the young woman $50 to buy a round of drinks for her group of friends. She took the money, but as the bar was closed she was prevented from purchasing another round. She attempted to return the $50 to the victim. He would not take it. He suggested she try the bottle shop. She kept the money and returned to the group that included Mr Carroll. Shortly thereafter, Mr Carroll, his brother, his friend and the two young women left the hotel, heading in the direction of Mr Carroll’s home. At about the same time, the victim walked out of the hotel. It is convenient to set out the terms of the findings of the sentencing judge as to what then happened: 
     
      
       
        
        “[Mr Criniti] called out to [the young woman] ‘Hey give me my $50’. He then approached the group and said to [the young woman], ‘Where’s the $50?’. [She] said to [Mr Carroll’s brother] ‘I’ve got the $50, I can give it back to him’. [Mr Carroll’s brother] said, ‘No, no, no, fuck it’. [Mr Carroll’s friend] said to the victim, ‘What’s your problem? Fuck off and go home.’ 
        
       
       
        
        At this time the victim was standing in front of [the young woman] and [Mr Carroll’s brother]. It is alleged that [Mr Carroll’s brother] pushed the victim causing him to take one step backwards. After being pushed the victim said, ‘I’ll get a gun and shoot youse all’. He was also heard to say, ‘I’m going to kill your whole family’ by a young man who worked in a restaurant close by. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender, who had been about 15 metres in front of the group before the victim approached [the young woman], rushed past [her] and his brother and said, ‘You want to talk about guns’ and head butted the victim in the face. The victim immediately fell backwards onto Marrickville Road where the back of his head hit the roadway with force. [Mr Criniti’s friend] and a female shopkeeper went to his aid. The offender told his brother to ring an ambulance and he did so. The offender and his friends then returned home. 
        
       
       
        
        [Mr Carroll’s friend] asked the offender, ‘What happened?’ The offender replied, ‘I head butted him’.” 
        
       
      
    45 The sentencing judge recounted the observations of the ambulance officer as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “… he noticed the victim had swelling to the front of his lips, a haematoma, and abrasions to his occipital region. He also noticed that he was heavily intoxicated.” 
        
       
      
    46 Mr Criniti was admitted to Royal Prince Alfred Hospital where his condition deteriorated. He died on 30 May 2007. 
     
      
    47 The day after the incident, after speaking with his father, Mr Carroll caused a solicitor to contact Newtown police. He later attended Newtown police station. 
     
      
    48 The post mortem revealed a cut inside Mr Criniti’s top lip, bruising around the nose, a fracture to the back of the skull, bleeding on the brain and a subdural haemorrhage. 
     
      
    49 The sentencing judge referred to the remarks of Street CJ in R v Hill [1983] 3 A Crim R 397, as to the protean character of the offence of manslaughter and the infinite variety of circumstances in which it might arise. It is appropriate to set out part of the Chief Justice’s reasons in Hill (at 402) that appear to have been of particular relevance to her Honour: 
     
      
       
        
        “The courts have however over the decades gradually manifested a willingness to recognise factual contexts which provide some basis for understanding the human tragedies that can lead to the taking of a life. The manifestation of this humanitarian tendency is necessarily attended by the utmost caution. It can be seen to be constantly written in the decisions of the courts and in the enactments of the legislature that the taking of a human life is a grave action calling for a correspondingly grave measure of criminal justice being meted out to the guilty party. 
        
       
       
        
        In a case such as the present, where there is material justifying a degree of understanding and of sympathy towards the appellant, the task of sentencing is particularly difficult. It is necessary to evaluate the demands of the criminal justice system, the expectations of the community at large, the subjective circumstances of the person coming forward for criminal judgment and the interest of society in protecting itself and its members from criminal activity amounting, as in the present case, to the talking of a life.” 
         
        
       
      
    50 Her Honour then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “This is very much a case where there is material justifying a degree of understanding and of sympathy towards the offender. At the time of these events he was 20 years old. He had successfully negotiated high school where in his final year he had been a prefect, and had received both the Principal’s Award, and the Community Spirit Award. He had never been a problem to his parents and was, according to his mother, always helpful and good humoured. He was in his second year of a plumbing apprenticeship and was a highly valued employee. He was the captain of his rugby league team and was renowned for stepping in to calm situations on the field before they got out of hand. In his 17 year playing career he had never been sent to the sin bin or sent off. He had certainly never been in trouble with the criminal law. 
        
       
       
        
        In the light of all the material before me about this young man what occurred on the night of 20 May 2007 is inexplicable. He is unable to explain it. What is clear is that the events of that night have touched him deeply and irrevocably. He is no longer the carefree young man he was. He lives each day conscious that he has taken a human life. He suspended his apprenticeship as he felt it was unfair to his employer to keep working as he was too distressed, anxious and depressed to do the job properly. He stopped playing football as he felt emotionally unable to face people. 
        
       
       
        
        He has been diagnosed as suffering clinically significant levels of depression and anxiety. He is troubled by thoughts of worthlessness, hopelessness, and personal failure. He has almost entirely ceased using alcohol. And yet to keep himself busy he sought and obtained labouring work which requires less concentration than his apprenticeship, and he has sought to deal with his emotional distress by undergoing treatment with Professor Stephen Woods, clinical psychologist, as he feels that confronting his sense of guilty and remorse, though painful, would benefit him. 
        
       
       
        
        I am satisfied that this young man genuinely understands the enormity of what he has done, and the suffering he has caused. I am also satisfied that he will live with what he has done for the rest of his life.” 
        
       
      
    51 The sentencing judge accepted the submission put on behalf of Mr Carroll that the offence lay towards the bottom of the range of objective seriousness for offences of manslaughter because there was provocation, there was only one blow which was spontaneous and no weapon was involved. 
     
      
    52 It was common ground that none of the aggravating factors in the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (NSW) had application. 
     
      
    53 After referring to the terms of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, s 3A, the sentencing judge said the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “In the light of the material before me I do not consider that the sentence I impose needs to reflect any measure of personal deterrence or the protection of society, and whilst retribution and general deterrence remain of importance, that importance is reduced to an extent because of the youth of the offender and the need to foster his rehabilitation, although the mitigating effect of his youth is less in this case than it would be if he were under eighteen. 
        
       
       
        
        I am satisfied from the material before me that the offender has excellent prospect of rehabilitation. 
        
       
       
        
        Mr Bonnici, who appears for the offender, has submitted that I would find special circumstances, the Crown does not disagree. I propose to do so because of the offender’s youth and his very real need for continued specialist psychological treatment, which Professor Stephen Woods believes is unavailable in a correctional centre. 
        
       
       
        
        I have had regard to the Judicial Commission statistics for the offence of manslaughter where the proceedings are concluded in the District Court. I recognise that the statistics are a blunt tool as they tell me nothing about the circumstances of the offence or the offender, but they are of some value as a reference point. Those statistics indicate that 77% of people dealt with for this offence in the period October 2000 to September 2007 have imposed a sentence of full time imprisonment. I have also had regard to a number of cases provided to me by the parties for my assistance. 
        
       
       
        
        There is no doubt that a sentence of imprisonment is required. In all the circumstances of this case I consider that a sentence of three years is the appropriate sentence. Mr Bonnici has submitted that it I were to consider that a sentence of three years or less was appropriate I would then consider whether that sentence could be served by way of periodic detention.” 
         
        
       
      
    54 At this point, the sentencing judge considered the question of periodic detention raised by Mr Carroll’s counsel. Her Honour referred to R v Dodd (1991) 57 A Crim R 349. 
     
      
    55 Her Honour made clear that she found the sentencing exercise a difficult one, but came to the view that periodic detention was appropriate, saying the following: 
     
      
       
        
        “I have thought long and hard about this matter. As Justice Hulme pointed out in  
        The Queen v Smith  
        [2008] NSWSC 201: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The rigours of incarceration for a person such as this offender are real, and the effect of incarceration does not cease immediately upon release.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        But on the other hand, and this is one of the factors that makes sentencing in this area difficult – the deceased has forever been deprived of these opportunities. 
        
       
       
        
        I have come to the conclusion that in the exceptional circumstances of this case a sentence of periodic detention would reflect the object seriousness of the offence, and would fulfil the manifold purposes of sentencing.” 
        
       
      
     
     
      
      The errors in the approach of the sentencing judge 
       
      
    56 We see two errors in the approach of the sentencing judge, being (a) her Honour’s characterisation of the objective seriousness of the offence and (b) her Honour’s approach to general deterrence. We are satisfied that, as a consequence of these errors, the sentence imposed in the District Court was manifestly inadequate in the well-recognised sense that it was unreasonable or plainly unjust: Markarian v The Queen [2005] HCA 25; 228 CLR 357 at 370-371 [25]; Carroll v The Queen at 581 [8]-[9] (set out at [25] above). 
     
      
       
      The objective seriousness of the offence 
       
      
    57 As the High Court made clear at 584 [24] (see [26] above), it was (and remains) open to this Court to form a view different from the primary judge about where, on an objective scale of offending, Mr Carroll’s conduct stood, provided the Court does not repeat the errors found to have been committed by this Court at the first hearing. 
     
      
    58 A complete assessment of the objective seriousness of the crime of manslaughter in this case could not be undertaken without some assessment of the comparative size and age of the offender and the victim. In this case, the offender was about 30 years younger than the victim and was a powerfully built young man who played as a front-row forward in competitive rugby league. The victim was a middle-aged man of comparatively slight build. Likewise, an appropriate assessment of the objective seriousness of the crime required some assessment of the method of attack utilised by the offender, namely a head butt. This form of physical attack is, in our view, a seriously aggravating feature in an offence of this type.  
     
      
    59 The character of a head butt that should be recognised is that it is a single blow by the head or forehead to the face (nose and mouth) of the victim delivered through the power of the neck and upper body. It is a blow of significant objective force and is inherently brutal. It was not a “bop on the head” as Mr Game put in argument (T24-25, 10 July 2009). The above is not to find facts, but to state what a head butt is, about which there could be no debate as flowing from the findings of the sentencing judge. The blow being delivered in these circumstances by a 20 year old man of strong physique to a 51 year old man of manifestly weaker stature, despite some provocation, leads to the conclusion that the offence cannot be viewed as lying towards the bottom of the range of objective seriousness for offences of manslaughter. There may have been only one blow and it may be characterised as spontaneous with some provocation, but it was a blow of a violent and brutal character which made the objective characterisation of the offence by the sentence judge insupportable. 
     
      
       
      General deterrence 
       
      
    60 This Court observed in Hopley v R [2008] NSWCCA 105 at [46] that, regrettably, “single-blow manslaughter cases (by unlawful and dangerous act) are not rare in this State.” It was said in Hopley v R at [47]: 
     
      
       
        
        “As the learned sentencing judge correctly observed (by reference to  
        R v Grenenger 
        ), this case is a further example of the disastrous consequences which can flow from a public affray in a place of lawful public resort. The violence of the Applicant was perpetrated in a public street where persons were present and where it constitutes a particular affront to civil peace to have a man killed in this way:  
        R v Inzitari 
         (NSW Court of Criminal Appeal, 28 March 1985). It was necessary for the Applicant to be punished for his crime and for an element of general deterrence to be reflected in the sentence.” 
        
       
      
    61 The sentencing decision with respect to the present offender required the element of general deterrence to be reflected in the sentence. Although the learned sentencing judge referred to general deterrence, we are satisfied that the sentence actually imposed at first instance in this case made no proper allowance for this significant sentencing principle. Mr Carroll was 20 years old, a young adult, at the time of the offence. The principles which apply directly to the sentencing of juvenile offenders, and the approach to general deterrence and rehabilitation, were not applicable to his case. Of course, his relative youth and his prospects of rehabilitation remained significant factors on sentence. However, alcohol-fuelled offences of violence of this type are frequently committed by young men of his age, and general deterrence has particular application for this reason. 
     
      
       
      The objective and subjective circumstances 
       
      
    62 In R v MD [2005] NSWCCA 342; 156 A Crim R 372 at 387 [65], this Court (McClellan CJ at CL, Simpson and Howie JJ) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “In many cases where an offender is convicted of manslaughter there will be exculpatory matters and personal circumstances that can lead the court to significantly ameliorate the sentence which might otherwise be imposed. However, as this Court pointed out in  
        R v Troja 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, NSW, No 606394 of 1990, 16 July 1991) it is important for the court to ensure that the subjective circumstances of an individual offender do not divert the court from imposing a sentence which adequately reflects the part which the law must play in upholding the protection of human life and in punishing those who take it.” 
        
       
       
      We are satisfied that the sentencing judge was diverted in this case by Mr Carroll’s undoubtedly strong subjective circumstances so as to impose a sentence which did not reflect the serious objective circumstances of the offence:  
      R v Dodd 
       at 354. We find that ground 2 is made good, and serves to explain how an unreasonable or plainly unjust sentence was imposed at first instance. 
       
       
      The question of Judicial Commission statistics 
       
      
    63 There is one other aspect of the sentencing judge’s remarks which calls for comment, though it is not operative to our reasons. Her Honour had regard to Judicial Commission statistics for the offence of manslaughter where the proceedings had been concluded in the District Court (see the extract from the remarks on sentence at [53] above). This issue was touched upon in oral submissions on the present appeal. It should be observed that, to the extent that sentencing statistics were of assistance, the appropriate course was to refer to sentencing statistics for manslaughter offences dealt with in the Supreme and District Courts. It is a fact that a significantly larger number of manslaughter cases were disposed of between 2001 and 2008 in the Supreme Court (208 cases) as opposed to the District Court (32 cases). Her Honour’s attention was drawn to a number of single-blow manslaughter cases where sentence was imposed in the Supreme Court, as well as a number in the District Court. Of course, the same maximum penalty is available in both the Supreme Court and District Court when sentencing for manslaughter. This Court has observed more than once that particular care is required in using sentencing statistics for crimes of manslaughter: Salah v R [2009] NSWCCA 2 at [40]; Jones v R [2009] NSWCCA 169 at [41]. To the extent that sentencing statistics for manslaughter are taken into account, there is no warrant for a sentencing judge to confine attention to statistics for offences dealt with in the District Court for this class of offence. 
     
      
      The appropriate sentence 
       
      
    64 We have concluded that a significant period of full-time imprisonment was required, at first instance, having regard to the objectively serious crime committed by Mr Carroll and the need properly to reflect general deterrence. This approach was necessary even allowing for Mr Carroll’s strong subjective case. 
     
      
    65 It was therefore necessary for this Court to sentence Mr Carroll. It is unnecessary to repeat the personal circumstances of Mr Carroll recited by the sentencing judge and which are found at [50] above. Since being first sentenced, Mr Carroll has been buffeted by the operation of the legal system in a manner which must be recognised. He served imprisonment by way of periodic detention between 24 April 2008 and 19 September 2008. He was then incarcerated full-time for seven months between 19 September 2008 and 29 April 2009. His appeal to the High Court was successful. On 29 April 2009, he was given bail over the objection of the Crown. His appeal has been extended in its duration by the passing of retrospective legislation that attracted serious Constitutional challenge. The imposition of these matters upon him can be recognised not to be of his making (other than through the commission of the offence). 
     
      
    66 Affidavits read at the hearing of the Crown appeal have informed the Court of steps taken by him while the Crown appeal has been on foot. Mr Carroll’s evidence as to his life since the night in question point in an understated but clear way to the devastating impact the offence and the sentences of imprisonment have had on him. He has advanced his life as best as he has been able by further education. He has one year to go as an apprentice before he becomes a plumber. His personal circumstances reveal the heavy psychological burden the legal process has had on him. We exclude from consideration that element of double jeopardy precluded by s 68A (see [33] and [34] above). 
     
      
    67 On 9 December 2009, we were of the view that, in the light of the combined periods of periodic and full-time imprisonment and the personal circumstances of Mr Carroll and the strain of the extended legal process over 2008 and 2009, the recognition of the objective seriousness of the offence and the necessary consideration of general deterrence would be satisfied by recognising Mr Carroll’s imprisonment in the past and imposing a further 18 month suspended sentence. This reflected the unique set of circumstances surrounding Mr Carroll by December 2009. 
     
      
    68 For the reasons we have given the application for leave to appeal against the severity of the sentence must be refused. 
     
      
    69 These are our reasons for the making of the orders on 9 December 2009. 
     
      
    70 It has come to our attention that there was an error in order 3 made on 9 December 2009. By reason of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, s 12(3) Part 4 of the Act did not apply to require a provision for the commencement of the sentence. The bond commenced from the date of the orders. Any sentence of imprisonment would only commence if and when the suspension order is revoked, in which circumstance the Court would then make an order as to the date upon which the sentence commences.71 KIRBY J: I agree with Allsop P and Johnson J.

   JUDGMENT[Please note some sensitive material has been removed from this report of the remarks on sentence.]1. Each of Chade Sam Weyermann and Jonathan Powell has pleaded guilty to robbing the Dubbo Railway Club, three days before Christmas, of $40,929 whilst being armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a .22 calibre pump action rifle. The third man, Grant Bartley, alleged by the Crown to be the mastermind, director and participant, has a contested hearing scheduled some time after today. ... Today, Weyermann and Powell are each to be held accountable for their part in the Dubbo Railway Club robbery.2. As sentencing judge, it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence before this Court committed by these offenders targeting that railway club in the community of Dubbo; see Gladue v The Queen [1999] 1SCR 688 [80]. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of this offence before the court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to each of the offenders, called subjective matters. The starting point for these assessments requires me to make findings of fact from evidence before the Court, relating to both the offence and to the offenders. 3. My fact finding task has been circumscribed, in that the parties have tendered an agreed set of facts to which I will shortly return. It is sufficient at this point that I remind the Court, a judge, is not a party to any agreed set of facts between the parties. The tender of an agreed set of facts does not relieve the judge from a fact-finding responsibility; it simply limits the material from which facts may be found. To the extent, if it be the case, that the facts as agreed do not reflect the actual events that occurred, it must be remembered that a court can only find facts from evidence placed before it.4. Each offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed, even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, back-up charges brought from the Local Court to this Court and finally, of course, the ultimate terms of imprisonment or other penalties to be imposed. None of these can be commenced until the primary facts are determined.5. What weight needs to be given to all of that, against the imperative that all sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community, also needs to be determined; see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740. Facts6. Grant Bartley, aged forty-two at the time of the offence, met Samuel Chad Weyermann, aged twenty-two, the night before the offence. There is some suggestion that these two may have known each other prior to that date. Jonathan Powell, aged twenty, had known Bartley for a period dating from a time that they had both worked at the abattoirs. 7. Powell is aged twenty- two; twenty years younger than Bartley. Bartley and Powell were certainly acquaintances of some standing. Both Bartley and Powell were experienced in the use of firearms. Powell had gained much of his experience from school cadets.Preparation8. This material applies to Powell only. A week before the robbery Powell saw Bartley with a .32 or .38 calibre pistol small enough to fit into the palm of a man’s hand. It was old and rusty, had a small magazine which was inserted, or to be inserted as the case may be, into the pistol’s grip. The loading mechanism was mounted towards the rear of the barrel which was pulled back to raise a cartridge into the breach chamber. It was described as an automatic but more likely was a semi-automatic. 9. Early on Sunday 21 December 2008, the day before the robbery, Powell drove to Lithgow to collect Bartley from a railway station and drive him back to Dubbo. On the return journey Bartley raised a proposition that he and Powell commit a robbery of some form on a club as he, Bartley, was of the view that the takings from the various Christmas parties being held at that time in Dubbo would make such a robbery very profitable. 10. It was decided that the enterprise would be extended to include a third person, namely, Weyermann, who had recently been released from prison on parole in relation to a sentence imposed for a series of offences on 4 December 2008 eighteen days prior. This evidence is tendered against Powell only. Sam Weyermann and Powell had been friends, indeed Powell regarded Weyermann as his best friend; (that is actually in evidence in any event in the hearings, that can stay). It was Powell who put forward Weyermann’s name to Bartley, the alleged mastermind. 11. Bartley suggested Powell call Weyermann, drive to Mudgee to collect Weyermann and bring Weyermann back. Powell did drive to Mudgee to collect Weyermann and told him of the plan to do a robbery on the way back to Dubbo. That suggests to me that Weyermann was not aware of the robbery until after he had entered the motor vehicle. 12. After obtaining some food for Weyermann, Powell and Weyermann drove to where Bartley was staying and collected him. This again is taken from evidence tendered only against Powell. Initially it was contemplated the robbery would be done on the Sunday night. From Bartley’s point of view two recreational clubs were under consideration. The three offenders drove to each of the potential targets, namely, the Dubbo City Bowling Club and the Dubbo Railway Bowling Club to ascertain whether the robbery could occur on that evening. 13. On both occasions Bartley entered the premises alone with a pistol down his pants and returned to the other two advising them there were too many people and too much security in both establishments to conduct a robbery that evening. It was decided it would be better to conduct the robbery the following morning. 14. The three then drove to Bartley’s residence. Bartley went into the house there and obtained a shortened firearm, ammunition and a pair of overalls to be worn by Weyermann during the robbery now planned for the following day.15. Powell and Weyermann left Bartley at his residence and returned to Powell’s home where they stayed the night. In the course of that night Powell cleaned the shortened firearm whilst Weyermann played an X Box video game and watched television. Powell had been requested to show Weyermann how to use this weapon but there is no evidence that that occurred. Powell was also to clean the weapon and metal studs on the overalls so that there would be no fingerprints relating to Bartley on either. 16. The following morning Powell, with Weyermann, drove to Bartley’s residence where they waited outside until he came to the car at about 8.30. All then drove to Centrelink in the centre of Dubbo. Whilst there Powell and Weyermann went to Coles where Weyermann purchased food. The three men met up, drove to Riverdale Shopping Centre, Bartley purchased a long neck of beer and Powell walked across the street from the shopping centre to a camping shop where he purchased a black balaclava to be worn by Weyermann during the robbery. In a later interview with police Powell asserts that purchase was made at the direction of Bartley.The Robbery17. Powell drove Weyermann and Bartley to a spot near the Dubbo Railway Bowling Club. Powell (as said) told the other two offenders he was going into the club to check it out and would give the green light if the situation was good for a robbery to take place. CCTV footage shows Bartley first entering the club at 10.21am. Powell claims that Bartley had a pistol down his pants. CCTV footage shows Powell entering the club and speaking with Bartley on two occasions prior to the robbery taking place. 18. In a later interview Powell asserts that he was telling Bartley he wanted no part in the robbery. About 11.16 Bartley left the club, walked to where Powell had parked the car and spoke to Powell and Weyermann. Bartley re-entered the club at 11.32. Three minutes later at 11.35 Weyermann enters the club, dressed in khaki overalls and a balaclava carrying a loaded shortened firearm. That firearm was of course the one that had been given to them by Bartley the day before. At the time Weyermann entered the club, the fifty-eight-year old secretary manager of it, Douglas Burke, was in his office situate near the front entrance of the club. Powell had prepared the rifle as I earlier mentioned and had overseen the loading of it, in fact I understand he did load it with the ammunition. Weyermann approached the manager saying, “Money, money”, and pointing the loaded shortened firearm towards Burke’s torso. Burke sensibly told Weyermann the money was in the safe and led him to the safe which was down near the bar area. As Burke led Weyermann towards the safe two other workers at the club, Steve Chapman and Cindy Kelly, who were working in that area, assisted Burke load or give to Weyermann a blue banking bag containing nearly $41,000 in cash and cheques. Weyermann then ran from the club outside and was driven from the scene by Powell. CCTV footage shows Weyermann left the club at 11.37am. Bartley was present at the club during the robbery. Powell rapidly drove from the club. he stopped at a nature reserve where the weapon used in the robbery was thrown into the river. Whilst there Powell phoned Bartley leaving a message for him, a voice message. Powell then drove Weyermann to another location where shoes worn by Weyermann during the robbery and the blue bag, absent the money, were hidden in a table drain. Powell then drove to his home where the stolen money, khaki overalls and balaclava were hidden. Once at Powell’s home Bartley rang Powell and said, “Don’t fuck with my money.” Powell was also told to hide Weyermann, and Bartley indicated that he would be catching up with Powell later. Police Investigation19. Silent security alarms had been activated during the robbery. Police attended the Railway Bowling Club within a very short time frame and obtained description of the robber. A magazine of ammunition was located at the scene. It had fallen somehow from the weapon. A description of the robber was broadcast to other police. On the basis of the description given police came to a view that Sam Weyermann was the person who was the robber.20. Powell’s parents were at home when Powell and Weyermann arrived and observed that Powell appeared to be in an extremely distressed state. Powell told his father that he had been threatened by an unknown man and made to drive to Brocklehurst. Powell’s father contacted the Dubbo Police Station and informed them of what he had been told by his son. He was advised that police would attend shortly. 21. When Powell’s father contacted the police Weyermann was already their prime suspect for the robbery and they were able to ascertain that Powell and Weyermann were associates. Police phoned the Powell residence back and spoke to Powell’s father Jonathon who reiterated the story of his son having been threatened by an unknown man and made to drive to Brocklehurst. Police attended Powell’s residence within a short time. 22. There Powell was observed to be in a distressed state. Weyermann was also seen and identified. What was noticed was that Weyermann appeared to have been trying to alter his appearance by cutting his hair. Powell was spoken to away from Weyermann and then nominated Weyermann as having been involved in the robbery as well as Grant Bartley. On the basis of that information Weyermann was then arrested then conveyed to the Dubbo Police Station. 23. Powell’s premises were searched and a bag containing the stolen money, overalls and balaclava were located by Jonathon Powell who had been assisting in the search. All of the stolen money was retrieved. Powell went with police and showed them where the gun had been thrown in the river. It was retrieved and examined and found to be a shortened .22 long rifle calibre Unique manufactured self loading rifle, its serial number was still intact. The firearm is a prohibited weapon within the definition contained in the Firearms Act 1996. Powell also showed police where Weyermann’s shoes and blue bag in which the money had originally been located were hidden and these items were also recovered. The .38 pistol allegedly carried by Bartley has not been recovered. 24. Weyermann, upon his arrest, was advised of his rights and agreed to participate in an electronically recorded interview in which he admitted his part in the armed robbery but did not nominate anyone else as having been involved. He was charged and has been bail refused since his arrest. 25. After the recovery of the items Powell was advised of his rights and agreed to participate in an interview with police where he made admissions as to his involvement in the offence including collecting Weyermann from Mudgee, driving to the club, driving from the club, and as to the disposal of the weapon and other items. Powell nominated that Bartley was involved in the enterprise. Powell was charged and granted conditional bail. 26. Later the same day Bartley was arrested. He was spoken to at the club soon after the robbery. He said that he had not seen anything suspicious at the club prior to the robbery. Police came back to him later where he told police that he did not know anything and he had not seen Jonathon Powell all that day. They arrested Bartley, took him back to Dubbo, he declined to participate in an interview, as was his right. He was charged and has been bail refused.27. On 22 February 2009 Powell came to the police station and participated in a further interview, giving a detailed account of the planning and execution of the robbery. Powell’s version of events has Bartley as the planner of the robbery, Weyermann as an enthusiastic participant and Powell describes himself as a reluctant participant.... 28. Weyermann was further interviewed by police on 5 June, in which he again admitted his involvement in the enterprise and portrays Powell as directing him as to what to do prior to the robbery. Weyermann nominates Bartley as also being involved in the enterprise.Court Proceedings29. On 13 May 2009 and 3 June 2009, respectively, Weyermann initially and Powell subsequently entered pleas of guilty at the Local Court to charges contrary to s 97(2) of the Crimes Act 1900. Each was committed for sentence.... Objective Criminality30. From the facts as he finds them to be the sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of this offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of each offender. That will be done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in this offence and in respect of each offender, with criminality established in other offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of this offence, in respect of each offender, can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important impact upon the overall sentencing outcome. 31. The essence of “robbery” is that violence is done or is threatened to the owner or custodian of goods who stands between an offender and the property to be stolen. That violence has a purpose; it seeks to overcome that person’s resistance, so that the person becomes obliged to part with the property against his or her will. The victim of the robbery is in that sense compelled by force or fear to submit to theft. Such conduct is grossly antisocial and that is the essence of its criminality. “Theft” is a crime against property, the property of another person is stolen by one who has no ownership rights or any other right to the property. Thus, armed robbery is not simply a crime against property, as such, but a crime against persons as well.32. As this case illustrates, the fear engendered is so real and so powerful that its effects may well last long after the robber has quit the scene. The objective criminality therefore focuses upon the impact of the conduct the robber has on the persons and also upon the nature of the goods and value of the goods taken by the thief.33. I am satisfied there was substantial discussion, at least over several days, if not longer, between Powell and Bartley as to how the robbery would be conducted and potential targets of that robbery. That discussion included the recruitment of Weyermann. That recruitment I am satisfied was sponsored by Powell on the basis that he was close to Weyermann and could trust him. The recruitment was also delivered by Powell. Weyermann’s criminality, therefore, has a much shorter history than Powell’s. Indeed, in such planning as occurred after his inclusion into the criminal trio, sees him taking direction rather than offering any. Powell’s Role34. Powell supplies the vehicle and drives it; that vehicle is used both in the planning stage, the performance of the offence and the subsequent getaway. Powell cleans the weapon allocated to Weyermann. Powell is the one who loads it with ammunition. It is he who purchases the black balaclava worn by Weyermann. He claims to respond to directions from Bartley. While that may well be so, I am satisfied at this point in time he was a willing participant. I do not find any reluctance in him at all based upon the morality of the exercise he was about to embark upon. Such reservations as he may have had were as to his safety. I note that one robbery was abandoned at his direction but not the other.35. Upon completion of the robbery Powell drove rapidly away with the booty, the rifle and the actual robber. Then Powell disposed of the weapon, drove to another location and disposed of the shoes and the bag in which the money was delivered. There is nothing in the facts to suggest he was acting, on that occasion, in accordance with any directions from Bartley. Powell then drove to his own home to secure the overalls, balaclava and most importantly, of course, the booty. 36. After the robbery the enormity of what had been involved may well have hit Powell. Instead of rendezvousing at Devil’s Elbow Reserve, he returned home, which he no doubt thought a more secure location for him. There he participated in a deliberate ruse upon his family. He presented in a false but distressed state. He claimed falsely to have been threatened by an unknown armed man and made to drive to Brocklehurst. That fabrication had a purpose. It was to establish a false alibi. His father accepted his distress as genuine. So I regard it as part of a deliberate ploy to give himself, and possibly Weyermann, an alibi for the time of the robbery.37. There is hearsay evidence from the father, I think it was, that Weyermann was the person responsible for this heartless charade. I do not act on that hearsay evidence, I reject it, it is consistent with the offender’s discussion to minimising his role even at the cost of friendship. I am prepared to accept Weyermann may have contributed to the creation of the false alibi, but I do not accept that he was the architect.Weyermann’s Role38. I turn now to look at Weyermann’s role. He was recently released to parole on condition that he would be of good behaviour. When approached by Powell, in the vehicle I note, it would appear he needed no persuasion. He listened carefully to instructions, particularly from Bartley. So far as I can tell he was prepared to rob any venue Bartley settled on. He was willing to wear the overalls, the balaclava and carry the loaded rifle assigned to him. He carried the weapon from the vehicle to the club, that is across some public space, he demanded money from behind the black balaclava covering his face. There were three victims submitting to his demands. I note there is a fourth victim impact statement and have assumed the fourth person was a worker nearby, although not directly, apparently, subject to menace of the pump action rifle. This robbery had a sustained duration by comparison with many robberies. The term “sustained” needs to be understood against the two minute time span that the offender was in the club. He has to be taken to the safe, the money has to be stashed into the blue banking bag and possibly a red one and then delivered to Weyermann. I accept Powell’s evidence that Weyermann was untrained in weapons. His possession and use of a loaded weapon in this highly charged atmosphere was a recipe for disaster. 39. Weyermann told Anna Robilliard he was unaware of whether the weapon was loaded. Frankly I find that difficult to accept. He also told Ms Robilliard the magazine fell out onto the floor but he did not stop to pick it up, suggesting that he was aware it had fallen. The point at which it fell out has not been established in evidence. The criminality of taking a loaded gun into a robbery is not lightly to be mitigated and in this case has not been mitigated by the loss of the magazine. Certainly from the point of view of the victims there is no evidence any of them was aware the magazine had been lost. 40. I agree with Weyermann’s comment that he is blessed that no one was injured, or worse. That is particularly so because he was in a heightened or charged up mood. While I do not have confidence in Powell’s diagnosis of “irrational” I am prepared to accept Weyermann’s adrenalin was flowing and he was in an agitated or charged up state. Weyermann fled the scene with nearly $41,000. Again he ran to the vehicle from the club, that is, he was in a public place with - well, on the return journey not a loaded weapon. He assisted in disposing of evidence as directed by Powell. He participated with Powell in the creation of the ruse to establish a false alibi and the hiding of the money and the remaining clothing. Weyermann claims to Ms Robilliard his motive was to repay an $8,000 heroin debt. If so, that may have been important to him because he was using heroin within days, if not moments, of being released from prison.Further Observation41. The two offenders before me were beneficiaries of planning and reconnoitring undertaken by Bartley. Both were willing to accept his leadership, although I accept that Powell was able to assert himself as he did, when he indicated he was not interested, or did not want a robbery to occur in one place. Nonetheless, there was a daring in Weyermann’s conduct and a level of efficiency in Powell’s. The principle aggravating features I have referred to in this overview include a level of planning and preparation, whilst it was by no means meticulous or intricate planning, nor was this an opportunistic offence. There were three victims. The Crown has sought to argue the victims were vulnerable because of their employment. That would, of course, be an aggravated feature to the aggravation of number, that is, three.42. These three victims, unlike bank tellers, were not working one- out behind a till; there were other workers nearby. Any victim is vulnerable when a loaded weapon is pointed at them. That the weapon was loaded necessarily aggravates the criminality, but I do not regard the victims as falling into that category of victim recognised as frail, isolated, lacking in power before the weapon was produced.43. The offence was committed in a club where members of the public, other than direct victims, were also in danger. One of the dangers may well have sprung from somebody trying to be a hero and stop the robbery. Not all armed robberies are committed in circumstances where the public is so endangered. Likewise the journey from the car to the club with the loaded rifle had potential for public danger.44. I have mentioned Weyermann was on parole. That feature aggravates only his criminality.45. The sum captured was substantial. Most robberies are robberies that have figures of tens of dollars or hundreds of dollars. $40,000 is certainly a medium sized robbery.46. There were three persons involved in its commission. That too seems to me be an aggravating feature.47. The Crown sought to argue that the offences were aggravated because they were committed for financial gain. Almost all robberies are for some form of benefit to the robber and almost invariably benefit that can be measured in financial gain. The seriousness of this offence is already more so because of the sum taken. That is nearly $41,000 rather than forty-one dollars, which marks the offence as a more serious offence. I will not be aggravating the criminality upon the basis that it was motivated by a desire for a financial gain.48. Apart from the presentation of a loaded weapon which, in itself of course, is demonstrative of powerful violence in its own right, there does not appear to be any other behaviour, language, threats or gestures that added to what was by virtue of the weapon and demands already a tense situation. Put in another way, the violence was simply limited to the presentation of the weapon.49. While I accept that Bartley was present in the club with a loaded pistol during the robbery, at least on the facts before me, I am not satisfied that Weyermann was aware of his presence at the crime scene while the crime was ongoing until some time after the robbery had been completed. In other words, I do not find that he took any comfort from Bartley’s presence there, nor am I satisfied if things had gone “pear-shaped” that Bartley would have materialised from the crowd and contributed to Weyermann’s cause. Bartley may well have decided anonymity was his safest course.Victim Impact Statements50. I have received four victim impact statements. The material contained in the victim impact statements is not sworn evidence and has not been subject to cross-examination. To the extent if it be the case that any opinions are expressed in these statements, I recognise they are not opinions of qualified experts. Victim impact statements coming as they do from primary victims may, if I accept it as reliable, provide unsworn evidence as to the facts of the offences and their effects upon those victims.51. The functions of statements such as these is to give victims and opportunity of being heard in sentencing proceedings by publicly identifying the impact of the trauma visited upon them by actions of an offender. Secondly, to enable sentencing proceedings to assist victims as they move towards some closure or brief resentment and/or brooding arising from the criminal conduct of an offender. Thirdly victim impact statements contribute to an offender, hopefully at least hearing at first hand and gaining some insight into the impact his offending conduct had upon a victim. Finally they serve as a reminder to a court, that is to persons such as me, the impact that crime can have upon the ordinary men and women who are its victims.52. This is a victim impact statement from one of the women named Cindy Kelly: 
     
      
      “Before the armed robbery I was not a fearful person. I was not scared of the dark, I was not scared of being alone. I’m now fearful of the dark and do not like being alone. I actually go out of my way to ensure that I’m not by myself at night.  
       
       
      I used to be a happy-go-lucky sort of person, independent and sociable. Now I have an underlying anxiety and this affects different aspects of my life.  
       
       
      After the armed robbery I chose not to work Mondays. That is the day the crime happened on. I didn’t work Mondays for perhaps six months or so. I have now started working Mondays again. Whenever I work a shift at the club I always make sure that I have someone with me at the bar whilst I’m working. This could be my mum, certain customers that I know really well or friends. I’ve even taken my daughter with me and she sits in the office area of the club.  
       
       
      My favourite shows on TV were NCIS, Underbelly, Special Victims Unit and other crime related shows. Now I don’t watch them at all because of the content. What annoys me about this is that I didn’t have a choice in deciding not to watch these shows anymore, but it was decided by the effect the armed robbery has had on me.  
       
       
      I knew Grant Bartley for approximately a year before the crime. We were on friendly speaking terms. He was a nice customer. I trusted him enough that I shared personal information with him. Now I feel he used me for the information to help commit the crime. As a consequence I know I have trust issues and I’m not as friendly as I used to be in certain situations. I doubt people’s intentions, concerns and questions in general.  
       
       
      The changes in my personality and character angers, annoys and upsets me. It makes me cry. I used to enjoy how I lived my life before and I don’t like how it’s changed. The fact that the armed robbery was done four days before Christmas is heartless. Knowing that we had children and that it destroyed my Christmas. My biggest fear is that it will arise every Christmas.” 
       
      
    The second victim was Stephen Chapman. His victim impact statement contains the following: 
     
      
      “Before the armed robbery my sleeping patterns were fine and I slept soundly. After the robbery all that changed. My sleeping pattern became disturbed and it was hard to go to sleep. I would wake up every two or three hours and toss and turn. At times I would not be able to get back to sleep and would get up at 4am and stay up. This has slowly improved.  
       
       
      I was a moderate drinker prior to the robbery. After it happened I drank more to help me cope with what has happened. This lasted for about six months. During this time I also lost weight and I had three members of the club approach me and ask if I was all right health wise, as I had lost a significant amount.  
       
       
      I have been on blood pressure medication for a number of years. After this incident I wasn’t feeling myself, so I went to my doctor for a health check. My blood pressure was up. It was not stable. Consequently I have to go on a stronger dose of medicine.  
       
       
      I used to be comfortable at my work environment and was relaxed and easy-going. Now I notice that if I am by myself at the club I feel anxious and uncomfortable. When I walk down the corridor at work I am reminded of the robbery, as I saw the gunman at the front desk on the day of the robbery. He then turned around and pointed the gun at me. I get flashbacks in the corridor. I don’t like being by myself in the club.  
       
       
      Now that it’s getting closer to Christmas it brings back memories of the armed robbery which happened about two days before Christmas. I am fearful it could happen again.” 
       
      
    And the final victim is another male, Douglas Burke. He writes this: 
     
      
      “I have flashbacks that occur at any time of the day relating to the events of 22 December 2008. These flashbacks are of a gunman at my side with his gun pointed at my hip.  
       
       
      Since the traumatic event of last year I have had thoughts of role swapping with the gunman. What I mean by this is for the gunman to experience what I did. I believe that if this was possible, it would be beneficial for both parties. I also believe that this is a result of the crime and have had numerous moments of anxiety. I have felt powerless at that time because of the gun pointed at me.  
       
       
      I believe that my work has suffered in the Dubbo Railway Bowling Club. During the year I have made at least two notable accounting errors which I normally would not have made. These errors occurred not long after the robbery.  
       
       
      I have strong fears that the events may happen again in the future. Also I fear that the people involved in the armed robbery may try to search for me at the club, at home or elsewhere.  
       
       
      The relationship with my wife has changed regarding my tolerance and patience with her. I feel little things at home appear to annoy me more than before the events of last year. This is the first time I have spoken about the events of last year to anyone in great length.” 
       
      
    Subjective Matters53. I now turn to the subjective factors. I am both entitled and required to do that. As I said earlier, not only am I sentencing for the criminal offence, but I am also sentencing each offender for it. Each offender coming before the court varies from others who stand or who have stood for sentences. Circumstances personal to an offender may offer to a court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by an offender or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate in each case.54. I deal firstly with Jonathan Powell.Background, Family and Relationships55. Powell is a single man aged twenty-one living with his parents and nine siblings in the Dubbo region. His parents sought to raise him to behave in a “Godly way”. To this end, corporal punishment was used in the form of a strap administered by either parent when thought appropriate.56. The father suffered anxiety and depression to a point of incapacitation for about five years during Powell’s teenage years. The father believes that this incapacity extended to the performance of his role as a parent.57. Powell spent his school years feeling isolated and rejected by his peers who he claims bullied him. The school was informed on occasions, which invariably, Powell says, backfired on him. The focus of bullying is said to have centred on name-calling, problems about his red hair, his large family and in later years amounted to hitting him and pushing him against walls.58. He told a treating psychologist that he attended subsequent to this offence he has poor relationship and low attachment with his family. He finds it difficult to have a sensible talk with his father or other family members. While he lives on the parents’ property, he is away from the main house in what is called a relocatable sheet metal office building. To avoid arguments he has minimal contact with the family.59. In more recent times he has struck up with a friendship with a young lady named Sharna, who as I understand he also met while working at the abattoirs. He describes her as his fiancée. They met some time around July or August of 2009.Education, Skills and Employment60. He was educated at the Dubbo Christian School to Year 10 standard. He says he was an above average student. He said he left because he was unhappy at school. Last year he was doing what appears to be three days per week TAFE course. That is what he told Gary Black, the treating psychologist, which I assume to be Certificate II in meat processing. He also holds a Certificate II in hospitality. Both of these courses may give some insight into his TAFE interests. He attends bible study through the week.61. Since leaving school he held an apprenticeship at ATS Screen Printing in a printer and embroidery business. The apprenticeship was abandoned when his employer refused to pay him. Then he worked at Fletcher International Exports for eight months. That followed with a period of employment by Jimmy Chang(?) at Jimmy’s Kitchen, a Dubbo Chinese restaurant where he has worked from October 2006 to some time in 2009. It seems that would have finished before July of 2009.62. In his evidence Powell described himself as currently a job seeker. He currently is registered with an unemployment agency and actively seeking other work. His last position was at the local abattoir. His departure was mutually agreed when both he and his employer determined he was unsuitable for this kind of work.General Health63. In 2009 Powell had a severe lung infection. He is a tall man at 192 centimetres in height and weighing 108 kilograms. Apparently he has lost some thirty kilos. I have no doubt he is the healthier for that. Otherwise he appears in good physical health.Mental Health Issues64. Sam Borenstein, clinical psychologist retained by the defence, diagnoses compromised self-esteem, low levels of consequence subsequent to being bullied. He presents to the Court as isolated from family and peers, more so since his arrest. Borenstein describes him as naïve. Others also use that term, however, I do not find him to be so. 65. Borenstein opines Powell has a desire for emotional recognition and friendship which overrode his judgment. In my view that is likely in respect of his relationship with Bartley. So far as his relationship with Weyermann, it is likely Powell is the leader of those two.66. An interesting insight into his personality is to be found in the contradictions which emerge from the psychological reports before me. For example, my sense is that he sought to leave Borenstein with the impression that he requires speech therapy for a stutter, which I have no doubt he has, when he was a child and that he received that therapy. He is still a stutterer and when he saw Gary Black he made clear to Black that he had received no speech therapy treatment. He told Black he did not get along well with his father or family. He told Borenstein he got along well with his family, save for a sister, the second eldest in the family. He told his father, “I had three good friends. Now I have one and that is you, dad”.67. Gary Black notes a comparison and improvement in scores for anxiety and stress between the second and sixth counselling sessions, noting they were now in the normal range, while the depression score remained moderate. Powell’s own assessment of the six sessions with Gary Black is that he “is uncertain” as to its benefit. I accept Borenstein’s opinion that Powell’s thought processes and contents are normal, but there seems to me much inconsistency in the history he is giving to various people or the messages that he is giving to various people.68. Borenstein comes to a view that there is no suggestion of any serious psychosis or perceptual disturbance and that Powell is cognitively in tact, in which case those inconsistencies become the more disturbing.Character and Reputation69. He is a young man approaching his twenty-second birthday, isolated, a past good work ethic, searching for emotional commitment from his peers and possibly his parents. He appears to have an emotional commitment from Sharna. He is inclined to see the fault in others.70. He regards himself as a Christian and takes his commitment, at least superficially, seriously. To this religion he appears to be serious and claims adherence to its values, although when he falls short of them, for example, in the offence before me, it is usually someone else’s fault.71. He would appear to be someone who is not without courage.... 72. He has no prior interaction with the police or the criminal law. He is, for the purposes of the law, a person of good character. Each of his four referees said the offence was out of character for him. Although fairly young, his record would seem to confirm that. He is described by his referees in terms such as “quiet”, “polite”, “respectful”, “not given to excessive language”, “befriends others”- for a man who is isolated, I cannot quite follow that- “easy”, “God-fearing”, “gentle”, “earnest”, “well-meaning”- again in the circumstances of this offence I find that difficult to accept- and “remorseful”.Attitude to the Offence73. His claim to Gary Black was that he was experiencing post traumatic stress disorder type symptoms, burning in his chest, panic attacks, nightmares and recurring flashes about the robbery. He said trigger words set him off. He claims a strong remorse and disgust at his involvement in the robbery. I accept that he does now, against his values.74. He acknowledges his involvement clashed with a number of his religious beliefs. He has pleaded guilty to the charge from the outset, although he has minimised and shifted responsibility for the criminal conduct wherever he could.75. His claims of threats and fear of Bartley are in my view as false as the performance before his father on the day of his arrest... When confronted by police he cooperated immediately with them, knowing that to do so would put him offside with Bartley. His cooperation facilitated, it is said, recovery of the cheques taken - my understanding was that all of that was found by the father - clothing and rifle used and identification of three particular pants. That is the view of the police. In a statement to police he has sought to identify the role of each offender. For the purposes of this hearing I find he has sought to minimise his criminality.76. He also sought to reshape his relationship with Bartley by exaggerating or creating threats and acts causing fear and duress as his motivator for continuing in the relationship with Bartley and sole motivator of his involvement with him in the robbery.77. .....78. ....79. .... I ... give a twenty-five per cent discount on the sentence I otherwise would have set but for the plea of guilty and remorse. I must have upped that five per cent. I must have upped that to ten per cent in light of the overall result. I will change that now. 80. In all, the total discount will be one of forty-five per cent. Rehabilitation Prospects81. Theoretically Powel’s rehabilitation prospects should be very good. He is not, so far as is known, addicted to drink or drugs. Although he has trouble holding a job down for any real length of time he does appear to have a good work ethic. His religious values reject violence and anti-social conduct. His family are supportive of him notwithstanding tensions that exist between them, and he now has a fiancée, Sharma, who has no issues with the criminal law and every interest in his successful life ahead. He has good health. His mental health is basically intact although there are issues to be addressed. In the fifteen months since this offence there has been no further offending. On the other hand, he seems not to understand the need for honesty, frankness and commitment when working with a counsellor for the purposes of rehabilitation. To his credit he did attend all counselling sessions and that counts as a positive for his rehabilitation, but while he continues to blame others he cannot heal himself. Borenstein sees him as in need of further counselling. In its absence his chances of re-offending are engorged.Subjective Features for Chade Samuel WeyermannRelationship, Family Background82. Sam Weyermann is of Thai origin and birth. He was adopted by Swiss parents at the age of two. Martin Weyermann travelled to Thailand to adopt him. The home environment was stable. His mother is a nurse, although now retired. Initially the family resided in Switzerland and later migrated to Australia when Weyermann was thirteen or fourteen. I think I was told in evidence he was thirteen and a half. Weyermann is now twenty-three and single. Weyermann had behavioural issues as a child. The family live in the Mudgee region, close to extended family, as I understand it, where he was located when Powell recruited him. 83. In Weyermann’s mid to late teenage years he moved to Sydney and for a period contact with the family virtually ceased. He later moved to Dubbo where he formed an unstable relationship with a woman called Jackie. There were serious issues of domestic violence towards both Jackie and her family. There is one child, a son, from this relationship, now living in another State. It would appear Weyermann has lost contact with the child. His mother has maintained contact with Weyermann whilst he has been in custody and my sense is that there was contact re-established when Weyermann returned to Dubbo.84. Weyermann has been to Thailand in an unsuccessful attempt to find his biological parents and it would seem to me received a fairly unsatisfactory explanation or insight into how it came to be that he was put up for adoption.Education, Employment and Skills85. Sam Weyermann’s early education was in Switzerland. Some of it at boarding school with a view to placing limitations on his behaviour. In Mudgee he attended St Mathews College but left that school rather than be expelled. He then went to Year 11 at Gulgong High School but by that time his behaviour was rebellious and unsettled and there were instances of drug abuse. His attendance was not good and he was smoking cannabis at the school. He left that school rather than be expelled. Again to his credit he tried unsuccessfully to complete Year 12 at TAFE. 86. He was employed at the Dubbo abattoirs and it was there, I sense, that he met Powell. That employment was not for a long period and he left, he says, on the promise of a better position which never eventuated. His time at the abattoirs represents his total work experience. He appears to have survived since his mid teenage years and paid for drug use and for a heavy gambling commitment, at least in later years, by apparently undetected criminal activity.General Health87. He presents in court as a fit, young man. He has, he says, been hit over the head with an iron bar during a “bar fight”. He has also had a couple of fits. Whether the fits are some response to neurological trauma as a consequence of the iron bar or the side effects of drug abuse is unknown, but in my view should be investigated. He suffers from a dermatitis condition that flares up from time to time. He has two hospitalisations whilst in custody. One of them at a time when he had tonsillitis. Mental Health Issues88. He is on anti-psychotic medication. It seems he had an attention deficit disorder and hyperactivity as a child that has persisted into adulthood. Ms Robilliard, retained by the defence, sees his behavioural history as consistent with a diagnosis of conduct disorder followed by anti-social personality disorder. Both he and his mother use the term “rebellious” to describe his emerging personality as a child and during his mid to teenage years. He has given a history to Dr Henderson, who saw him in custody in 2007, of auditory hallucinations and having grandiose themes. Whether those grandiose themes have touched upon any of the other history he has given I am unsure, but it seems to me likely, given his absence of income and some of the material I will come to in a minute.89. During the course of Powell’s evidence, Powell was cross-examined by Ms Robinson, counsel for Weyermann, on the closeness of the relationship between the two co-offenders. During that cross-examination I observed Weyermann to become teary and distressed of being reminded of the closeness of that past association. I am satisfied that relationship was very important to Weyermann. Powell had visited him in prison on a number of occasions. It is likely Powell was a most significant person for Weyermann and probably his most significant peer. The imploding of that friendship will add to the significant persons who have been lost to Weyermann. They include his biological parents, possibly his father, Jackie and his child. Although not diagnosed, I suspect an anger arising from a reactive depression consequence upon those losses and his present incarceration. However, he has been diagnosed by Professor David Greenberg with a poly-substance disorder, an alcohol dependence disorder, and the diagnosis of anti-social personality disorder has been confirmed and a possible schizo-effective disorder arising from the hearing of voices. That schizo-effective disorder is likely to be a drug induced illness as a consequence of his cannabis abuse. His mental health issues present as a serious ongoing negative factor to his rehabilitation prospects. Alcohol, Drugs and Gambling 90. He reports a gambling addiction of up to $9,000 per week on pokermachines. As I said a moment ago, I find a $9,000 per week gambling addition, in the absence of any income stream, per week, as being extraordinarily high. I cannot say it is wrong, but the undetected criminal activity need to support that would have to have been monumental. He began drinking soon after commencing high school. His alcohol intake was costing him a hundred dollars per week. His drink of choice appears to be vodka and vodka mixes. He was smoking cannabis aged fourteen as a relaxer. He still likes to smoke it because it helps him to sleep. It would appear he does not understand the toxicity of cannabis build up in a body, causing paranoia, aggression and mental health problems, including, in my view, auditory hallucinations.91. After arriving in Sydney, Weyermann went clubbing nightly. He was using heroin intravenously and ecstasy as well. When arrested for this offence - bear in mind he had only been out ten days, I think - he had resumed cannabis, heroin at four caps, and alcohol, daily. His drug and alcohol abuse are becoming long term. They appear to be well entrenched addictions and pose major obstacles for him in his rehabilitation progress. Character92. Sam Weyermann is a young twenty-three year old man falling in the below to average range of intelligence, who appears unable to function lawfully or effectively in the community. He is not without insight in regard to his condition but seems to prefer the risk taking lifestyle that marked his recent years. He has just finished a ten month minimum term and was unable to last three weeks on parole before re-offending. That last period of custody came ten days after an earlier period of custody, as will be seen later. 93. His criminal history commences in May 2006 with a common assault. He has a range of criminal offences on his record, including driving matters, common assaults, goods in custody, use of a weapon with intent to commit an indictable offence, further assaults and breach of apprehended violence order charges. Those later assaults and the breach of apprehended violence orders relate to a turbulent and unstable relationship with Jackie and her extended family. That is not to excuse them, but rather to confine them to a period. They are nonetheless criminal behaviour for which he is responsible.Rehabilitation Prospects94. Absent some intense rehabilitation therapy and oversight he appears at high risk of re-offending. There are drug, alcohol, gambling addictions, requiring criminal activity for their survival and no indication that he does not want them to survive. There are mental health issues desperately needing addressing and maybe fuelling his rebellious pre-disposition. There is an impoverishment of employment skills and work ethic. Apart from his mother there now appears to be an absence of a stable significant person in his world. He is in a custodial setting which is contraindicated as a force for rehabilitation. Attitude to Offence95. He has pleaded guilty from the outset. He claims remorse and has backed that up with a note that he has written to the court. That note is in these terms: 
     
      
      “My name is Samuel Chade Weyermann, born 21/08/86. What I have done today I still can’t explain. I am blessed no one got hurt and I wish I could apologise personally to the people involved, staff, bartender, et cetera. I take full responsibility for what I have done today, including all the people I put in danger. I would like to ask your Honour that what I did I did myself as stupid as I was I did myself.” 
       
      
    I find he has insight. I find that he is sorry and remorseful. I am concerned whether that remorsefulness will convert to rehabilitation. Nonetheless I intend to give him a twenty five per cent discount on the sentence I otherwise would have set for his early plea of guilty and his contrition.Setting the Sentence Deterrence96. Robberies using loaded weapons constitute a serious offence. Sentencing for these offences must be set against a background that one aim of sentencing is to deter would be offenders. Parliament sets maximum sentences with deterrence very much in mind. This offence carries a maximum sentence of twenty-five years imprisonment. Of the 250 persons sentenced for this offence since December of 2009 only fifteen have avoided the gaol walls. The remaining 235 have been sentenced to terms of incarceration ranging from eighteen months to sixteen years. The objective seriousness of this offence is such that punishment of such severity is called for, that is the harshest form of punishment known to the law is to be harnessed in this case. Powell’s role in the actual offence is substantially less than Weyermann’s. However his role in the planning, provedoring before and covering up after are greater than Weyermann's.97. Overall Weyermann’s criminality in brandishing the weapon, actually causing the fear and threat from the lethal violence is greater than Powell’s. Powell’s subjective circumstances, particularly his prior good character and ... and prosecution are more favourable than Weyermann’s. These differences will be reflected in both the starting figures and the ultimate outcome. But for his plea of guilty I would have set an overall sentence for Weyermann of six years imprisonment. That figure is discounted by twenty five per cent for the utilitarian value of the plea and the remorse, making the overall reduced sentence one of four and a half years. In his case I find special circumstances. But for ten days, if I have got the right figure, he has been in continuous custody since 14 July 2008. Prior to that date he had been released from custody on 4 July 2008 against an earlier admission of 5 December 2007. Thus but for two small breaks of about nine or ten days each he has been in continuous custody since 5 December 2007. I note that because of his youth at twenty three his character and maturity are still forming. It is better if he can rehabilitate to do so in the community. Mr Weyermann would you just stand up for a moment please while I sentence you.Formal Orders98. Chade Samuel Weyermann, you are convicted, that you on 22 December 2008 at Dubbo did rob Douglas Bourke of certain property, namely $40,929.30 in Australian currency and cheque, the property of the Dubbo Railway Bowling Club Limited whilst you were armed with a dangerous weapon, namely a .22 sawn off unique brand pump action rifle. For that offence I set a non-parole period of two years, to date from 13 April 2009 and to expire on 12 April 2011. I set a balance of term of two and a half years, to expire on 12 October 2013. Your first eligible date for release to parole is 12 April next year. You have to persuade the Parole Board, I cannot order your parole. You have to persuade the Parole Board of two things, that you are not a danger to yourself and that you are not a danger to any other person in the community. If you do not do that you will not be granted parole the first time you go. I do not know whether you know this or not but if you are not granted parole on the first occasion you go there you will have to wait twelve months before you can go again. What you need to do is to concentrate on getting out on the first parole date by doing all you can to demonstrate to all the people around the gaol that you are rehabilitated. Do you understand that? Right. 99. If you do not you will stay in for another twelve months and at the end of that twelve month period if you do not convince them that you are not a danger to yourself and not a danger to others, if you do not convince them of that you will be in for another twelve months. So you could, in theory, end up serving that whole four and a half years. The person who will make that decision really at the end of the day is you not them. If you go in there with good credentials they must give you parole. I will come to the breach of bond in a moment.100. Jonathan Powell, but for your plea of guilty and assistance to police I would have set a sentence of four years imprisonment. I reduce that sentence by forty-five per cent on account of your plea of guilty .... That reduces that original four year sentence to one of 26.4 months. That is two years, two and a half months. ... I have determined nonetheless to reduce it to one of twenty-four months so that I can suspend the sentence. I do that bearing in mind rehabilitation is a factor that should be given extra weight in setting a sentence for a young man if it is at all possible. 101. .... 102. .....103. I decline at this point to set a non-parole period. 104. Would you stand up please. Jonathan Alan Powell you are convicted that you, on the twenty-second day of December 2008, at Dubbo, did rob Douglas Burke of certain property, namely $40,929.30 in Australian currency and cheque, the property of Dubbo Railway Bowling Club, whilst being armed with a dangerous weapon, to wit, a .22 calibre sawn-off Unique brand pump action rifle.105. In respect of that offence I set a term of imprisonment of two years. 106. Pursuant to s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act, conditional upon you entering into a bond to be of good behaviour, I suspend the operation of that sentence. 107. The bond will have as its condition that you will be supervised by Probation and Parole and that you attend such counselling, treatment, management and programs as required by them, including, if you have not yet got employment, a program related to the personal support for people who are unemployed. That program is run by any Commonwealth based employment agency.108. Mr Weyermann I need to come back to you. Your conviction and sentence has resulted in your being in breach of a good behaviour bond given to you by Judge Wood, as I understand it, in response to an appeal that you lodged against a conviction of 13 August 2008. You were given a s 9 bond to be of good behaviour for eighteen months. The offence I have just dealt with amounts to a breach of that. 109. In respect of that offence, the term of imprisonment originally imposed by the Magistrate will be restored. That is to say a term of twelve months imprisonment with nine months non-parole to date from 13 April 2009, the non-parole period to expire on 12 January 2010 and the balance of term to expire on 13 April 2010. The sentence is entirely concurrent with the sentence that I have just given you, no more time to serve. I do that because the Crown in his submissions did not ask for any further period of incarceration.110. In respect of a firearm offence, a 166 offence, on the application of the Crown that charge is dismissed.111. Any further matter Mr Crown?[Discussion between His Honour and Legal Representatives]112. I remand Mr Powell into your custody Mr Hockey. The reason for that is you are a sentenced prisoner at the moment, conditional upon you entering the bond. You do not enter the bond, you go through the door. So you enter the bond and you keep it. If you do not keep the bond, you come back and go through the door.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 HODGSON JA: The proceedings giving rise to this appeal arose out of an accident that occurred at Wallgrove Quarry on 4 June 2002. At that time, the first respondent (the plaintiff) was employed by a labour hire company Adecco Industrial Pty Limited (Adecco), and was seconded by Adecco to work for the appellant (Hanson) driving a truck supplied by Hanson. The accident occurred when a front-end loader operated by the second respondent (Pioneer) reversed into the truck while the plaintiff was in the driver’s seat. The plaintiff sued Hanson and Pioneer, and each defendant cross-claimed for contribution from the other. Pioneer admitted liability.  
     
      
    2 On 3 October 2008, Delaney DCJ gave his decision, in which he found that Hanson and Pioneer were negligent, that the plaintiff was not guilty of contributory negligence, that Adecco was negligent to the extent of 20 per cent, and that there would be a verdict for each defendant on its cross-claim to the extent of 50 per cent; and he assessed damages against Hanson at $576,484.41 and against Pioneer at $421,984.41.  
     
      
    3 Following calculation of adjustments required by s 151Z of the Workers Compensation Act 1987 consequent on the finding of negligence to the extent of 20 per cent against Adecco, the following orders were made on 27 November 2008:  
     
      
       
        
        1. Verdict and judgment for the Plaintiff as against the First Defendant Hanson Construction Materials, in the amount of $461,187.53.  
         
         
        2. Verdict and judgment for the Plaintiff as against the Second Defendant, Pioneer Road Services Pty Limited, in the amount of $337,587.53.  
         
         
        3. The Defendants are granted leave to file Cross Claims against each other relying on section 5 of the  
        Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 
         1946.  
         
         
        4. Verdict and judgment for the First Defendant against the Second Defendant (cross defendant to the cross claim brought by the First Defendant) in the amount of $230,593.76.  
         
         
        5. Verdict and judgment for the Second Defendant against the First Defendant (cross defendant to the cross claim brought by the Second Defendant) in the amount of $168,793.76.  
         
         
        6. No order as to the costs of the cross claims.  
         
         
        7. First and Second Defendants to pay in equal shares the Plaintiffs costs as agreed or assessed.  
         
         
        8. Declaration that any satisfaction by the First Defendant of Order 1 will pro tanto satisfy Order 2 and any satisfaction by the Second Defendant of Order 2 will pro tanto satisfy order 1.  
        
       
      
    4 Hanson has appealed from those orders. The plaintiff has put on a cross-appeal seeking a re-assessment of damages for future economic loss. Pioneer has also put on a cross-appeal, seeking re-assessment of damages.  
     
      
       
      Circumstances  
      
    5 The plaintiff was 40 years old at the time of the trial.  
     
      
    6 In April 2002, he was employed by Adecco, and was hired out to Hanson.  
     
      
    7 Over the following weeks, the plaintiff drove a truck supplied by Hanson carrying aggregate and metal from the Bass Point quarry to various locations in Sydney. One site to which he frequently delivered road base and aggregate material was Wallgrove Quarry, which he visited about five to ten times a week for the two months prior to the accident.  
     
      
    8 Between 11 pm and 12 pm on the evening of 4 June 2002, the plaintiff drove his vehicle into Wallgrove Quarry and stopped. There were two front-end loaders operating in the quarry. One of them, owned and operated by Pioneer and driven by its employee Mr Saliba, reversed into the passenger side of the plaintiff’s truck, injuring the plaintiff.  
     
      
       
      Proceedings in the District Court  
      
    9 The plaintiff’s statement of claim (as amended) alleged that Hanson was the owner and/or occupier of the quarry, and alleged vicarious liability for the negligence of the driver of the front-end loader against both defendants. The statement of claim also alleged negligence against Hanson as owner and/or occupier of the quarry, in failing to take proper precautions for the plaintiff’s safety.  
     
      
    10 At the trial, the plaintiff gave evidence that he was given no instructions other than to get into the truck and drive it to the quarry and unload some metal. He gave evidence that, when he stopped the truck in the position where it was hit, Mr Saliba’s front-end loader was about 30 metres away. The loader then reversed towards the plaintiff’s truck, and when the plaintiff observed this, he sounded his horn; but the loader did not stop. This evidence was accepted by the primary judge.  
     
      
    11 There was no witness called for either defendant. However, a safety/environment incident report was admitted into evidence, apparently prepared shortly after the accident by an employee of Pioneer. This report gave the following account of what happened:  
     
      
       
        
        Asphalt plant working both day and night shift. Charlie was on night work driving front-end loader and was filling cold feed bins. He had dumped a bucket of sand into the bin and was reversing down the ramp. As he reversed he looked into rear vision mirror and saw nothing. A few seconds later he heard a horn sounding. He immediately applied the brakes and before coming to a halt the rear of the loader collided with the left-hand side front drive axel of a truck and dog trailer. Charlie estimates approximately two seconds elapsed between hearing horn and impact.  
        
       
      
    12 The “Charlie” referred to in that report was Mr Saliba; and Mr Saliba apparently signed the document to confirm that this was an accurate description of the events.  
     
      
    13 The Report also contained the following note:  
     
      
       
        
        Majority of raw material deliveries are made at night. When asphalt plant is open at night normal practice has been for aggregate delivery vehicles to pull up at RAP stockpile and wait for recognition from loader before proceeding. Driver in question was casual and may not have been aware of accepted practice. Driver has been recently hired by Pioneer Transport as a casual.  
        
       
      
    14 The Report recommended that a system be formalised for the entry of trucks into the stockpile area while the asphalt plant was working. A prominent sign was subsequently erected near the entrance to the quarry, in the following terms:  
     
      
       
        
        STOP – If front-end loader (F.E.L.) is working ahead make contact with F.E.L. operator via CB channel 27. Do not proceed into area until you have been instructed to do so.  
        
       
      
    15 It was not established at the hearing that Hanson was owner or occupier of the quarry; and photographs of signs near the approach to the quarry could have supported an inference that Pioneer was. However, Pioneer having admitted liability, it was not suggested to the primary judge that this was on any basis other than vicarious liability for the driver’s negligence. On the other hand, as against Hanson, it was put to the primary judge that Hanson had a duty of care as a “host employee” in accordance with cases such as TNT Australia Pty Limited v Christie [2003] NSWCA 47; (2003) 65 NSWLR 1. No point was taken before the primary judge or before the Court of Appeal that this was outside the pleadings.  
     
      
       
      Decision of primary judge  
      
    16 The primary judge held (par [11]) that Adecco had placed the plaintiff under the total control of Hanson; and that, in accordance with Christie, Hanson had an obligation to provide the plaintiff with a safe place and safe system of work. He held (par [12]) that the quarry was not safe, because Mr Saliba did not know the plaintiff was there, and the plaintiff had not been given any instructions or told that any system had been provided to him to notify workers at the quarry of his arrival. He held (par [14]) that providing a system of notice, or advising the plaintiff what he should do, was within the range of inexpensive options that could have been adopted by Hanson.  
     
      
    17 The primary judge also held (par [15]-[16]) that a reasonable inference from the Report was that there was a system in place that required notice to be given to the loader driver, but that Hanson gave no notice of that practice to the plaintiff.  
     
      
    18 Accordingly, the primary judge found Hanson as well as Pioneer liable in negligence.  
     
      
    19 The primary judge found Adecco also liable, to the extent of 20 per cent. As between Hanson and Pioneer, the primary judge decided (at [26]) “that the obligations that each owed to the plaintiff was such that the percentage each defendant should bear is 50 per cent.”  
     
      
    20 On damages, the primary judge made the following findings, which are not challenged on appeal:  
     
      
       
        
        Findings on the medical evidence  
         
         
        39. A review of this medical evidence leads me to find the following facts:  
         
         
        (1) At the date of accident the plaintiff had asymptomatic pre-existing degenerative changes of minor degree in the lumbar spine.  
         
         
        (2) That in the accident he aggravated these pre-existing degenerative changes and they became symptomatic.  
         
         
        (3) He sustained an annular tear at L5/S1 which has caused continuous pain and restricted movement.  
         
         
        (4) As a consequence of the above injuries he has experienced referred pain into the legs.  
         
         
        (5) He is now unfit for the range of tasks referred to in the report of Dr Deveridge.  
         
         
        (6) The pain, discomfort, restriction of movement and restricted work capacity are permanent.  
         
         
        (7) Although operative treatment is possible, it is unlikely and the most likely future treatment will be conservative treatment by way of strengthening exercises and some physiotherapy or hydrotherapy.  
         
         
        Findings as to the effect of the accident on the plaintiff's employment  
         
         
        40. I also find the following facts about his employment history and the effect of the accident on his work capacity:  
         
         
        (1) After leaving school in New Zealand he worked with his father on a farm and drove small vehicles transporting animals.  
         
         
        (2) After his arrival in Australia he obtained employment driving trucks and has done so all his working life since then.  
         
         
        (3) That before the accident of 4 June 2002 he was fit to drive trucks on an unrestricted basis, particularly the type of heavy vehicle provided for him by Hanson.  
         
         
        (4) As a consequence of the accident he is no longer fit to work full-time as a truck driver due to continuing back pain and restricted movement. He cannot drive for long periods of time. This means he cannot do his pre-accident job.  
         
         
        (5) He has an ability to drive trucks on a restricted basis. Such restriction means that he not be on the road for too long at any one time. If he only drives for short periods over short distances the aggravating effect on his lower back is less and he can work.  
         
         
        (6) The degenerative changes in his back will progress slowly and it is unlikely he will be able to continue work as a truck driver through to age 65.  
         
         
        (7) He has the opportunity to work overtime in his present job with Multiserv, but additional hours of work are contra-indicated because of medical opinion and his own experience.  
         
         
        (8) Although the evidence about this was ambiguous it is possible that Multiserv may not continue to have its current contract with BHP under which the plaintiff is presently employed as a permanent driver. Should this happen, and he is thrown on the open labour market to obtain work through labour hire companies then his earning capacity would clearly be restricted because of his accident-induced disability.  
        
       
      
    21 The primary judge found that at the time of the accident the plaintiff was capable of earning up to $800 net per week, depending on the number of hours he was called in to work. After the accident, because of back pain, it was increasingly difficult for the plaintiff to face constant driving on the open road. However, he was able to obtain employment with Multiserv. His employment with Multiserv required the plaintiff to drive no more than seven kilometres on any one journey and on some days hardly at all. Nonetheless he received a gross wage of approximately $1,440 net per week, substantially more than he was earning at the date of the accident.22 The primary judge noted that the plaintiff’s claim against Hanson was to be determined under the Civil Liability Act 2002, while his claim against Pioneer was under the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 (with the consequence that the plaintiff could not recover non-economic loss against Pioneer).  
     
      
    23 The primary judge assessed the injuries and disabilities of the plaintiff at 35 per cent of a most extreme case, translating to $154,500.  
     
      
    24 He allowed past medical expenses of $29,569.41, and future expenses of $15,000.  
     
      
    25 As regards past economic loss, the primary judge took a figure of $700 net per week, and applied it to the period from the accident to 18 July 2004 (110 weeks), at the end of which the plaintiff commenced employment with Multiserv NSW Pty Limited. To this he added $8,500 for lost opportunity to work overtime with Multiserv, giving $85,500.  
     
      
    26 As regards future economic loss, the primary judge made the following findings:  
     
      
       
        
        56. The plaintiff called Mr McDonald from BHP to give evidence about the duration of its contract with Multiserve as the plaintiff contended it was likely to end soon and he could lose his job.  
         
         
        57. The evidence about this potential loss was ambiguous. The plaintiff had said that he drove a tanker. This tanker had solid waste which it loaded and unloaded. This appeared to be work that was connected with the contract that Mr Macdonald said had 10 years to run rather than the contract that was to be renegotiated in October this year. In my opinion, the plaintiff has not established on the balance of probabilities that the contract will be lost and/or that he will necessarily lose his job at Multiserv without being able to obtain, as a permanent employee, alternative work. No one from Multiserv was called about this.  
         
         
        58. As an alternative, the plaintiff claimed a reduction of earning capacity on the open labour market pitched at $500 net per week. In this regard it was important to note that he now earns significantly more than it is likely he would have earned if he had not been injured and in my opinion this establishes his current earning capacity. I find that it is not likely the plaintiff will have this job until he is 65 and may find he has to take less remunerative jobs from time to time.  
        
       
      
    27 The primary judge found the plaintiff’s current earning capacity to be approximately $75,000 net per annum; and found that the plaintiff had lost “a significant degree of that capacity”, and allowed him $400 net per week to age 65 less 20 per cent for contingencies, giving $241,000.  
     
      
    28 To the figures for past and future economic loss, the primary judge added superannuation of 11 per cent, giving $9,405 and $26,570 respectively.  
     
      
    29 In addition, the primary judge made an allowance for house maintenance now beyond the plaintiff, allowing future costs of this and any other assistance required for mowing at two hours per month at $30 per hour, giving $15,000.  
     
      
       
      Issues on appeal  
      
    30 Hanson relies on the following grounds of appeal:  
     
      
       
        
        1 His Honour erred in finding that the Appellant duty of care was to ensure the safety of the First Respondent and in failing to find that the obligation on the Appellant was to exercise reasonable care for the safety of the First Respondent [12].  
         
         
        2 His Honour erred in concluding that the Appellant was in breach of its duty of care to the First Respondent because it failed to install at the gate to the quarry a telephone by which the First Respondent could be connected to the driver of the front end loader [13].  
         
         
        3 His Honour erred in concluding that the Appellant was in breach of its duty of care to the First Respondent because it had failed to provide a system of notice and to advise the First Respondent of what he should do. [14]  
         
         
        4 His Honour was in error in failing to find the content of an appropriate notice and/or instruction(s) the Appellant should have given and failed to find the manner, means and circumstances by which such notice and or instruction this should have been communicated to the First Respondent and/or the second respondent. [14]  
         
         
        5 His Honour erred in concluding that the Appellant could and should have installed a light on the loader and formalised a system of entry to the stockpile area. [18]  
         
         
        6 His Honour erred in concluding that any breach of its duty of care owed to the First Respondent by the Appellant was a cause of the injuries to the First Respondent.  
         
         
        7 His Honour erred in failing to discount the verdict in favour of the First Respondent for contributory negligence in circumstances where His Honour found the First Respondent had been to the quarry many times before the accident; that on the occasion of the accident he was aware of the front end loader working there; that he had not made contact with the front end loader driver or any other personnel at the site to warn of his presence and had stopped his truck at the bottom of the ramp on which the loader was working. [20]  
         
         
        8 His Honour erred in apportioning liability between the Appellant and the Second Respondent equally in that he wrongly concluded against the Appellant that it could and should have:  
         
         
         (i) installed a telephone at the gate to the quarry for the purpose of communication between the First Respondent and the employees of the Second Respondent, including the loader driver; [13]  
          
          
         (ii) installed lighting on the loader; [18]  
          
          
         (iii) devised a procedure whereby the presence of the First Respondent would come to the notice of employees of the Second Respondent including, inter alia, the driver of the low loader; [19]  
          
          
         (iv) influenced activities at the quarry whereas the site and its operations were controlled by the second respondent. [19]  
         
         
        9 The amount allowed for non-economic loss was excessive and beyond an appropriate discretionary range. The Appellant submits that the allowance should have been no more than 20% of a most extreme case. [42]  
         
         
        10 The amount allowed for future economic loss ($241,000) calculated as a loss of $400 per week for the remainder of the First Respondent's working life was excessive having regard to the findings made by His Honour that:  
         
         
         (i) at the time of the accident the Plaintiff’s capacity to earn was $700 net per week driving a truck; [51]  
          
          
         (ii) the First Respondent did not on the balance of probabilities establish that the contract on which he was then employed would be lost or that he would lose his current employment and be unable to find alternative permanent employment; [57]  
          
          
         (iii) the First Respondent was earning significantly more than he was likely to earn had he not been injured; [58]  
          
          
         (iv) the First Respondent's current earnings established his earning capacity in the sum of $1,442 net per week. [58][59]  
         
         
        11 His Honour was in error in allowing the sum of $85,500 for past economic loss including $8,500 for lost opportunity to do overtime:  
         
         
         (i) when the First Respondent was in fact working 48 hours per week; [34]  
          
          
         (ii) His Honour failed to account for wages received by the Plaintiff after the accident and before 18 July 2004 in the sum of $22,235.90.  
         
         
        12 His Honour was in error in allowing any amount for domestic assistance. [60]  
        
       
      
    31 The plaintiff relies on the following grounds for his cross-appeal:  
     
      
       
        
        1. His Honour erred in finding that the cross-appellant, as at the date of the trial, drove a tanker vehicle in connection with a contract between his employer Multiserve and Bluescope Steel for the loading and unloading of solid waste, which contract had 10 years to run [57].  
         
         
        2. His Honour erred in failing to find on the evidence that the plaintiff, since being employed with Multiserve was employed to drive vehicles transporting scrap metal, which contract was due to expire in October 2009 and for which Bluescope Steel had called for and received three tenders and had not invited any tender from Multiserve. His Honour ought to have found that it was not likely that Multiserve would be successful in obtaining that contract which would put at risk the cross appellant's employment with Multiserve.  
         
         
        3. His Honour erred in failing to take into consideration the matters referred to in Ground 2 above in determining the value of the cross-appellant's loss of earning capacity and future economic loss.  
         
         
        4. His Honour erred in finding that the cross-appellant had not established on the balance of probabilities that the cross-appellant would necessarily lose his job at Multiserve without being able to obtain, as a permanent employee, alternative work [57].  
         
         
        5. His Honour erred in failing to assess future economic loss by reference to a higher figure for loss of capacity to earn than that utilised by his Honour [59].  
         
         
        6. His Honour erred in departing from utilising the normal 15% for vicissitudes when assessing the award for future economic loss [59].  
        
       
      
    32 For its cross-appeal, Pioneer relies on grounds the same as or substantially similar to grounds 7 and 10-12 of the grounds relied on by Hanson.  
     
      
    33 I will consider in turn the following issues:  
     
      
      (1) the liability of Hanson;  
      (2) contributory negligence;  
      (3) apportionment between Hanson and Pioneer;  
      (4) non-economic loss;  
      (5) past economic loss;  
      (6) future economic loss;  
      (7) domestic assistance. Liability of Hanson  
      
    34 The following submissions were made for Hanson:  
     
      
      (1) The primary judge erred in expressing Hanson’s duty as a duty to ensure the safety of the plaintiff, rather than to exercise reasonable care for his safety; and this materially affected his decision.  
      (2) The primary judge erred in holding that the accident occurred because there was no system in place whereby the plaintiff would notify the driver of the loader of his presence, when in fact it occurred because of the plaintiff’s failure to stop his truck in a safe place and the loader driver’s failure to keep a proper lookout.  
      (3) The primary judge erred in focussing retrospectively on the cause of the particular collision rather than considering the matter prospectively, from the point of view of a reasonable person in Hanson’s position.  
      (4) Hanson’s duty of care permitted acknowledgment of the plaintiff’s knowledge and experience as a truck driver; and to require that Hanson provide a system of notification went beyond what was required to discharge a duty to exercise reasonable care.  
      (5) In circumstances where Hanson did not own, control or occupy the quarry, it was not in a position to establish a system of communication or notice to loader drivers.  
      (6) The primary judge did not specify what instruction should have been given to the plaintiff or what system of notification should have been established, or how this would have avoided the accident.  
      
    35 The view of the primary judge that Hanson owed a duty of care to the plaintiff similar to that of an employer to an employee, in accordance with Christie, was not challenged. In my opinion, the reasons of the primary judge show that he addressed the question of whether Hanson failed to exercise reasonable care, and did not treat the matter at issue as being whether Hanson failed to ensure the safety of the plaintiff. It is not uncommon to find expressions such as “duty to provide a safe place of work and a safe system of work” or “duty to ensure the employee’s safety”, when what is meant, fully expressed, was a duty to exercise reasonable care to those ends. In my opinion, so long as a judgment shows that the judge appreciated that the question was whether reasonable care was exercised and addressed that question, the use of such expressions does not of itself indicate error by the judge. The judgment in this case, read as a whole, shows that the primary judge appreciated and applied the correct test. 
     
      
    36 The circumstance that the loader driver’s failure to keep a proper lookout, was a contributing cause of the accident, does not exclude the lack of a system of notification as a further contributing cause.  
     
      
    37 In my opinion, it was open to the primary judge to take the view that the exercise of reasonable care by Hanson required it to be aware of the conditions at the place to which it was frequently sending the plaintiff, and to assess the safety of those conditions. To the extent that there was a system of notification of loader drivers in place, reasonable care would have disclosed that system to Hanson, and required Hanson to notify the plaintiff of that system; and the decision of the primary judge can be upheld on the alternative basis relied on by him, namely that the Report indicated there was a system which Hanson did not tell the plaintiff about. There is no error in the primary judge’s conclusion to that effect.  
     
      
    38 As regards the other basis for his decision, namely that reasonable care required Hanson to establish such a system, in my opinion a finding to that effect was also available to the primary judge. I note incidentally that the plaintiff’s allegation in the statement of claim that Hanson was formerly known as Pioneer Construction Materials Pty Limited (and thus perhaps was a company closely associated with Pioneer) was not denied by Hanson; and as mentioned earlier, photographs of signs at the approach to the quarry could support an inference that Pioneer was the occupier of the quarry. But quite apart from inferences that might be drawn from these matters, the evidence was that the plaintiff was going to the quarry on behalf of Hanson five to ten times a week over the two months he was working for Hanson; and in my opinion, it would not have been unreasonably burdensome for Hanson to liaise with the quarry occupier to establish a system such as that put into place after the accident to avoid the obvious risk of a collision between front-end loaders and trucks delivering material to the quarry. The plaintiff gave evidence, accepted by the primary judge, that the practice of quarries other than Wallgrove was often that a truck driver had to stop at the entrance and make radio contact with the quarry staff before proceeding. In my opinion, there is no error in the primary judge’s conclusion that Hanson’s failure to do this was a breach of its duty of care.  
     
      
       
      Contributory negligence  
      
    39 It was submitted for Hanson (and Pioneer) that the primary judge was in error not to find the plaintiff guilty of contributory negligence. It was put that, in circumstances where the plaintiff had not alerted the loader driver to his presence, parking where he did amounted to a lack of reasonable care for his own safety; and it was also put that he should have sounded his horn earlier to alert the loader driver.  
     
      
    40 In my opinion, there was no error by the primary judge in his assessment that the plaintiff was not shown to have failed to exercise reasonable care for his own safety. He was in a large vehicle, with its lights on. It was not explicitly put to the plaintiff that he should have parked elsewhere, let alone where he should have parked, or that he should have sounded his horn earlier.  
     
      
       
      Apportionment  
      
    41 It was submitted for Hanson that the actions of the driver involved greater negligence than any breach by Hanson of its duty of care, and also contributed more substantially and directly to the accident. Further, Pioneer was in a position where it could have established a system of notice and communication. In these circumstances, it was submitted, equal apportionment of liability was so unreasonable to justify appellate intervention.  
     
      
    42 However, as noted above, there was no claim against Pioneer other than on the basis of its vicarious liability for the negligence of the driver; so the liability of Pioneer for the purposes of apportionment is limited to its liability on the basis of the driver’s negligence.  
     
      
    43 As with apportionment for contributory negligence, an appeal court should not intervene on apportionment under s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1946 unless error appears in the reasons or the result is plainly unreasonable: cf Podrebersek v Australian Iron and Steel Pty Limited [1985] HCA 34; (1985) 59 ALJR 492 at 493-4.  
     
      
    44 To assess comparative degrees of fault as between a failure by a person in the position of an employer to fulfil the particular and important duty of care owed to a person in the position of an employee, on the one hand, and a casual act of negligence in breach of a general duty of care owed to people generally, on the other hand, is very much a matter of judgment as to which reasonable minds can differ; and the same applies to assessing comparative degrees of contribution to the happening of the accident. I am not able to say that the primary judge’s assessment was unreasonable to the extent of justifying appellate intervention.  
     
      
       
      Non-economic loss  
      
    45 It was submitted for Hanson (and Pioneer) that the finding of 35 per cent for non-economic loss was disproportionate to the injuries and residual disability experienced by the plaintiff, was excessive, and was beyond a sound discretionary judgment; and that it should be revised to 20 per cent. This was particularly so, it was submitted, when the evidence was that degenerative changes in the plaintiff’s back could have resulted in disability even without the accident.  
     
      
    46 It was pointed out that the primary judge placed reliance on a report of Dr Deveridge dated 16 December 2003, which contained an assumption that the plaintiff would be unable to work for more than 25 hours per week, when the fact was that the plaintiff at the time of the trial was working 48 hours per week (four 12 hour shifts).  
     
      
    47 In my opinion, the latter point does not detract significantly from the weight to be given to Dr Deveridge’s report. The evidence was that, although the plaintiff was on duty for four 12 hour shifts per week, each shift involved driving for short periods totalling on average about four hours per shift.  
     
      
    48 The primary judge accepted the plaintiff as both reliable and truthful. He accepted the plaintiff’s evidence concerning substantial pain and discomfort. In addition to the particular findings referred to above, the plaintiff gave evidence of inability to play sport as he had before the accident, and of difficulties in interacting with his children. At the date of the trial, he was only 40 years old.  
     
      
    49 In all the circumstances, although 35 per cent could be considered at the higher end of the range, it is not in my opinion so high as to justify appellate intervention. Indeed counsel for Hanson at the trial accepted that an award of 35 percent, although at the high end, was not outside the range available to the primary judge. 
     
      
       
      Past economic loss  
      
    50 It was established below that, during the 110 weeks between the accident and the commencement of his employment with Multiserv, the plaintiff had earned $22,235.90 from Adecco; and it was common ground that this should be deducted from the figure for past economic loss and that there be a consequential adjustment to superannuation. What was in issue was $8,500 in respect of lost opportunity to work overtime.  
     
      
    51 The primary judge found that the plaintiff “now earns significantly more than it is likely he would have earned if he had not been injured” (par [58]); and while this is not spelled out, it must be that the primary judge considered that, but for the accident, the plaintiff would probably have continued in employment with Adecco earning at similar levels as before the accident. That is, he would not have looked around for other employment, as he in fact did, and would not have obtained the more lucrative job with Multiserv. There is no challenge by the plaintiff to this finding of the primary judge.  
     
      
    52 In my opinion, this does have the consequence that the loss of opportunity to earn overtime with Multiserv cannot be considered as past economic loss caused by the accident: but for the accident, the plaintiff probably would not have been working for Multiserv and in fact would have been earning less than what he was earning at Multiserv. Accordingly, the figure of $8,500 should come off past economic loss.  
     
      
       
      Future economic loss  
      
    53 In considering future economic loss, regard should be had to s 13 of the Civil Liability Act 2002 to which his Honour’s attention was apparently not directed. Section 13 reads as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        13 Future economic loss—claimant’s prospects and adjustments 
         
         
        (1) A court cannot make an award of damages for future economic loss unless the claimant first satisfies the court that the assumptions about future earning capacity or other events on which the award is to be based accord with the claimant’s most likely future circumstances but for the injury.  
         
         
        (2) When a court determines the amount of any such award of damages for future economic loss it is required to adjust the amount of damages for future economic loss that would have been sustained on those assumptions by reference to the percentage possibility that the events might have occurred but for the injury.  
         
         
        (3) If the court makes an award for future economic loss, it is required to state the assumptions on which the award was based and the relevant percentage by which damages were adjusted. 
        
       
      
    54 In support of his cross-appeal, the plaintiff sought to rely on an affidavit by his solicitor showing that his employment with Multiserv had in fact ceased on 30 September 2009. The Court indicated that it would decide on the admissibility of that evidence in its judgment. The plaintiff also sought to rely on an affidavit by the plaintiff himself; but in circumstances where that affidavit was served very shortly before the hearing, and where the other parties wished to respond to it if it were admitted, the Court decided to reject that affidavit on the ground that it had not been served a reasonable time before the date fixed for the hearing of the appeal and cross-appeal.  
     
      
    55 For Hanson (and Pioneer) it was submitted that the primary judge erred in basing the award for future economic loss on a loss of capacity referable to his then current earnings of about $75,000 net per year, which were substantially in excess of pre-injury earnings and in excess of what it was likely that the plaintiff would have earned if he had not been injured. It was submitted that the plaintiff should have been awarded no more than a buffer in the order of $60,000.  
     
      
    56 For the plaintiff, it was submitted that the primary judge erred in finding that the plaintiff had not established on the balance of probabilities that he would shortly lose his job with Multiserv, and not be able to obtain alternative work. Further, the evidence now showed that the plaintiff’s employment with Multiserv had been terminated.  
     
      
    57 It was submitted for the plaintiff that future economic loss should be awarded on the basis of a loss of a total of $826.88 per week, for 25 years (multiplier 753.6) less 20 per cent for contingencies.  
     
      
    58 Dealing first with the question whether the affidavit should be admitted into evidence, general principles in relation to evidence of this kind have been stated by Lord Wilberforce in Mulholland v Mitchell [1971] AC 666 at 679-80, to the effect that it is a matter of “discretion and degree” and that:  
     
      
       
        
        Negatively, fresh evidence ought not to be admitted when it bears on matters falling within the field or area of uncertainty, in which the trial judge’s estimate has previously been made. Positively, it may be admitted if some basic assumptions, common to both sides, have clearly been falsified by subsequent events, particularly if this has happened by the act of the defendant. Positively, too, it may be expected that courts will allow fresh evidence when to refuse it would affront commonsense, or a sense of justice. … The exceptional character of cases in which fresh evidence is allowed is fully recognised …  
        
       
      
    59 This approach has been applied in New South Wales in Warr v Santos [1973] 1 NSWLR 432, Radnedge v Government Insurance Office of NSW (1987) 9 NSWLR 235 and Doherty v Liverpool Hospital (1991) 22 NSWLR 284.  
     
      
    60 In my opinion, the fresh evidence in this case does “bear on matters falling within the field or area of uncertainty, in which the trial judge’s estimate has previously been made”; and I would not admit it for the purpose of making good a ground for challenging the primary judge’s assessment of future economic loss. However, if grounds for intervening in that assessment are otherwise made out, so that this Court has either to assess that element of damages itself or order a new trial, then fresh evidence of this kind is much more readily admitted: Warr. For reasons I will give, I do think grounds for intervening in the primary judge’s assessment of future economic loss are otherwise made out, and I would admit the affidavit for the purpose of assisting this Court in assessing that element of damages.  
     
      
    61 I am not satisfied the primary judge erred in the respect submitted by the plaintiff. The plaintiff did give evidence that one of his roles was to drive a pneumatic tanker, into which solid material is pumped and then pumped out at another location (Black 90C-M), and it appears that it was on that basis that Mr McDonald of BHP expressed the view at trial that the plaintiff’s job concerned a contract that was not to terminate on 30 June 2009. The plaintiff did give evidence that he also drove trucks filled with scrap metal, but it was not put to Mr McDonald that this meant his job must concern the contract that was to terminate on 30 June 2009; so in my opinion the conclusion of the primary judge was one that he could reasonably reach.  
     
      
    62 However, in my opinion the primary judge did err in the way contended for by Hanson (and Pioneer). The plaintiff’s future economic loss had to be assessed by comparison with his “most likely future circumstances but for the injury” (Civil Liability Act s13), which was, on the primary judge’s findings, his continued employment with Adecco at the October 2008 equivalent of $700 net per week in June 2002. The Court was not provided with evidence of what that equivalent was, but applying the available CPI figures, it would appear to be about $850 per week net.  
     
      
    63 On one view, it might be said that the primary judge assessed the plaintiff’s residual capacity at just over $1,000 net per week, suggesting that there should be no future economic loss. In my opinion, the better view is that the primary judge assessed his residual capacity on the basis of a loss of about 28 per cent, which gives a figure of about $400 when applied to $1,440 per week (derived from $75,000 per year). Applying the same percentage to $850 per week would give a loss of about $250 per week.  
     
      
    64 It was submitted for the plaintiff that he has now lost his job with Multiserv and is virtually unemployable. However, the plain fact is that, to his credit, the plaintiff was able to obtain the job at Multiserv and retain that job for five years, after which he was made redundant because of the economic downturn. There was no suggestion that he was unable to perform the job or did not perform it satisfactorily.  
     
      
    65 In my opinion, an assessment of the plaintiff’s residual capacity at about $600 per week, that is, substantially less than half of what he was earning with Multiserv, is a reasonable assessment; and on that basis I would award future economic loss on the basis of $250 per week, applying the multiplier of 753.6 and deducting 20 per cent for vicissitudes, giving $150,720.  
     
      
       
      Domestic assistance  
      
    66 Hanson (and Pioneer) referred to s 15 of the Civil Liability Act, and submitted its requirements were not satisfied.  
     
      
    67 However, in my opinion it is clear that damages under this head were awarded, not on the basis of gratuitous assistance, but on the basis of amounts which the plaintiff could reasonably be expected to actually pay for house maintenance and lawn-mowing. In my opinion, there was evidence that could support the finding of $60 per month.  
     
      
    68 It would have been possible to apply a multiplier of 953.3 to $16 per week, giving little over $15,000. It is not clear if that is what the primary judge did. In any event, in my opinion no error is shown in his figure of $15,000.  
     
      
       
      Conclusion  
      
    69 On the basis of the above reasons, the damages for which Hanson is liable (subject to s 151Z adjustment) should be calculated as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        Non-economic loss $154,500.00 
         
        Past expenses 29,569.41 
         
        Future expenses 15,000.00 
         
        Past economic loss 54,765.10 
         
        Superannuation 6,024.16 
         
        Future economic loss 150,720.00 
         
        Superannuation 16,579.20 
         
        Assistance  
         15,000.00 
         
        Total $442,157.87 
        
       
      
    70 Pioneer is liable for $154,500 less than this, namely $287,657.87.  
     
      
    71 These figures still need to be adjusted in conformity with s 151Z of the Workers Compensation Act.  
     
      
    72 As regards the costs of the appeal and the cross-appeal, on the question of liability, Hanson has failed and Pioneer and the plaintiff have succeeded. On the question of damages, Hanson and Pioneer have had some success, and the plaintiff has failed on his cross-appeal.  
     
      
    73 It would be extremely difficult to separate out the costs of the appeal and the cross-appeal. My tentative view is that Hanson should be ordered to pay Pioneer’s costs of the appeal and cross-appeal, and that the plaintiff should be ordered to pay one-half of Hanson’s costs of the appeal and cross-appeal, and to have a Suitors’ Fund certificate to the extent that those costs are applicable to the appeal.  
     
      
    74 No change need be made to the costs orders below.  
     
      
    75 As regards the form of the orders, in my opinion there should not be judgments for money sums on the cross-claim, because the cross-claimants are not entitled to judgments unless and until they have actually paid the plaintiff. The method that has been adopted in the past has been to give verdicts but not judgments on the cross-claims: Roads and Traffic Authority (NSW) v Turner [2008] NSWCA 48 at [38], Andrews v Nominal Defendant (1962) 63 SR(NSW) 110 at 119-120. It is true, as pointed out by Basten JA, that the term “verdict” is most commonly applied to a jury verdict; but the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules do not limit the use of that term to jury verdicts. See in particular the definition of “verdict” in UCPR 51.2, and also UCPR 51.18(1)(f). An alternative would be to make an appropriate declaration, but I think it is reasonable to continue to follow the procedure used in Andrews and Turner.  
     
      
    76 There is one other matter concerning the content of orders that was not raised below or on appeal but that I should mention, lest this case stand as a precedent. The effect of giving Hanson a verdict against Pioneer for 50 per cent of Hanson’s liability to the plaintiff is that Pioneer will pay as much as Hanson towards the plaintiff’s verdict, even though Pioneer is not liable for non-economic loss and Hanson is liable for non-economic loss. There could be a real question whether this is just and equitable, in terms of s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act.  
     
      
    77 In Ace-Semi Trailer Sales Pty Limited v Zurich Australia Insurance Limited [2009] NSWCA 381, it was held (following Estate of Mutton v Howard Haulage Pty Limited [2007] NSWCA 340) that, where an employer would not have been liable for costs if sued by an employee, it was not just and equitable under s 5 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act that the employer should contribute to the costs of the employee payable by a third party tortfeasor. The same argument may apply in a case where one tortfeasor is liable for damages for non-economic loss and the other one is not; that is, it might have been arguable that Pioneer (not being liable for non-economic loss) should not have to contribute to Hanson’s liability for non-economic loss.  
     
      
    78 However, to raise that point would have required an appeal on this point to be brought by Pioneer, which did not happen.  
     
      
    79 I propose the following orders:  
     
      
      (1) Appeal allowed.  
      (2) Cross-appeal dismissed.  
      (3) Hanson to bring in short minutes of order within twenty-eight days, or if short minutes of order are not agreed, to bring in its proposed short minutes with submissions, with submissions from the other parties to be provided within a further fourteen days.  
      
    80 BASTEN JA: I agree with the orders proposed by Hodgson JA at [79] and, with one minor qualification, with his Honour’s reasons. 
     
      
    81 The qualification concerns a purely technical matter. At [75] his Honour has suggested that the orders on the cross-claims, which cannot at this stage constitute judgments for specified sums of money, should be described as “verdicts”. I do not understand the distinction sought to be drawn in relation to the orders made in a trial by a judge alone or, on a rehearing, by this Court. The distinction operates where there is a jury, as was the case in Andrews v Nominal Defendant (1962) 63 SR (NSW) 110. The approach adopted there appears to have been carried over into Roads and Traffic Authority of NSW v Turner [2008] NSWCA 48. (No doubt there are other illustrations of the same practice.) However, the practice does not reflect the language of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), Pt 36. Nor does the purported distinction carry any self-evident consequence, in circumstances where the “judgment or order” will take effect either on the date on which it is given or made, or when it is entered, which, under the “computerised court record system” is usually the same date: UCPR rr 36.4 and 36.11. 
     
      
    82 This qualification has no bearing on the outcome of the case, nor on the orders presently proposed. 
     
      
    83 SACKVILLE AJA: I agree with Hodgson JA.

     R v Scott McCONALOGUE 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 TOBIAS JA: I agree with Hidden J. 
     
      
    2 HIDDEN J: The respondent, Scott McConalogue, awaits trial in the District Court on a charge of knowingly taking part in the manufacture or production of a large commercial quantity of amphetamine. At a pre-trial hearing, after receiving evidence on the voir dire, a judge of that Court made a number of evidentiary rulings. By two of those rulings his Honour rejected evidence which was to be led in the prosecution case. The Crown has appealed against those rulings, pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912.  
     
      
    3 The offence is alleged to have been committed between late March and early April 2006 at a remote property in north-eastern New South Wales. The property was owned by Kane Holland. There is abundant evidence that Holland and three other men were involved in manufacturing amphetamine there. Indeed, the four of them pleaded guilty to an offence under Commonwealth legislation of conspiring to manufacture the drug. The respondent is charged with a State offence: s 24(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985. The matter had been the subject of a joint Federal and State police investigation.  
     
      
    4 It is the Crown case that the respondent was a party to a joint enterprise to manufacture amphetamine, his role being to be present at the property and to secure it during the production process. The case against him is entirely circumstantial. The circumstances relied on, including the matters the subject of the appeal, are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (a) Federal police executed a search warrant at the property in the late afternoon of 6 April 2006. In a large shed they found a metal drying tray containing several kilograms of amphetamine, together with a quantity of drug paraphernalia. Beneath the shed was a concrete bunker which was, in effect, a laboratory for the manufacture of amphetamine. Production of the drug was in progress in a modified beer keg contained in an electric cement mixer. In a smaller shed police found quantities of drug related chemicals, and empty containers which had held chemicals of that kind were lying in the open in the vicinity of the sheds. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) On three occasions between 29 and 31 March 2006, police who had the property under surveillance observed the respondent drive into or out of it. On two of those occasions he stopped at the mail box, which was located at the entrance to the driveway, and on one occasion he removed mail from it.  
        
       
       
        
        (c) There was a house on the property. During the search police found in the house various items connected to the respondent, including a series of documents in his name, some of them addressed to him at the property. Among those was a receipt, bearing a date in July 2005, for rent paid by him to Holland in respect of the house. Also found in the smaller shed was a photo album which contained, among other things, photos of the respondent in the house.  
        
       
       
        
        (d) The respondent was the only person present at the property at the time police arrived to conduct the search. 
         
         
        (e) At about 4.00pm on 6 April 2006, before the search, two Federal agents who were in the area encountered the respondent walking from the vicinity of the property. The agents were disguised as army officers and pretended to be involved in an exercise in the area. The respondent had a conversation with one of them, Federal agent (FA) Swanson, in which he said that he was renting the property and lived there alone. 
        
       
       
        
        (f) On a coffee table in the living room police found a handwritten note addressed to “Kaneo”. The note read: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          “I am going to ask you for a lift in a minute, to Mel’s place, say ‘YES’. Will need to talk right  
          NOW 
           – But not in the car, down the  
          road 
          .”  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        “Mel”, apparently, was a female friend of the respondent. It is the Crown case that “Kaneo” was Kane Holland, that the respondent suspected that the two men who appeared to be army officers were police investigating activities at the property, that he was expecting Holland to arrive at the property that evening, and that he feared that the house and Holland’s vehicle might be bugged. Accordingly, he wrote the note with a view to drawing it to Holland’s attention and speaking to him down the road and out of the house, so as to alert him to the possibility that police had detected the amphetamine production. In fact, at about 6.30pm Holland drove his vehicle into the access road leading to the property, but drove away when he saw police officers and vehicles in the vicinity. He was pursued by police and arrested. 
        
       
       
        
        (g) On the floor of the main bedroom police found a semi-automatic pistol, together with a loaded magazine and a box of ammunition. There were also found in that bedroom documents bearing false names used by Holland and a plastic container of amphetamine bearing his fingerprint, from which it appears that Holland occupied that bedroom, at least from time to time.  
        
       
       
        
        (h) At the time of the search of the property, the respondent was confronted by several police officers, made to lie on the ground, was handcuffed and was searched by FA Green. Green asked him whether there was anyone else in the house, and he said that there was not. Green asked whether there were any weapons in the house, to which he replied, “Yes, there’s a pistol in the bedroom.” 
        
       
       
        
        (i) There were three bedrooms in the house. Apart from the main bedroom, there was a second bedroom which may have been used by the respondent. A third bedroom had been converted into a sophisticated hydroponics set up, apparently for growing marijuana. Two hydroponic light bulbs in the room contained Kane Holland’s fingerprints. In the large shed was found a pot containing over one kilogram of marijuana.  
        
       
      
    5 It is the evidence of the last two matters, that is, the respondent’s admission that he knew there was a gun in the house and the hydroponic set up in the third bedroom, which his Honour rejected. To enliven this Court’s jurisdiction to entertain an appeal by the Crown against those rulings, they must be such as to eliminate or substantially weaken the prosecution case: s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act. I am satisfied that they would substantially weaken the Crown case, and I shall return to that matter after considering the merits of the appeal.  
     
      
    6 The respondent had objected to the admission of the “Kaneo” note, but his Honour allowed it. However, the Crown had submitted that one of the inferences that might be drawn on the basis of the note, together with the evidence of Holland approaching the property in his vehicle on the evening in question, was that he intended to spend the night at the property and complete the amphetamine “cook”. His Honour expressed the view that that inference was too remote.  
     
      
    7 This was also the subject of a ground of the appeal. The Crown prosecutor before us explained that the ground had been put on for more abundant caution. However, it does not appear to me that his Honour’s observation could be the subject of an appeal under s 5F, which is concerned with interlocutory judgments or orders, and at the hearing the Crown prosecutor did not press this ground. Whether it was appropriate for his Honour to make such an observation in the course of a pre-trial evidentiary ruling, and what status it might have in the course of the trial, are not matters which need be considered. 
     
      
    8 It is important to understand the purpose for which the Crown relies upon evidence of the respondent’s knowledge of the presence of the gun in the house, and the hydroponic set up in the bedroom. There is evidence that the respondent occupied the house as Holland’s tenant. The inference is available that he knew that a large-scale drug making enterprise was being conducted on the property. However, that knowledge would not be sufficient to establish his complicity in the enterprise. As I have said, the Crown case is that his role was to be present at the property and to secure it during the production of the amphetamine. 
     
      
    9 It is necessary, then, for the Crown to prove that the respondent was not simply a person legitimately occupying the house by virtue of a tenancy, who may have turned a blind eye to criminal activity being conducted on the property. The Crown does not suggest that the gun found in the main bedroom belonged to the respondent or was in his possession. Nor does the Crown suggest that the respondent was involved in any way in the hydroponic cultivation of marijuana. Indeed, there is no evidence that the hydroponic set up was being used at the time of the search. However, the Crown says that he must have been aware of the hydroponic set up and the evidence of FA Green conveys that he was aware of the presence of the pistol in the house. This evidence, it is said, tends to establish that the association between Holland and the respondent at the relevant time was not the normal relationship of landlord and tenant. 
     
      
       
      The pistol 
       
      
    10 In rejecting the evidence of the respondent’s conversation with FA Green concerning the pistol, his Honour found that he was in police custody and “a suspect in a possible illegal activity”. He saw the question relating to the gun as “a question to a suspect and in itself possibly involved a criminal offence.” He noted that FA Green had not cautioned the respondent, which he found to be a breach of s 23F of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). Accordingly, his Honour held that the evidence had been obtained in contravention of an Australian law, for the purpose of s 138(1) of the Evidence Act 1995. In assessing the gravity of that contravention, as required by s 138(3)(d), he referred to the right of a person under police investigation for a crime to remain silent, a right which he described as “fundamental”. He then concluded that it would be unfair to the respondent to admit the evidence, applying s 90 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    11 By s 23F(1), an investigating official must caution a person before questioning him or her, if the person “is under arrest or a protected suspect …”. The expression “protected suspect” is defined in s 23B(2) of the Crimes Act. It is not necessary to examine that definition because it was not put on the respondent’s behalf that he was a protected suspect. What was argued by Ms Wells SC, who appeared in the District Court and this Court, was that he was effectively under arrest. 
     
      
    12 His Honour made no express finding about that proposition, although what he said implies that he saw s 23F as applicable on that basis. Nor did his Honour refer to the voir dire evidence of FA Green about the matter, apart from the officer’s evidence that the respondent “was in his custody after he had been confronted by the 4 Agents, made to lay face-down on the ground and handcuffed.” However, for the purposes of s 23F, a person is arrested if he or she “is arrested for a Commonwealth offence …”: s 23B(1). On any view of the evidence, that had not occurred. 
     
      
    13 Certainly, the respondent was in police custody, having been restrained in the manner described in the evidence. However, the search warrant expressly authorised officers executing it to use “such force against persons … as is necessary and reasonable in the circumstances …”, a power authorised by s 3G(b) of the Crimes Act. His Honour saw the process of making the respondent lie on the ground, handcuffing him and searching him as “normal police procedure … in this type of situation …”.  
     
      
    14 FA Green’s evidence was that he asked the respondent whether there were any other persons or weapons in the house “for the safety of my team and the safety of any other persons that may have been on the property.” It was the responsibility of him and the officers with him to “conduct a clearance of the property”, so that other police later could “safely search the property for evidence.” In response to an assertion in cross-examination that there was no basis for the respondent to be restrained as he was, he said that they had information that there may be weapons on the property, that at that stage they did not know who the respondent was or whether he may have had a weapon on him, or how many other people there might have been at the property.  
     
      
    15 In the light of this evidence, there appears to be no basis upon which a breach of s 23F of the Crimes Act could have been found, and it was that finding only which led to his Honour’s conclusion that there had been a contravention of the law engaging s 138 of the Evidence Act. However, his Honour does not appear to have rejected the evidence through the application of that section, as he did not consider the probative value of the evidence and undertake the balancing exercise, with an eye to policy considerations, which the section requires. It seems that his conclusion that the evidence should be rejected was founded upon a finding of unfairness for the purpose of s 90, but that itself was based only upon the finding of a breach of s 23F. 
     
      
    16 Accordingly, I am satisfied that his Honour fell into error in his reasoning towards rejection of the evidence. In oral argument, Ms Wells realistically acknowledged as much. Her primary submission was that his Honour’s ruling did not substantially weaken the Crown case, a proposition to which I shall return.  
     
      
    17 I should record that Ms Wells had also submitted that his Honour should reject the evidence under s 137 of the Evidence Act, on the basis that its probative value is outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice to the respondent. His Honour did not deal with that argument, but it is apparent that it could not have succeeded. There would be no prejudice to the respondent, given that the Crown case is no more than that he was aware of the presence of the weapon and it is not suggested that he had any involvement with it. On the other hand, the evidence has considerable probative value on the question of the relationship between Holland and the respondent. As Howie J put it during an exchange with Ms Wells in oral argument, it is improbable that in a normal domestic tenancy the landlord would leave a pistol and ammunition in the house, given that the tenant would be entitled to the free run of the premises.  
     
      
       
      The hydroponic set up 
       
      
    18 In rejecting evidence of the hydroponic set up in the third bedroom, his Honour recognised that the Crown did not rely upon it as tendency evidence, but only as evidence tending to establish the true nature of the relationship between the respondent and Holland and to rebut any suggestion that that relationship was solely one of landlord and tenant. His Honour recognised that the inference could be drawn that the respondent knew of the hydroponic set up in the third bedroom. However, his Honour continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my view, the next step, the Crown wishes to take, that is the accused knew what was going on in the room, he too must have been involved in the cultivation of the cannabis or that he was in the drug business with Kane Holland, is too big a leap, on the basis of the evidence, for the Crown to take such a step.”  
        
       
      
    19 His Honour added that to admit the evidence would raise “a real possibility” that the jury might misuse it notwithstanding any directions he gave about it. He found that there was “not a sufficient connection” between the offence charged and “the evidence sought to be adduced about the hydroponic equipment in one room of the house.” He concluded that the probative value of the evidence was outweighed by the unfair prejudice it would cause the respondent, applying s 137 of the Evidence Act.  
     
      
    20 With respect, the passage of his Honour’s reasons which I have quoted misconceives the basis upon which the Crown tendered the evidence. The Crown did not seek to establish that the respondent “must have been involved in the cultivation of the cannabis” or that he was, in some general way, “in the drug business” with Holland. While his Honour did state the purpose for which the Crown tendered the evidence, that is, as evidence going to the true relationship between the respondent and Holland at the relevant time, he did not address it in his reasons. 
     
      
    21 It is true, as Ms Wells pointed out in submissions, that the hydroponic equipment related to a different drug from that the subject of the offence charged, and that there was no evidence that it was in use and, in particular, that it had been used while the respondent was at the property. Given the limited purpose for which the Crown relies upon the evidence, however, none of this is to the point.  
     
      
    22 Nor did his Honour explain why he thought it possible that the jury might misuse the evidence notwithstanding his directions about it. The jury would need to be directed that the evidence was led for a limited purpose only and that they should avoid impermissible propensity reasoning. In child sexual assault cases, almost routinely, trial judges have to give a direction of that kind where the evidence of a pattern of abuse has been admitted to put the offences charged in their context: see generally Qualtieri v R [2006] NSWCCA 95, 171 A Crim R 463. This case presents no greater difficulty. 
     
      
    23 In these circumstances, it is difficult to see how the respondent would suffer any unfair prejudice through admission of the evidence, let alone prejudice such as to outweigh its probative value. The evidence has a probative force similar to that of the evidence concerning the respondent’s knowledge of the pistol in the house. To adapt the observation of Howie J to which I earlier referred, it is improbable that there would be a normal domestic tenancy, entitling the tenant to the free run of premises, over a house containing a room with equipment for the clandestine production of a prohibited drug. 
     
      
    24 In rejecting this evidence also, I am satisfied that his Honour fell into error. 
     
      
       
      Jurisdiction 
       
      
    25 It remains, then, to deal with the question whether the threshold for this Court’s jurisdiction set by s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act has been crossed: in this case, whether the rejection of the evidence substantially weakens the Crown case. For this purpose, it is necessary not just to examine each of the items of evidence concerned but also to have regard to their combined effect. That involves an assessment of the case at hand, assisted by the Chief Justice’s examination of the approach to the issue in R v Shamouil [2006] NSWCCA 112, 66 NSWLR 228, at [27] – [40]. 
     
      
    26 As I have said, the Crown case against the respondent is entirely circumstantial. Moreover, that circumstantial case is within a small compass. Putting aside the evidence the subject of this appeal, it comprises evidence to this effect:  
     
      
       
        the respondent was in occupation of the house and had access to its surrounds; 
       
       
        he lived there alone or, at least, was the only regular occupant (evidence of FA Swanson, evidence of occasional occupation of the main bedroom by Holland); 
       
       
        in the afternoon of 6 April 2006, when an amphetamine “cook” was in progress, he was the only person present at the property; 
       
       
        the “Kaneo” note and the evidence of Holland’s approach to the property in the evening suggest that the respondent was aware of the “cook”, was expecting Holland to arrive, and was concerned that the production of the drug would be detected by police. 
       
      
    27 Given that the Crown must prove not only that the respondent knew about the manufacture of amphetamine but also participated in it in the manner alleged, a circumstantial case based on those particulars might be seen as fairly weak. It would become significantly stronger if one were to add evidence that the association between Holland and the respondent at the relevant time was anything but the normal relationship of landlord and tenant. In my view, evidence to that effect would be an important plank in the Crown’s circumstantial case and would strengthen it to a substantial degree. That is the effect of the two items of evidence which his Honour rejected, and it follows that the rejection of that evidence would substantially weaken the Crown case.  
     
      
    28 Accordingly, I am satisfied that the Court has jurisdiction to intervene. I would allow the appeal and set aside his Honour’s rulings that evidence of the respondent’s knowledge of the presence of a pistol in the house, and of the hydroponic set up in the third bedroom, be rejected.

   DECISION: 
   I will make an order under s 20BJ (4) of the Crimes Act.Brett Adam MacPherson is to be released forthwith from custody into the supervision of his mother. He is to obey all her directions in relation to travel and medication. He is to attend immediately upon the Commonwealth Department of Immigration and the Consul-General of Canada and do all things necessary to obtain as rapidly as possible a visa to enable him to leave Australia and a passport or interim travel document to enable him to return to and enter Canada. As soon as possible after obtaining an Australian visa and a Canadian passport or interim travel document he is to travel on the first available transport to Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada, that travel to be under the continuous supervision in the escort of his mother. Upon arrival at Kelowna he is to attend upon Fred Kirsche, Central Okanagan Mental Health, Interior Health Authority, 1340 Ellis Street, Kelowna, British Columbia, V1Y9N1, Canada, for psychiatric assistance. He is to submit himself to such mental health care whether involving involuntary attention or otherwise as the Director, Randy Murray or his delegate may determine, and in accordance with the attached care plan. It is noted Mr MacPherson may receive a bridging visa E class or other travel documents provided by the Australian authorities but any such visa or document is to be used solely for the purpose of travelling from Australia to Canada. Parties are at liberty to apply to the court for any variation of this order on twenty four hours notice.

   1. HIS HONOUR: The offender, whom for convenience, I will refer to as Brett Adam MacPherson, appeared before me charged with an offence of importing into Australia 3478.2 grams of methamphetamine. He came by plane from Canada. The material that was drugs was in his suitcase. Sniffer dogs at the airport sniffed the drugs. He told the customs officers at the time on 15 December 2008 that he did not use drugs and he did not like dogs sniffing him. He was subsequently interviewed and told the interviewing police that he had come to Australia for the purpose of being a disc jockey. He was in fact, he said, a world famous disc jockey.2. He is a man who on all sides, it is agreed, was mentally ill at the time that he came into Australia. Therefore, I found him not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. 3. It is a very sad case where a person who is mentally ill has been taken advantage of by those involved in the drug trade in Canada to bring drugs into Australia. Very little provision was made for him when he arrived, nothing was provided for his accommodation, he was in effect just cast loose with a direction to ring someone at a particular hotel. He is the first person to come before me as a drug courier who is mentally ill. 4. The people in the drug trade have used all sorts of people. In my experience the youngest was I think a sixteen year old girl, the oldest was a seventy one year old man. 5. They have come from a variety of countries and in a variety of circumstances. This is the first time somebody who is mentally ill has been used as such a courier. He clearly had very little understanding of what he was doing here, he did know that he was carrying something it was illegal but he somehow had this delusional belief that this would assist him in pursuing his interest as a world famous disc jockey. Medical evidence establishes that he suffers from a variety of mental disorders the most serious of which is bipolar disorder. His mother has given evidence before me and it is clear that from shortly after his birth it was noticed that he had various mental disorders, they became more and more pronounced as he went on in life. Apart from bipolar disorder he suffers from autism and a variety of other personality problems. 6. He has been found not guilty on the ground of mental illness. Consequently, to have regard to the seriousness of the offence is not as relevant in this case as it might be in others. A person who is not guilty on the grounds of mental illness is not guilty. Special provisions apply under the Commonwealth Crimes Act for persons who are found not guilty on the grounds of mental illness. 7. Section 20BJ(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) provides that where a person has been charged with a federal offence on indictment and is acquitted because of mental illness the court must order that he be detained in safe custody in prison or in a hospital for a period specified in an order not exceeding the maximum period of imprisonment that could have been imposed if the person had been convicted of the offence charged. To some extent this parallels provisions under State law although the provisions under State law are now somewhat different because there is under State law a Mental Health Review Tribunal which is charged with the task of managing such people. 8. Under Commonwealth law the Attorney-General may vary prison or hospital and may make orders under s 20BK and 20BL reviewing his custody and indeed releasing him from custody. Notwithstanding provisions of s 20BJ(1), s 20BJ (4) provides that despite subs (1) the court may if in the court’s opinion that it is more appropriate to do so, then to make an order under subs (1) order the person’s release from custody either absolutely or subject to conditions to apply for such period as the court specifies and an order not exceeding three years. 9. The conditions may include a condition that he remain in the care of a responsible person nominated in the order, a condition that the person attend upon a person nominated or at a place specified in the order for assessment of the person’s mental illness, mental condition or intellectual disability, and where appropriate for treatment. Subs (6) provides that where a person has been released from custody subject to conditions the person or the Director of Public Prosecutions may at any time apply to the court to vary those conditions. 10. Mr MacPherson came to Australia originally on a Canadian passport presumably as a tourist. That passport has now expired and he is held in Australia pursuant to a Criminal Justice visa. Because his passport has expired he cannot return instantly to Canada when I release him unless he obtains some travel document of some kind enabling him to go there. What is proposed on his behalf is that he should be released and go with his mother forthwith to the Australian Department of Immigration, apply to them for a bridging visa E and with that the Canadian Consul-General would be prepared to make available to him a document enabling him to go to Canada. I am satisfied that if he goes to Canada he would be met at the airport by a person associated with a psychiatric facility, he would be assessed, placed in the control of a nominated psychiatrist and given appropriate treatment. In my opinion that is what should be done in this case. I have carefully considered the Commonwealth’s submission. That very carefully prepared submission argues fully and with some force for me to exercise my discretion and make an order under s 20B(j)(1), that would mean that he would be held in Australia subject to the direction of the Commonwealth Attorney-General.11. The submission points to the seriousness of the offence as one of the important factors in making this order. I agree that bringing into Australia large quantities of prohibited drugs is a serious offence. However as I have said if the person who brings them in is mentally ill and therefore not guilty the significance of that is not as great as it would otherwise be. Certainly the order which I make would be not something which could ever be argued would in some way encourage others to be involved in the same sorts of activities. The principles of general deterrence and specific deterrence really have no consequence in a case such as this because he is mentally ill. 12. In my opinion it is far more important for him to be back in Canada and getting appropriate treatment than it is for him to remain in Australia in a prison perhaps getting some treatment and perhaps not. I can see no value to the people of Australia for him to remain in Australia. Of course in normal circumstances if a person commits a crime, particularly a very serious one, it is important that that be registered by the imposition of an appropriate sentence so that any others who might be minded to engage in such activities are deterred from doing so. And the person himself is appropriately punished for what he has done. I have already indicated I do not see there is any basis for such considerations in the present case.13. I have decided therefore that I will make an order under s 20BJ (4) of the Crimes Act, a draft order has been provided to the counsel for the Commonwealth. It has been made available to me. The order is in terms which I agree with and I make the order.14. The order that I make is as follows that the offender or the person, Brett Adam MacPherson is to be released forthwith from custody into the supervision of his mother, Linda Duck. He is to obey all directions from Linda Duck in relation to travel and medication. He is to attend immediately upon the Commonwealth Department of Immigration and the Consul-General of Canada and do all things necessary to obtain as rapidly as possible a visa to enable him to leave Australia and a passport or interim travel document to enable him to return to and enter Canada. As soon as possible after obtaining an Australian visa and a Canadian passport or interim travel document he is to travel on the first available transport to Kelowna, British Columbia, Canada, that travel to be under the continuous supervision in the escort of Linda Duck. Upon arrival at Kelowna he is to attend upon Fred Kirsche, Central Okanagan Mental Health, Interior Health Authority, 1340 Ellis Street, Kelowna, British Columbia, V1Y9N1, Canada, for psychiatric assistance. He is to submit himself to such mental health care whether involving involuntary attention or otherwise as the Director, Randy Murray or his delegate may determine, and in accordance with the attached care plan, two page document headed Interior Health dated 29/1/10 from Randy Murray addressed to Mrs Linda Duck supplemented by a two page email dated 1/4/10 from Randy Murray to Greg James. It is noted Mr MacPherson may receive a bridging visa E class or other travel documents provided by the Australian authorities but any such visa or document is to be used solely for the purpose of travelling from Australia to Canada. Parties are at liberty to apply to the court for any variation of this order on twenty four hours notice.

   ORDERS: 
   There has been a sentencing error, in that the maximum penalty for the offence was nine months imprisonment. 
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
  
   
    
   Reasons for Decision1    Mark Jamieson has a significant criminal record, and comes before the court apparently in breach of a suspended sentence bond pursuant to s12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 due to the commission of fresh offences. He has pleaded guilty to these fresh offences. His solicitor Mr Behan has submitted that the sentence pursuant to s12 is in error, and ought to be corrected by this court prior to the defendant being sentenced for the fresh offences. Mr Behan makes preliminary submissions that the corrected sentence ought to be a bond pursuant to s9 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. If the corrected sentence is anything higher on the scale of penalties than that, Mr Behan has instructions to appeal that corrected sentence, and thus seeks to have the fresh matters adjourned pending that appeal. He also queries the starting date of any corrected sentence if it is a custodial sentence, suspended or otherwise.  
    2    The issues to be determined are 
    A. Has there been a sentencing error, and if so 
     
      
       
        
       B. Who should correct that error, and if this court 
        
        
       C. What is the effect of any correction 
        
        
       D. What are the appeal rights of the defendant following any correction 
       
      
    3    It is clear that the issue of the alleged sentencing error and any correction must be resolved prior to sentencing for the fresh offences - R v Cooke; Cooke v R [2007] NSWCCA 184. 
    4    Mr Jamieson’s has a lengthy prior criminal record (excluding Children’s Court matters) dating back to 1976. Relevant to the current issues are the following matters 
     
      
       
       1976 PCA Disqualified 12 months plus fine 
        
       1978 PCA Disqualified 18 months plus fine 
       1980 Drive Man Dangerous Disqualified 3 years plus fine 
        Drive Disqualified Disqualified 6 months plus fine 
        
         
        
       1987 Refuse Breath Analysis Disqualified 2 years plus fine 
        
        Unlicensed Fine  
       1990 Drive Manner Dangerous Disqualified 3 years plus s558 bond 
       1996 Unlicensed Disqualified 2 years plus fine 
        High Range PCA Disqualified 4 years plus CSO 
       2000 High Range PCA Disqualified 2 years plus CSO 
        Drive Disqualified Disqualified 2 years plus s9 Bond 
       22/9/2008 Unlicensed Disqualified 2 years plus fine 
        Unlicensed Disqualified 2 years plus fine 
       Mid Range PCA Disqualified 2 years plus suspended sentence (s12) for 12 months 
       
       
      
     29/4/09 Drive Disqualified Plea guilty – to be sentenced Low Range PCA Plea guilty – to be sentenced5    In relation to the last matters above, Mr Jamieson appeared at Waverley Court and pleaded guilty. The matters were adjourned to the Downing Centre Local Court for sentence, and a set of papers for breaching the s12 bond was prepared.  
     
      
     A. Has there been a sentencing error ? 
      
      
    6    It is contended by Mr Behan that the suspended sentence of 12 months imposed on 22 September 2008 is in error, and in my view this conclusion is correct.  
    7    The offence of Mid-Range PCA is provided by s9 of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 which relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
       (3) Offence-middle range prescribed concentration of alcohol  
       
      
      
       
       A person must not, while there is present in his or her breath or blood the middle range prescribed concentration of alcohol:  
        
        
        
        
         
         (a) drive a motor vehicle, or  
         (b) occupy the driving seat of a motor vehicle and attempt to put the motor vehicle in motion, or  
         (c) if the person is the holder of a driver licence (other than a provisional licence or a learner licence)-occupy the seat in a motor vehicle next to a holder of a learner licence who is driving the vehicle.  
         Maximum penalty: 20 penalty units or imprisonment for 9 months or both (in the case of a first offence) or 30 penalty units or imprisonment for 12 months or both (in the case of a second or subsequent offence).  
         
        
       
      
    8    A “second or subsequent offence” is defined in clause 2 of the “Dictionary” of the Road Transport (Safety and Traffic Management) Act 1999 as follows:  
     
      
       
        
         
           
         (1) An offence against a provision of this Act is a ""second or subsequent offence"" only if, within the period of 5 years immediately before a person is convicted of the offence, the person was convicted of another offence against the same provision or of a major offence.  
         (2) An offence against a provision of this Act is a ""first offence"" if it is not a second or subsequent offence.  
         
        
       
      
    9    The term “major offence” is in turn defined in the “Dictionary” as follows 
     
      
       
        
         
         ""major offence"" has the same meaning as it has in the  
         Road Transport (General) Act 
           
         2005 
          .  
         
         
        
       
      
    10    Section 188(1)(c) of the Road Transport (General) Act 2005 describes “major offences” and it is clear that Driving Unlicensed is not one of them.  
    11    Thus, in Mr Jamieson’s case, the maximum term of imprisonment for the offence of mid-range PCA is nine months.  
    12    There was some discussion during submissions that the five-year delineation only applied to the disqualification period, and thus any prior major offence meant that the longer imprisonment period was available. However, a careful reading of the above legislation shows this not to be correct. Naturally, had the offence of unlicensed driver been a “major offence” then the maximum penalty would have been 12 months. That may have been the source of the error of the sentencing magistrate on the previous occasion. 13    Accordingly, I find that there has been a sentencing error, in that the maximum penalty for the offence was nine months imprisonment.  
     
      
     B. Who should correct the error? 
      
      
    14    Section 43 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 is as follows:  
     
      
       
       43 Court may reopen proceedings to correct sentencing errors  
        
        
        
       (1) This section applies to criminal proceedings (including proceedings on appeal) in which a court has:  
        
         
         (a) imposed a penalty that is contrary to law, or  
         (b) failed to impose a penalty that is required to be imposed by law,  
         
        
       and so applies whether or not a person has been convicted of an offence in those proceedings.  
       (2) The court may reopen the proceedings (either on its own initiative or on the application of a party to the proceedings) and, after giving the parties an opportunity to be heard:  
        
         
         (a) may impose a penalty that is in accordance with the law, and  
         (b) if necessary, may amend any relevant conviction or order.  
         
        
       (3) For the purposes of this section, the court:  
        
         
         (a) may call on the person to whom the proceedings relate to appear before it and, if the person does not appear, may issue a warrant for the person’s arrest, or  
         (b) if of the opinion that the person will not appear if called on to do so, may, without calling on the person to appear before it, issue a warrant for the person’s arrest.  
         
        
       (4) Subject to subsection (5), nothing in this section affects any right of appeal.  
       (5) For the purposes of an appeal under any Act against a penalty imposed in the exercise of a power conferred by this section, the time within which such an appeal must be made commences on the date on which the penalty is so imposed.  
       (6) In this section:  
       ""impose a penalty"" includes:  
        
         
         (a) impose a sentence of imprisonment or a fine, or  
         (b) make a periodic detention order, home detention order or community service order, or  
         (c) make an order that provides for an offender to enter into a good behaviour bond, or  
         (c1) make a non-association order or place restriction order, or  
         (d) make an order under section 10, 11 or 12, or  
         (e) make an order or direction with respect to restitution, compensation, costs, forfeiture, destruction, disqualification or loss or suspension of a licence or privilege.  
         
        
       
      
    15    Section 3 defines “court” as 
     
      
       
       ""court"" means:  
        
       (a) the Supreme Court, the Court of Criminal Appeal, the Land and Environment Court, the Industrial Relations Commission, the District Court or a Local Court, or  
        
       (b) any other court that, or person who, exercises criminal jurisdiction, 
       
      
    16    It is clear that any magistrate may deal with a sentencing error, or it may be sent back to the original sentencing magistrate if necessary or convenient. For example, where there is a defended hearing, and thus the facts upon which sentence was based are unclear, then it would ordinarily be appropriate to have the matter listed before the sentencing magistrate. In this case, the sentencing magistrate is located on the Kempsey circuit, and was visiting Sydney when Mr Jamieson’s matter was heard. Mr Jamieson does not have the means or desire to travel to Kempsey to have the matter heard, and enquiries have determined that the original sentencing magistrate will not be sitting here in the foreseeable future. I note further that there is no objection by the prosecution to this court re-sentencing the defendant, and accordingly, I have determined that I will deal with the matter forthwith.  
     
     What is the effect of any correction? 
    17    Mr Behan has foreshadowed a submission that I ought to re-sentence the defendant to a sentence pursuant to a s9 Bond. I have formed a preliminary view, subject of course to hearing from Mr Behan and from the prosecutor, that this sentence would not be adequate, and that a sentence of a suspended sentence is appropriate. I have further formed the preliminary view that the term of this suspended sentence ought to be less than the nine month maximum, as the defendant pleaded guilty, the reading was at the low end of mid range, there was a significant period between this and prior offences (eight years), and there were no additional aggravating factors. This then raises the issue as to when the sentence commences – i.e. is it backdated to the date of the sentencing error, or does it commence from today. In my view, the sentence is able to be backdated, and I have located examples where the Court of Criminal Appeal has taken the same view with custodial sentences – see for example Kwok v R (No 2) [2007] NSWCCA 314. 18    Further, the factors which the court may take in relation to re-sentencing include what has occurred since the date of the imposition of the original sentence. In Erceg v the District Court of New South Wales & & Virgin v the District Court of New South Wales & Anor [2003] NSWCA 379 (19 December 2003), McColl J found as follows at [107]:  
     
      
       
       Where a court is satisfied of the existence of either condition precedent and that the court should reopen the proceedings, it has a wide discretion in deciding what if any penalty should be imposed, save that it must be in accordance with the law. The judge in re-sentencing applies the law which existed at the time the original sentence was imposed and takes into account the circumstances of the offence or offences and the position at the time of the imposition of the original penalty. The judge must consider what has happened since that penalty was imposed and the circumstances which then exist. The court is not limited to the position as at the imposition of the original penalty:  
       R v Denning 
        (NSWCCA per Smart J, unreported, 15 May 1992); approved  
       R v Tangen 
        per Badgery-Parker J (with whom Gleeson CJ and Hidden JJ agreed), not following the more restrictive views of s 24 expressed by Kirby P and by Hunt CJ at CL in  
       Ho 
        and  
       Tolmie 
        respectively.  
       
      
    19    Thus it will next be necessary for me to hear submissions on the penalty now to be imposed for the previous offences and then for the fresh offences. Should I determine that a suspended sentence is appropriate, the term will be crucial. On my calculations, if it is any longer than seven months and seven days, then Mr Jamieson will be in breach of the s12 bond.  
     
     What are the appeal rights following correction? 
    20    It is clear from s43(4) and s43(5) that Mr Jamieson has a right of appeal following correction of sentence. I may need to adjourn the fresh matters if he exercises that right following the correction, particularly if there is a suspended sentence longer than seven months and seven days. 21    I will now hear submissions on sentence for the original offences.

     Judgment 
      
      
    1 McCOLL JA: The appellants, Peter McCrohon, Karin Bergseng and Christine Louise Perry, who are partners in a firm of solicitors practising in Sydney known as McCrohon Bergseng Partners, appeal from a judgment of Smart AJ in which his Honour found that they acted negligently, and in breach of their retainer and fiduciary duty, to the respondents, Paul Antoni Harith and Elizabeth Gay Kanuth, in their conduct of proceedings in the Supreme Court of Queensland (the “Queensland proceedings”).  
     
      
    2 The primary judge found that as a result of those breaches the respondents suffered loss in, and in relation to, the costs of the Queensland proceedings in three respects. First, $250,000 in respect of the costs they were ordered to pay to John Beale, the defendant in those proceedings as a result of an adjournment of the trial (the “adjournment costs”). Secondly, $22,694 in respect of a decrease in the party-party costs recoverable by the respondents from the defendant in the Queensland proceedings by reason of their bill of costs having to be converted from New South Wales assessable form into Queensland taxable form (the “party-party costs”). Thirdly, $9000 in relation to the costs the respondents incurred in objecting to the bill of costs in relation to the adjournment costs delivered by Mr Beale in the Queensland proceedings. His Honour entered judgment against the appellants for $395,845.46 (including interest) plus costs: Harith & Kanuth v McCrohon [2009] NSWSC 111 (the “primary judgment”). 3 The respondents also sought at trial to recover damages representing the difference between the amount they paid the appellants for solicitor-client costs and the amount of solicitor-client costs they alleged they would have paid if they had been advised to use, and had used, solicitors admitted in Queensland (the “solicitor-client costs”). The primary judge rejected that claim. 
     
      
    4 The appellants do not challenge the liability findings. The appeal relates only to the first two heads of damages. The respondents cross-appeal in relation to the primary judge’s refusal to award them damages in respect of their solicitor-client costs claim. To avoid confusion I will refer to the parties as the appellants and respondents even when dealing with the cross-appeal. 
     
      
    5 At the commencement of the appeal the Court ordered pursuant to Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW), 7.10(2)(a) that the appeal continue in the absence of a representative of the estate of the first respondent, he having died recently. 
     
      
       
      The Queensland proceedings 
       
      
    6 In the Queensland proceedings the respondents sought a declaration that Mr Beale held land at Airlie Beach known as “Cool Palms” in trust for them. Airlie Beach is in the vicinity of the town of Mackay in North Queensland. The Queensland proceedings appear to have been commenced in the Mackay Registry of the Supreme Court of Queensland. The appellants, who were not admitted to practice in Queensland, acted for the respondents. The respondents were successful: see Harith & Kanuth v Beale [2003] QSC 411. 
     
      
    7 The background to the Queensland proceedings is set out in the primary judgment in this appeal as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “8. Until late in 2002 the plaintiffs, who were then husband and wife and have since divorced were ordinarily resident in Florida, USA. In September 1999 they visited the Whitsunday area in North Queensland and stayed with Mr John Beale. Mr Beale and Ms Kanuth had been friends for about 27 years. The plaintiffs expressed a desire to acquire property and settle in or near Airlie Beach. One of the properties they looked at was ‘Cool Palms’. In about November 2000 Mr Beale telephoned Ms Kanuth and told her that Cool Palms was for sale. The subsequent history is set out in the judgment of Dutney J, delivered 5 December 2003. At the time of trial Mr Beale was the registered proprietor of Cool Palms. At the conclusion of the trial (15-18 September 2003) Dutney J made orders declaring the property to be held on trust for the plaintiffs but restraining the plaintiffs from dealing with the property other than by mortgaging it in favour of Howard Mortgage Finance Pty Ltd for an amount not exceeding $750,000. The remaining issue was the amount, if any, for which Mr Beale was entitled to be indemnified. On 5 December 2003 Dutney J entered judgment for Mr Beale against the plaintiffs for $31,929.03 together with interest of $2,926.83.” 
        
       
      
    8 In order to understand the claim for the adjournment costs it is necessary to explain what happened before the final trial of the Queensland proceedings. 
     
      
    9 The Queensland proceedings were set down for trial on 25 July 2003. On that day the respondents sought, and were granted, an adjournment. Costs of the adjournment were reserved.  
     
      
    10 The trial proceeded before his Honour Justice Peter Dutney in Mackay on 15 - 18 September 2003. Judgment was delivered in the respondents’ favour on 5 December 2003. Dutney J ordered Mr Beale to pay the respondents’ costs of the trial (the “trial costs”). In respect of the reserved adjournment costs, Dutney J found (at [57]) that the adjournment was “solely as a result of the plaintiffs' stated inability to fund their legal representation for the trial notwithstanding the attendance in Mackay on that day of counsel, a solicitor from Sydney and a solicitor from the Sunshine Coast as well as a town agent. Dutney J made orders in relation to the adjournment costs as follows (primary judgment at [9]):  
     
      
       
        
         “7. The plaintiffs to pay the defendant’s costs thrown away by the adjournment on 25 July 2003 to be assessed on an indemnity basis. 
        8. Declare that such costs include all legal costs and outlays incurred by the defendant up to and including 12 September 2003, except costs and outlays necessarily incurred for the drafting and filing of pleadings, complying with the defendant's obligations in relation to disclosure, costs reserved on 24 June 2003, July 2003 and the interlocutory hearing in April 2003.” 
        
       
       
      The party-party costs 
       
      
    11 In due course the respondents delivered a bill of costs for $189,288.10 in respect of the trial costs to Mr Beale. The bill was prepared on a time based costing in accordance with the New South Wales rules for such bills. Upon objection by Mr Beale a Queensland registrar ruled the New South Wales bill should be withdrawn and prepared in accordance with the Queensland scale. The result of converting the New South Wales bill to one in which fees were charged on a task basis in accordance with the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 1999 (Qld) was to reduce the party-party bill of costs to $166,593.35 and hence to reduce the amount the respondents could recover from Mr Beale by $22,694.75: see primary judgment (at [165] – [167], noting that within this section paragraphs numbered [163] – [166] appear for the second time in the judgment).  
     
      
      The adjournment/trial costs 
       
      
    12 At some stage not explained in the primary judgment but, according to counsel for the appellants, during the assessment process being undertaken in respect of one or both parties’ bills of costs, the respondents and Mr Beale agreed to quantify trial costs at $150,000 and the adjournment costs at $250,000. They then agreed to set off the trial and adjournment costs. Accordingly, the respondents paid Mr Beale $100,000 representing the agreed quantification of the two costs orders. 
     
      
    13 Despite the agreement as to Mr Beale’s trial costs, and the consequent set-off of that agreed amount against the adjournment costs, the respondents successfully claimed at trial $22,694, representing the amount by which their original bill of costs for the trial costs was reduced as described above. The appellants did not demur to this claim on the basis that that loss had been waived by and/or merged in the set-off costs agreement. It appears, accordingly, that that agreement was made without prejudice to the respondents’ right to claim the $22,694 referred to above. 
     
      
       
      The instant proceedings 
       
      
    14 The respondents put their case at trial in two ways. 
     
      
    15 First, insofar as the adjournment costs were concerned, they alleged the appellants breached their duty of care, their retainer and their fiduciary duty by taking action precipitating the withdrawal of counsel without reasonable notice (the “reasonable notice claim”). Such reasonable notice, it was asserted, would have allowed the respondents to engage fresh counsel or fresh solicitors, enabling the hearing to proceed: par 22, amended statement of claim.  
     
      
    16 The respondents claimed damages, both at common law and in equity, which they alleged flowed from the breaches of duty in respect of the adjournment costs. They asserted (at pars 23(a) - (e) of the amended statement of claim):  
     
      
       
        
        “(a) The Plaintiffs were ordered to pay Beale's costs thrown away due to the July 2003 adjournment on an indemnity basis (less some exceptions), i.e. from the start of the proceedings to 12 September 2003 and those costs were agreed at $250,000.00. 
         
         
        (b) Beale was ordered to pay the Plaintiff's costs (less a few exceptions) from the start of the proceedings to the trial date of 18 September 2003 on a party/party basis and those costs were agreed at $150,000.00. 
         
         
        (c) The Plaintiffs paid Beale $100,000.00 being the difference between the agreed costs. 
         
         
        (d) The Plaintiffs lost the opportunity of recovering their costs from Beale being agreed at $150,000.00.  
         
         
        (e) Therefore the loss to the Plaintiffs as a result of the Defendants' breaches in regards to the July 2003 adjournment was $250,000.00.” 
        
       
      [The primary judge refers (at [137] – [138]) to the respondents’ damages claims as being set out in paragraph 20 of the amended statement of claim. I assume this is a typographical error as the only copy of such a document in the Red Book sets out the claim in paragraph 23 and in like terms to those to which the primary judge refers.] 
      
    17 Secondly, the respondents alleged in relation to the party-party and solicitor-client costs claims, that in breach of their fiduciary duty and retainer, the appellants failed fully to disclose the consequences of their not being admitted to practice in Queensland, in particular, the effect their not being entitled to conduct the Queensland proceedings might have on both the respondents’ ability to recover costs, and on the costs they would incur (the “non-disclosure claim”). Insofar as that allegation was concerned the respondents claimed, relevantly, the following losses (paras 24, 25, amended statement of claim):  
     
      
       
        
        “24 (a) the difference between the amount the Defendants charged the Plaintiffs for the litigation compared to the amount Queensland solicitors would have charged for the same work, the difference being the amount of $117,823.16 or such other amount as the Court finds. 
        
       
       
        
        (b) the Plaintiffs lost the amounts taxed off the New South Wales bills as a result of their being put into Queensland form by Order of Registrar Smith made 9 November 2004 such difference being $23,625.65 or such other amount as the Court finds.” 
        
       
      and 
       
        
        “25 (a) … the costs incurred in converting the format of the New South Wales bills of costs into the form pursuant to the Legal Profession Act 1982 New South Wales and then to the format prescribed by the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules Queensland when such conversions would not otherwise occurred”. 
        
       
       
      Paragraph 24(a) was the solicitor-client costs claim. Paragraph 24(b) was the party-party costs claim. 
       
      
    18 The respondents claimed “damages” and “equitable damages” in respect of the losses they alleged. 
     
      
       
      Primary judgment 
       
      
    19 The respondents knew the appellants were not admitted to practice in Queensland. As to their complaint that they were unaware of the ramifications of this, the primary judge found (at [125]): 
     
      
       
        
        “If the plaintiffs had been fully appraised of the costs consequences of MBP conducting litigation in Queensland and acted logically, in their financial circumstances, they would have retained Queensland solicitors, possibly based in Brisbane. While I have some reservations whether the plaintiffs would have acted logically especially in view of Ms Kanuth's confidence in Ms Perry, the probabilities are that after a full explanation and consideration of their own finances and reflecting on those they would have retained Queensland solicitors. They were in no position to incur costs which were not recoverable.” 
        
       
      
    20 His Honour held (at [126]) in relation to the non-disclosure claim, that the defendants had failed to explain fully to the plaintiffs the costs consequences of using Sydney, rather than Queensland, solicitors to conduct the Queensland proceedings and (at [134]) that this was a breach of their retainer.  
     
      
    21 Insofar as the adjournment costs were concerned the primary judge found (at [130]) that: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the plaintiffs had been alerted in early July 2003 that if the case did not go ahead on and from 24 July 2003 and they sought an adjournment there was the possibility that an adjournment would be refused and their case dismissed or that an adverse costs order would be made against them that could result in a substantial amount being payable, the plaintiffs would have been able to redouble their efforts to borrow the moneys the defendants required or apply for an adjournment at an earlier date.” 
        
       
      
    22 His Honour concluded (at [132]):  
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion the defendants failed in their duty to the plaintiffs in altering the terms of counsel's terms engagement 2 days before the hearing in Mackay was due to commence and on the eve of counsel's departure from Brisbane to Mackay and in not bringing matters to a head by not later than 8 July 2003. If matters had been brought to a head by such earlier date and Mr McCrohon had decided to proceed and take security there would have been sufficient time for the plaintiffs to have obtained independent legal advice as to execution of the documents prepared by Mr McCrohon.”  
        
       
      
    23 The primary judge held (at [133]), in relation to the reasonable notice claim, that the failure of the appellants to give reasonable notice such as would have allowed the respondents to engage fresh counsel or fresh solicitors for the hearing to proceed constituted a “breach of an implied term of the retainer”. His Honour noted that if he was wrong in that view, the respondents were entitled to rely on a breach of the appellants’ duty of care. His Honour also found in respect of this claim, that the appellants breached the fiduciary duties they owed to the respondents as “[i]t is part of a solicitor's fiduciary duties to advance the interests of the clients and not prefer their own interests” and this “involves not changing the terms of counsel's engagement at the last minute so as to precipitate the withdrawal of counsel immediately before the hearing and thereby force an adjournment at great cost to the clients.”  
     
      
    24 The respondents do not challenge his Honour’s findings as to the nature of the appellants’ breaches, in particular the fact that he confined his finding as to the appellants’ breach of duty in respect of the non-disclosure claim to one of breach of retainer and did not find the breach of fiduciary duty pleaded in the amended statement of claim.  
     
      
    25 Turning to damages, the primary judge first dealt with the respondents’ claim that as a result of the appellants’ breaches in relation to the adjournment, they lost the opportunity to recover the trial costs of $150,000 from Mr Beale and that, taken with the amount they paid Mr Beale ($100,000), their loss was $250,000. The primary judge rejected this claim. The evidence before his Honour established that, by the time of the trial of the Queensland proceedings, Mr Beale was impecunious, having exhausted all his financial resources preparing for the adjourned July trial: primary judgment (at [139]). There was no evidence of Mr Beale’s financial position at the time of the trial before the primary judge. However his Honour concluded (at [142]) that it was improbable that the respondents would ever have been able to recover their costs of the Queensland proceedings (i.e. the trial costs) from Mr Beale, so that that lost opportunity had no real, and at best nominal, value. The respondents do not challenge this finding. 
     
      
    26 The respondents also submitted that there was another basis on which they should be able to recover the sum of $250,000 representing the liability they incurred in respect of the adjournment costs. The primary judge acceded to that application (at [143] – [144]) as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “143. The plaintiff also put their claim on a second basis. They submitted that as a result of their application for and the granting of an adjournment and the orders of Dutney J the plaintiffs became liable to pay the defendants $250,000. It was immaterial that there was a set-off of $150,000 being the amount due to them by Beale. That was a matter of mechanics. The plaintiffs' liability to pay $250,000 arose from the conduct of the defendants. A distinction has to be drawn between the liability to pay and the manner in which that liability was satisfied. It should not be overlooked that Beale was unable to meet his liability to pay.  
        144. I take the view that the defendants are liable for the amount the plaintiffs were bound to pay the defendants [Mr Beale], namely $250,000.” 
        
       
      
    27 The primary judge then dealt with the party-party costs claim made in respect of the decrease in the respondents' party-party costs in the Queensland proceedings by reason of those costs being converted from NSW assessable form into Queensland taxable form. 28 His Honour held (at [165] – [167], recalling that within this section paragraphs numbered [163] – [166] are repeated) that the reduction from the New South Wales amount to the Queensland amount flowed from the appellants not fully explaining to the respondents the costs consequences of using Sydney solicitors rather than local solicitors in Mackay (or possibly Rockhampton, where part of the proceedings were heard). Accordingly his Honour allowed (at [167]) that item of damage at $22,694. 
     
      
    29 Finally, the primary judge allowed the respondents $9000 being the costs they incurred in objecting to the bill of costs Mr Beale delivered in the Queensland proceedings in respect of the adjournment cost (at [173(b)], [179] – [180]). The appellants do not challenge this award.  
     
      
       
      The cross-appeal: solicitor-client costs 
       
      
    30 The respondents also claimed $117,823 at trial in respect of the solicitor-client costs claim. They sought to establish the quantum of that claim by tendering a notional solicitor-client bill of costs (exhibit “MAG2”), prepared by Mr Garrett, a Queensland solicitor who practised as a legal costs consultant. Mr Garrett had acted for the respondents in relation to the costs assessments which flowed from Dutney J’s costs orders. Accordingly he was not an independent expert witness properly so-called, but one who gave evidence about certain factual matters not presently relevant, as well as preparing MAG2. He was, however, apparently treated as an expert witness insofar as he carried out that task, and signed the Code of Conduct Expert Witness. There is no suggestion he did not discharge the obligations of such a witness. 
     
      
    31 MAG2 purported to set out what a firm of solicitors based in Mackay would have charged the respondents for acting in relation to the Queensland proceedings ($189,220) compared to what the appellants had charged ($307,043): see primary judgment (at [149]). MAG2 proceeded on at least two premises which the appellants challenged: first, that, if properly advised, the respondents would have engaged solicitors who practised in Mackay; and, secondly, that those solicitors would have charged the respondents on a task basis, on which, according to Mr Garrett, items are charged close to the Queensland Supreme Court Scale, rather than on a time-cost basis.32 The primary judge set out (at [144]) the approach taken by Mr Garrett, whose “experience, knowledge of costing matters and skill” he considered to be “impressive”: 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) he attempted to calculate the plaintiffs' solicitor and client costs on the basis that they retained solicitors admitted in Queensland who were practising in Mackay instead of the defendants; and 
         
         
        (b) he started with exhibits [MAG1] (the plaintiffs' Standard Costs Bill against Beale) and DJS-5 (Summary of the NSW Solicitors Fees Incurred Based on the Queensland Supreme Court scale); and 
         
         
        (c) he deleted items that appeared in both MAG1 and DJS-5 that were duplicated services (i.e. done by both agent and principal) because had the plaintiffs retained solicitors admitted in Queensland who were practising in Mackay instead of the defendants, there would have been only principal solicitors, no agents and hence no duplicated services; and 
         
         
        (d) he deleted items that appeared in either MAG1 and DJS-5, that were services provided by Sunshine Coast solicitors, because had the plaintiffs retained solicitors admitted in Queensland who were practising in Mackay instead of the defendants, the Mackay solicitors would not have had to retain Sunshine Coast solicitors. From Mr Garrett's examination of the files, the work done by the Sunshine Coast solicitors was limited to receiving instructions from the defendants and then in turn giving instructions to agents in Mackay; and 
         
         
        (e) he calculated the costs for the remaining items using the rates specified in his affidavit of 12 January 2007, being the rates charged by a medium sized firm in Mackay which conducts litigation routinely in the Supreme Court in North Queensland; and 
         
         
        (f) Finally, he created an itemised solicitor and client bill reflecting this process, being exhibit MAG2 totalling $189,220.” 
        
       
      
    33 As I have said, the appellants challenged the utility of MAG2 in the light, in particular, of the following submissions. They submitted that even if the respondents had retained a Queensland solicitor, there was no evidence that they would have retained solicitors based in Mackay. They also submitted that Mr Garrett's opinion lacked a proper factual foundation. This was because, they contended, solicitors in Queensland are free to enter into costs agreements with their clients which can specify that all work is to be charged on a time, rather than task, basis and there was nothing to prevent Mr Garrett from costing the respondents’ likely fees, even if Mackay solicitors were engaged, on a time-cost basis: see primary judgment (at [152]).  
     
      
    34 Mr Garrett accepted he could have prepared MAG2 on a time-costed basis, but said he did not do so because of the difficulty of unravelling the overlapping of work, for example as between work in fact done by Queensland solicitors retained as the appellants’ agents and the appellants: primary judgment (at [148]). Mr Garrett also accepted that if the plaintiffs had retained Brisbane solicitors some charges would have been required for a town agent closer to Mackay and the deductions he made concerning the agency fees of Mackay solicitors retained by Sunshine Coast solicitors could not be recovered: primary judgment (at [151]). 
     
      
    35 MAG2 also included costs for tasks which Mr Garrett described as:  
     
      
       
        
        “[N]ot necessarily required for the litigation but which related to the Plaintiffs’ claim against the property known as Cool Palms for example FIRB [Foreign Investment Review Board] applications, re-financing applications and the like.” 
        
       
      
    36 As to these amounts, the primary judge observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “155. I raised with Senior Counsel for the plaintiffs whether they were entitled to claim for items not connected with the litigation, such as the FIRB application. Senior Counsel accepted that he could not claim for work done in relation to the FIRB application. He said (at T183, lines 35-36) ‘…we do not claim anything that is not connected with the litigation in Queensland, nor could we do so.’ Senior Counsel had the understanding that Mr Garrett excluded any items for non litigious work. When MAG2 is examined this does not appear to be the position. See, for example, Items 29, 32, 73, 75, 77. 
         
         
        …. 
         
         
        157. Ms Perry's affidavit details that MBP did a great deal of work in relation to the plaintiffs’ FIRB application over many months. Ms Perry also had extended contact with Loan Solutions and Westpac as to the financing of the loan for the property.” 
        
       
      
    37 The primary judge rejected the claim for solicitor-client costs, concluding the evidence did not enable him to quantify the amount payable in relation to this head of damage. His Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “160.  
        Mr Garrett's exercise, although helpful, gives rise to some problems. While I have found that, if the costs consequences had been fully explained the plaintiffs should have instructed Queensland solicitors, those instructed could well have been located in Brisbane and this would have involved a Brisbane firm using a Mackay agent. 
        **  
        It is probable that the plaintiffs would have been asked to execute a Costs Agreement permitting costs and fees to be charged on a time basis as the arrangements between Beale and the plaintiffs were messy and a little involved. There were also the FIRB and migration issues. The issues raised could also have led to the Mackay solicitors seeking a Costs Agreement permitting time based charging even though task based charging was usual in Mackay. 
        161. A considerable amount of time was spent by MBP in endeavouring to secure payment of monies for their costs and to put them in funds to meet counsel's fees, Queensland agents' fee and disbursements. 
        162. While there may well be solicitor/client costs paid by the plaintiffs to MBP which would be recoverable the evidence does not enable me to quantify the amount which is payable. I have given consideration to making a broad estimate but that would not be fair given that time based charging would probably have to be considered along with the retention of Brisbane based solicitors and isolating the work that was fairly referrable to the Court action. 
        163. A difficult issue would arise as to any claim for solicitor/client costs as to aspects of the Deed of Security*** in the light of the events of 22-23 July 2003 and separating these from the Deed of Security which was later executed. 
        164. On the evidence as it stands I am not persuaded that I should make any allowance for this item as I am not able to quantify the amount that should be allowed with any degree of reliability.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
       
      ** It will be recalled that the primary judge had earlier found (at [125]) that if the respondents had been fully informed of the costs consequences of retaining New South Wales solicitors to conduct the litigation in Queensland, they would have retained Queensland solicitors “possibly based in Brisbane”.  
       
       
      *** The Deed of Security was apparently a document the appellants required the respondents to execute in relation to legal costs: see primary judgment at [51], [55], [72]. Neither party sought to explain the difficulties his Honour contemplated by his reference (at [163]) to the Deed of Security. 
       
      
    38 The respondents did not challenge any of paragraphs [155] and [160] – [162] in the notice of cross-appeal as originally filed. As shall become apparent, they sought to do so after the appeal was heard. I will return to this. 
     
      
       
      Issues on appeal and cross-appeal 
       
      
    39 The appellants appeal from the primary judge’s findings as to the adjournment and the party-party costs, complaining that (a) the primary judge erred in finding that they were liable to pay to the respondents the sum of $250,000 having regard to his Honour’s findings that Mr Beale was impecunious and that the opportunity the respondents lost to recover their costs of the Queensland proceedings had no real value (Ground 1); and (b) the primary judge erred in finding that, even if the appellants did not fully explain to the respondents the cost consequences of using Sydney solicitors rather than Mackay or possibly Rockhampton solicitors, the respondents’ conduct should be regarded as a material cause of the loss (Ground 2).  
     
      
    40 The respondents cross-appeal against the primary judge’s refusal to award them damages in respect of their solicitor-client costs claim. The appellants have in turn filed a notice of contention submitting his Honour’s refusal to award damages in this respect was justified on five other grounds – only two of which (grounds 3 and 4) were addressed in written submissions.  
     
      
      Submissions: appeal 
       
      
    41 The substance of the appellants’ submission in relation to both grounds of appeal ultimately was that the primary judge erred in failing to take into account in the assessment of damages the circumstances at the time of trial, including Mr Beale’s impecuniosity.  
     
      
    42 Mr S A Kerr of Senior Counsel, who appeared with Mr T J Breakspear for the appellants on appeal and at trial, contended in relation to the adjournment costs claim that the respondents did not suffer a loss of $250,000 because they never paid that amount to Mr Beale. As to the $150,000 representing the agreed value of the trial costs order of which the respondents were the beneficiary, Mr Kerr argued that the respondents would never have been able to recover this amount from Mr Beale given the primary judge’s findings concerning his impecuniosity. Accordingly, he submitted, the only damages which flowed from the primary judge’s findings that the appellants breached their duty in relation to the adjournment costs issue was the $100,000 the respondents paid Mr Beale in agreed set-off of the adjournment costs and the trial costs orders. The award of $250,000, he contended, was a windfall. 
     
      
    43 Insofar as the party-party costs claim was concerned, the appellants’ written submissions complained that the primary judge erred in concluding that the respondents suffered loss flowing from the lack of an explanation as to the consequences of using Sydney rather than Queensland legal practitioners. In short they contended that the primary judge’s conclusion was based on the fallacy that, had the respondents retained Queensland legal practitioners, those legal practitioners would have charged on a task-costed basis, rather than, as the appellants had done, on a time-costed basis. The written submissions also contended that while the evidence established that some Mackay solicitors charged costs based on tasks undertaken, the weight of the evidence was that Queensland solicitors charged on a time-costed basis. Accordingly the appellants contended, as the primary judge found (at [125]), that if properly advised the respondents would have retained a Brisbane-based legal practitioner, and (at [160]) a practitioner who would have asked them to execute a costs agreement permitting costs and fees to be charged on a time-costed basis. Any bill of costs such a practitioner prepared in relation to the party-party costs would have been prepared on the same basis as the appellants’. In such circumstances a reduction in the Queensland practitioner’s bill of costs would have occurred in any event because Queensland costs assessors appraise bills of costs on a task-costed basis.  
     
      
    44 In oral argument Mr Kerr accepted that this ground of appeal could also be dealt with on the same basis as the adjournment costs, that is to say, that as Mr Beale was impecunious so that no party-party costs could, in any event, have been recovered from him, the primary judge erred in awarding damages under this head. 
     
      
    45 Mr B R McClintock of Senior Counsel, who appeared for the respondents with Mr Doyle Gray on appeal and at trial, submitted that the consequence of the adjournment costs order was that the respondents immediately incurred a liability to Mr Beale in that amount ultimately quantified at $250,000 – a liability they would not have incurred if the appellants had not breached their duty. He contended that Mr Beale’s impecuniosity, and the way in which the respondents subsequently discharged the liability, by set-off against the favourable costs order against Mr Beale, was irrelevant to the determination of the “loss” that the respondents suffered when the adjournment costs order was made. He contended that Mr Beale’s impecuniosity was only relevant to the respondents’ claim that as a result of the appellants’ breaches, they had lost the chance to recover their trial costs from Mr Beale. 
     
      
    46 Further, Mr McClintock sought to argue on appeal that there was no basis upon which the sum of $250,000 could be set off against the favourable costs order against Mr Beale. He pointed to the fact that Dutney J, in a telephone hearing on 3 November 2004, confirmed that there would be two parallel costs orders: one whereby the respondents recover their costs on the standard basis and one where Mr Beale recovers the same costs on the indemnity basis, as his Honour was of the view that Mr Beale was entitled to all costs he incurred back from the plaintiffs on the indemnity basis: see primary judgment (at [11]). Mr McClintock contended that the effect of the parallel costs orders was that the two orders stood by themselves and could not be set off against each other. 
     
      
    47 Insofar as the party-party costs were concerned, Mr McClintock’s written submissions contended the appellants did not adduce any evidence that a bill of costs prepared by Queensland legal practitioners who might have represented the respondents would have been reduced in the manner the appellants’ bill had been. He argued, even though the evidence was that Queensland legal practitioners charged on a time basis, Queensland bills of costs such as that submitted for taxation on Mr Beale’s behalf were prepared “in the usual format in Queensland where the items are not bulked together”: see primary judgment (at [150]). Accordingly he argued it was open to the primary judge to infer that any bill of costs prepared by Queensland legal practitioners who might have represented the respondents would have been prepared in a manner which accorded with Queensland practice and would not have been subject to the adverse taxation the appellants’ bill suffered.48 Mr McClintock accepted in oral argument that if the appellants were successful as to their argument in relation to the adjournment costs that damages had to be assessed at the time of trial, they would also succeed on that point in relation to the party-party costs issue. 
     
      
       
      Consideration: the appeal 
       
      
    49 As I have said, the primary judge found (at [132] – [133]) that the appellants breached their retainer, alternatively their duty of care, and their fiduciary duty in the circumstances which led to the respondents incurring the adjournment costs order. Neither party suggested that the respondents’ damages might differ depending on the cause of action – rather they assumed they were the same - an assumption which may not always be sound: HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd [2004] HCA 54; (2004) 217 CLR 640 (at [14]) (Full Court).  
     
      
    50 Damages awarded for breach of contract may, for example, differ from those in tort because of rules of remoteness or the terms of the contract: Astley v Austrust Ltd [1999] HCA 6; (1999) 197 CLR 1 (at [60]) per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ. Damages awarded in tort may differ from those awarded for breach of contract because of the availability of apportionment in cases of tort, but not contract, or because of the operation of contributory negligence legislation: see generally Astley v Austrust Ltd; cf Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW), s 5A. 
     
      
    51 If the remedies did differ depending on the cause of action the respondents should be able to take advantage of the most advantageous remedy: Henderson v Merrett Syndicates Ltd [1994] UKHL 5; [1995] 2 AC 145 (at 194) per Lord Goff of Chieveley, referred to with apparent approval in Astley v Austrust Ltd (at [84]) per Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ; see also HTW Valuers (at [14]). From the reasons that follow it will be apparent that in this case nothing relevantly turned on the different causes of action. 
     
      
    52 The object of an award of damages, in the case of a tort, is to put the injured plaintiff in the position in which he or she would have been if the tort had not occurred (Todorovic v Waller [1981] HCA 72; (1981) 150 CLR 402 (at 412) per Gibbs CJ and Wilson J; Johnson v Perez [1988] HCA 64; (1988) 166 CLR 351 (at 355) per Mason CJ); and in the case of breach of contract, in the position in which he or she would have been had the contract been performed: Gates v City Mutual Life Assurance Society Ltd [1986] HCA 3; (1986) 160 CLR 1 (at 11- 12) per Mason, Wilson and Dawson JJ; (as to contract see also Tabcorp Holdings Ltd v Bowen Investments Pty Ltd [2009] HCA 8; (2009) 236 CLR 272 (at [13]) (Full Court); European Bank Limited v Robb Evans of Robb Evans & Associates [2010] HCA 6; (2010) 264 ALR 1 (at [11]) (Full Court)). 
     
      
    53 An injured plaintiff is not entitled to make a profit in an action in tort or contract; in other words, to be awarded damages for a loss never suffered (Wertheim v Chicoutimi Pulp Co [1911] AC 301 (at 307 – 308) per Lord Atkinson) or, in the case of contract, to be placed in a superior position to that which he or she would have been in had the contract been performed: The Commonwealth of Australia v Amann Aviation Pty Ltd [1991] HCA 54; (1991) 174 CLR 64 (at 82) per Mason CJ and Dawson J.54 The general rule is that ""damages for tort or for breach of contract are assessed as at the date of the breach"" – the date of breach rule: Johnson v Perez (at 367) quoting Miliangos v George Frank (Textiles) Ltd [1976] AC 443 (at 468) per Lord Wilberforce. However, the general rule is not rigid and “will yield if, in the particular circumstances, some other date is necessary to provide adequate compensation”: Johnson v Perez (at 367) per Wilson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ; (at 370 – 371) per Brennan J; (at 386 - 387) per Dawson J; see also Golden Strait Corporation v Nippon Yusen Kubishika Kaisha [2007] UKHL 12; [2007] 2 AC 353. As Campbell JA (with whom Macfarlan JA and Sackville AJA agreed) said recently, referring to Johnson v Perez, the “certainty of [the] principle concerning the time as at which damages are assessed has now been eroded”: Gagner Pty Ltd trading as Indochine Cafe v Canturi Corporation Pty Ltd [2009] NSWCA 413; (2009) 262 ALR 691 (at [51]). 
     
      
    55 The general rule is flexible because the object of the award (and assessment) of damages is to give an injured plaintiff that amount in damages which will most fairly compensate for the wrong suffered: Johnson v Perez (at 355 – 356) per Mason CJ; (at 367) per Wilson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ; (at 371) per Brennan J; (at 380) per Deane J; (at 386) per Dawson J. What will amount to “fair” compensation has to take into account what is fair to the defendant as well as the plaintiff: Narni Pty Ltd v National Australia Bank Ltd [2001] VSCA 31 (at [29]) per Tadgell JA, Buchanan and Chernov JJA agreeing. 
     
      
    56 Accordingly, the general rule will yield if, at the time damages are assessed, the court is aware of new and material facts relevant to the assessment because courts prefers actual facts to speculation, prophecies, conjecture and guessing: Willis v Commonwealth [1946] HCA 22; (1946) 73 CLR 105 (at 109) per Latham CJ; Bwllfa and Merthyr Dare Steam Collieries (1891) v Pontypridd Waterworks Co [1903] AC 426 (at 431) per Lord MacNaghten, cited with approval by Wilson, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ in Nikolaou v Papasavas Phillips & Co [1989] HCA 11; (1989) 166 CLR 394 (at 404); Kizbeau Pty Ltd v WG & B Pty Ltd [1995] HCA 4; (1995) 184 CLR 281 (at 293 - 295) (Full Court); HTW Valuers (Central Qld) Pty Ltd v Astonland Pty Ltd (at [38] – [40]) (Full Court). 
     
      
    57 In Golden Strait, in December 2001 charterers repudiated a charterparty of a ship due to run until mid-2005. The owners accepted the repudiation and sought to recover damages. On 20 March 2003 the Iraq war broke out. It was agreed between the parties that this was an event which would have entitled the parties to cancel the charter under the war provision (cl 33) of the charterparty. The owners argued that because the charterers' repudiation and their acceptance of it preceded the March 2003 event, the rule requiring damages for breach of contract to be assessed at the date of breach required that event to be ignored. The House of Lords rejected that argument by majority (Lord Bingham of Cornhill and Lord Walker of Gestingthorpe dissenting).  
     
      
    58 Lord Scott of Foscote (with whom Lord Carswell and Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood agreed and with whom, in turn, Lord Scott also agreed), said (at [30]): 
     
      
       
        
        “30 If a contract for performance over a period has come to an end by reason of a repudiatory breach but might, if it had remained on foot, have terminated early on the occurrence of a particular event, the chance of that event happening must, it is agreed, be taken into account in an assessment of the damages payable for the breach. And if it is certain that the event will happen, the damages must be assessed on that footing. In  
        The Mihalis Angelos 
         [1971] 1 QB 164, 210, Megaw LJ referred to events ‘predestined to happen’. He said that  
         
         
          
          ‘… if it can be shown that those events were, at the date of acceptance of the repudiation, predestined to happen, then … the damages which [the claimant] can recover are not more than the true value, if any, of the rights which he has lost, having regard to those predestined events.’ 
          
         
         
        Another way of putting the point being made by Megaw LJ is that the claimant is entitled to the benefit, expressed in money, of the contractual rights he has lost, but not to the benefit of more valuable contractual rights than those he has lost.” 
        
       
      
    59 Accordingly, Lord Scott rejected (at [32]) the owners’ contention, describing it as attributing “to the assessment of damages at the date of breach rule an inflexibility which is inconsistent both with principle and with the authorities.” While his Lordship accepted the date of breach rule usually put the victim of a breach of contract in the same position, so far as money could do it, as if the contract had been performed (the “compensatory principle”), his Lordship did not accept that that was universally so. In his view (at [38]) the owners’ argument offended the compensatory principle, because they were seeking compensation exceeding the value of the contractual benefits of which they were deprived. This was because their case required “the assessor to speculate about what might happen over the period 17 December 2001 to 6 December 2005 regarding the occurrence of a clause 33 event and to shut his eyes to the actual happening of a clause 33 event in March 2003.” 
     
      
    60 In equity, too, a defendant is only liable for the consequences of the legal wrong he or she has done to the plaintiff and to make good the damage caused by such wrong. Damages was not an equitable remedy for breach of purely equitable obligations, such as breach of fiduciary duty: Meagher, Gummow and Lehane, Equity Doctrines & Remedies, 4th ed (2002) Butterworth’s LexisNexis (at [23-005]). In the case of a beach of fiduciary duty, the court has an inherent power to grant relief by way of monetary compensation: United States Surgical Corp v Hospital Products International Pty Ltd [1982] 1 NSWLR 766 (at 816) per McLelland J. The object of equitable compensation is to restore persons who have suffered loss to the position in which they would have been if there had been no breach of the equitable obligation: O'Halloran v R T Thomas & Family Pty Ltd (1998) 45 NSWLR 262 (at 272) per Spigelman CJ, referring to Nocton v Lord Ashburton [1914] AC 932 (at 952) per Viscount Haldane LC. While the plaintiff is to be put in the same position as he or she would have been in if the wrong for which equitable compensation is awarded had not been sustained, the defendant is not liable to pay compensation which exceeds the loss suffered from such wrong: Target Holdings Limited v Redferns (a firm) [1996] 1 AC 421 (at 432) per Lord Browne-Wilkinson, cited with approval in O'Halloran (at 272).  
     
      
    61 However unlike the general rule in contract and tort, the rule in equity is that the determination of the quantum of any pecuniary remedy for breach of equitable duty falls for determination “at the time of trial, using the full benefit of hindsight”: Canson Enterprises Ltd v Boughton & Co [1991] 3 SCR 534 (at 555) per McLachlin J, cited with approval by the Full Court in Youyang Pty Ltd v Minter Ellison Morris Fletcher [2003] HCA 15; (2003) 212 CLR 484 (at [35]; see also at [50]); see also Target Holdings (at 439) as to the use of hindsight and common sense in determining causation in assessing equitable compensation, approved in O'Halloran (at 273). 
     
      
    62 Thus in Target Holdings, the plaintiff was held not to be entitled to recover damages from its solicitors who were found to have acted in breach of trust in paying out trust moneys prematurely, contrary to the plaintiff’s instructions to transfer those moneys only when a commercial property had been conveyed to a mortgagor and the mortgagor had executed charges in favour of the plaintiff. Subsequently, the property was conveyed to the mortgagor and the charges executed. However, on the plaintiff’s exercise of its power of sale, the mortgaged property turned out to be worth far less than the amount prematurely disbursed by the solicitors. The House of Lords rejected the plaintiff’s argument that events subsequent to the solicitors’ breach of trust were to be disregarded and that the defendants had to restore the entirety of the monies transferred prematurely. Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed (at 436):  
     
      
       
        
        "" 
        To impose such an obligation in order to enable the beneficiary solely entitled (i.e. the client) to recover from the solicitor more than the client has in fact lost flies in the face of common sense and is in direct conflict with the basic principles of equitable compensation 
        . In my judgment, once a conveyancing transaction has been completed the client has no right to have the solicitor's client account reconstituted as a ‘trust fund’.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    63 As noted by the Full Court in Youyang v Minter Ellison (at [47]), in approving Lord Browne-Wilkinson’s reasoning, it was significant that the solicitors’ breach of trust left the plaintiff in exactly the same position as if there had been no breach. If the instructions had been obeyed, the transaction would still have gone ahead and the plaintiff would have suffered a loss represented by the difference between the amount advanced on security and the amount realised from the security. That loss would have been caused by the fraud of third parties. 
     
      
    64 If the date of breach rule was applied to determine the loss the respondents suffered as a result of the adjournment costs order then it might be accepted that they suffered a loss of $250,000. 
     
      
    65 However, with respect to the primary judge, to award that sum without having regard to the fact the respondents only paid $100,000 to discharge their liability in respect of that costs order was to proceed without regard to the proper application of the compensatory principle – as applied in respect of each of the respondents’ causes of action. It was not to the point that in consequence of the adjournment costs order the respondents immediately incurred a liability to Mr Beale ultimately quantified at $250,000. Applying the proposition that “fair” compensation takes into account what is fair to the defendant, as well as the plaintiff (see Narni at [29], above at [54]), and that a defendant is not liable to pay compensation which exceeds the loss suffered, the primary judge ought to have taken into consideration that the only amount the respondents actually paid to discharge the adjournment costs order was the sum of $100,000. 
     
      
    66 It is equally not to point if, as Mr McClintock submitted, the two costs orders could not be set off as a matter of law, when that, in fact, is what happened. As is apparent from the foregoing discussion, the Court must take material facts into account when assessing damages. The fact the respondents paid only $100,000 to discharge their liability under the adjournment costs order was a material fact the primary judge ought to have taken into account. 
     
      
    67 Accordingly, in my view, the primary judge erred in awarding the respondents $250,000 in respect of the adjournment costs claim. 
     
      
    68 The same reasoning applies to the claim for party-party costs. That was really an aspect of the respondents’ pursuit of the trial costs order they secured against Mr Beale. If, as the evidence revealed, at the time of the trial in this Court, it was apparent the respondents could not recover the benefit of that order from the impecunious Mr Beale (which was the logic of his Honour’s rejection (at [142]) of the respondents’ claim to recover damages for their lost opportunity to recover the trial costs), then they have suffered no loss in the reduction in the amount sought in converting the bill proposed to give effect to that order into Queensland format. Or, to put it another way, the loss they suffered in this respect was not caused by the appellants’ breaches of duty, but by Mr Beale’s impecuniosity. Accordingly, in my view, the primary judge erred in awarding the respondents $22,694 in respect of the party-party costs claim. 
     
      
    69 On that basis the appellants should succeed on both grounds of appeal. It is not necessary to deal with the appellants’ alternative submission in relation to ground 2 regarding whether Brisbane based solicitors would have charged on a time cost basis.  
     
      
      Cross-appeal – submissions  
      
    70 At the core of Mr McClintock’s submissions on the cross-appeal as originally framed, was his reliance on the primary judge’s finding (at [162]) that “there may well be solicitor/client costs paid by the plaintiffs to MBP which would be recoverable”, and his criticism of his Honour’s conclusion that, nevertheless, “the evidence does not enable me to quantify the amount which is payable.” He contended that, as the first statement amounted to a finding that the respondents had suffered loss as a result of the non-disclosure, the primary judge erred in making the latter finding and, in any event, in not assessing damages “as best as he could”. 
     
      
    71 Mr McClintock first submitted that the evidence supported the proposition that the appellants’ failure to give full disclosure of the costs consequences of using Sydney solicitors “caused the [respondents’] loss”. He pointed to Mr Garrett’s evidence that translating the respondents’ New South Wales formatted party-party costs bill into Queensland format led to a reduction in the claimable amount of $22,694. He contended that MAG2 was evidence to which the primary judge could refer in quantifying the respondents’ loss. He argued that the differences between the assumptions on which MAG2 was based and the facts as found by the primary judge, were not sufficient to justify his Honour’s complete failure to award any damages. 
     
      
    72 Secondly, Mr McClintock contended that the primary judge’s statements to the effect that the respondents may “possibly” (at [125]) or “could well have” (at [160]) engaged Brisbane solicitors fell short of a definite finding that the respondents failed to establish one of the factual premises of MAG2. 
     
      
    73 Thirdly, Mr McClintock argued that as the only criticism the primary judge made of the preparation of MAG2 was that Mr Garrett erroneously included items unrelated to the litigation such as the FIRB and migration issues, damages could have been quantified by “the simple task” of extracting from Mr Garrett’s assessment the items that could not be claimed. While Mr McClintock accepted that it would have been difficult for the primary judge to have excluded items from MAG2 which did not relate to the Queensland proceedings, he argued that it was incumbent upon his Honour to undertake that exercise. 
     
      
    74 Finally, Mr McClintock submitted that as the primary judge did not find his clients were “not worse off” by reason of the appellants’ breach of retainer, his Honour ought to have taken a “broad rule of thumb approach” to the assessment of damages. On that basis he contended his Honour should either have awarded $117,823.16 (the bottom line of MAG2) or a significant proportion of that sum, “say $100,000”. 
     
      
    75 Mr Kerr contended that the primary judge found that the respondents had not established the factual foundation for MAG2 and, accordingly, there was no evidence which could enable him to quantify the loss, if any, the respondents had suffered. He submitted that the primary judge’s statements (at [125], [160]) were supported by the evidence and meant one of the factual assumptions for MAG2 had been rejected. 
     
      
    76 Secondly, Mr Kerr argued that the primary judge also properly rejected MAG2 because it was based on the unproven assumption that any Queensland solicitor the respondents might have engaged would charge on a task costed basis. He pointed to evidence he contended supported the primary judge’s finding that it was more probable that Queensland solicitors would have charged on a time costed basis. 
     
      
    77 Finally, Mr Kerr submitted that there was no basis on which the Court could award the respondents either the amount set out in MAG2 or their alternative figure of $100,000. He contended the latter figure had been “merely plucked from thin air” and that “[a]ny other figure would be drawn from the same space.” 
     
      
    78 Mr Kerr also relied on the appellants’ notice of contention in the following two respects. First, he submitted that the primary judge’s conclusion that the respondents had failed to establish any quantifiable loss flowing from the non-disclosure was also open on the basis the respondents failed to adduce evidence that, properly advised, they would have used Queensland rather than New South Wales solicitors. Secondly, he contended the primary judge ought to have found Mr Garrett could have prepared MAG2 on the basis of what Mackay solicitors would have charged on a time costed basis. 
     
      
       
      Cross-appeal: supplementary submissions 
       
      
    79 In the course of oral argument the Court expressed concern about the respondents’ submission that the primary judge could, and should, have excised from MAG2 the items for non-litigious work: cf primary judgment [155]. While Mr McClintock submitted the amounts were “trivial”, he acknowledged that MAG2 – which was not then in the appeal papers – was a substantial document. He informed the Court that the respondents did not challenge his Honour’s conclusion that those amounts were irrecoverable – accepting that he had informed the primary judge that the respondents “could not get anything that was not connected with the litigation”. He did not challenge Mr Kerr’s indication that the respondents had not given his Honour any assistance as to how to disentangle such amounts from MAG2. Nevertheless, as I have said, he submitted that his Honour could have quantified the loss “by the simple task of extracting out of the amounts the small amounts for FIRB”. 
     
      
    80 The Court gave the respondents leave to file and serve submissions explaining the approach they contended the primary judge ought to have taken to extract the “non-litigious work” items from MAG2; quantifying the amounts his Honour ought on that approach to have subtracted from the bottom line figure in MAG2 and the sum for the solicitor–client costs claim his Honour ought to have derived as a result of that exercise; and showing where, if at all, a submission had been made at trial as to how his Honour ought carry out such an exercise. 
     
      
    81 Mr Kerr objected to the respondents being given that leave, arguing they should not be able to conduct the appeal on a different basis to the approach taken at trial. He was invited to address both this question and issues of costs in respect of the matters on which the respondents had been given leave in his written submissions in response.82 The respondents filed supplementary submissions. Contrary to the express acceptance during the oral argument that MAG2 included “non-litigious” items, the supplementary submissions argued that MAG2 did not include any impermissible items. Rather, the supplementary submissions contended that in preparing MAG2, Mr Garrett excluded items that were not recoverable as costs of the Queensland proceedings. To the extent the primary judge found otherwise, the respondents sought leave to file an amended notice of cross-appeal (a document which had already been filed in the Registry on 17 November 2009), which added a ground 1(h) complaining that the primary judge: 
     
      
       
        
        “…erred at [155] and [162] in finding that work done in relation to the FIRB application was not connected with the litigation in Queensland, and consequently in finding that MAG2 included items that were not connected with the litigation in Queensland and were not recoverable by the Cross-Appellants.” 
        
       
      
    83 The supplementary submissions then sought to embark upon a detailed consideration of exhibits DJS2, DJS4, DJS5 and MAG1 (on which MAG2 was apparently based), to seek to demonstrate why Mr Garrett had already excluded non-recoverable items from MAG2. Copies of DJS2, DJS4, DJS5, MAG1 and MAG2 accompanied the supplementary submissions. 
     
      
    84 The supplementary submissions conceded that, on their face, DJS2, DJS5 and MAG1 each included items which might be thought not to have been connected with the Queensland proceedings and hence not recoverable “on a party-party basis as costs of the proceedings”. They then contended that, in fact, such items, which included costs in relation to FIRB approval and efforts by the respondents to refinance against the security of Cool Palms, were connected with the litigation and recoverable by the respondents and also (although the relevance of this was not apparent) by Mr Beale as the result of Dutney J’s orders. They referred, non-exhaustively, to numerous such items in DJS2, DJS4 and DJS5. 
     
      
    85 The supplementary submissions contended that the statement in Mr Garrett’s affidavit of 12 January 2007 (at [29]) that he had “included attendances which were not necessarily required for the litigation but which were related to the Plaintiffs’ claim against the property”, implied that costs associated with “FIRB applications, refinancing applications and the like” were connected with the Queensland proceedings. That implication was said to be reinforced by the statement in Mr Garrett’s affidavit of 26 September 2008 that MAG1 and DJS5, both of which included items relating to FIRB, refinancing and the like, were the starting point for the creation of MAG2. The supplementary submissions contended that such items properly formed part of taxable party-party costs both for Mr Beale and the respondents. It might conveniently be noted at this point that Mr Garrett’s affidavit does not include any express statement to the latter effect, but, rather, described DJS4 (for which MAG1 was the “corresponding Costs Statement”) and DJS5, in substance, as party-party bills of costs in form capable of assessment either in New South Wales or Queensland. 
     
      
    86 Finally, the supplementary submissions drew attention to the following exchanges between his Honour and Mr Garrett, and his Honour and Mr McClintock in the course of address, which, it was contended, demonstrated that the primary judge led himself into error: 
     
      
       
        
        “HIS HONOUR: 
        Q. In paragraph 29 you make a reference there to FIRB applications, Foreign Investment Review Board work, that’s fairly specialised work, isn’t it? 
        [Garrett] A. I wouldn’t have thought it was specialised work. It might be. I’m not too sure. I suppose it is. I’m not sure. I can’t actually remember what work they actually did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q. But making applications and processing something through the FIRB is a bit different from conducting ordinary litigation and ordinary conveyancing work, isn’t it? 
        A. I can’t actually recall, your Honour, what was involved in the application, filling in a form or making submissions on, but I can’t recall. Unless I see the file I don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        …… 
        
       
       
        
        HIS HONOUR:  
        
       
       
        
        Q. I had some real difficulty with the claim that you made in respect of the items such as the FIRB application. That didn’t seem to me to be at all connected with this litigation. 
        
       
       
        
        [McClintock] A. I am told Mr Garrett excluded those costs and there is no claim made for them. I am told – and this is confirmed in Mr Garrett’s affidavit – he worked off the bills for litigation and excluded any items for non-litigious work.  
        I accept I could not get work for FIRB. 
        
       
       
        
        If it is necessary, I will ask my learned junior to do a short note explaining what I have just said to your Honour and showing why we do not claim those matters and showing how Mr Garrett came to the figures in question. I think it is fairly clear, in fact, from Mr Garrett’s affidavit as to what he did. 
        
       
       
        
        I give your Honour a reference. It is the second affidavit, September 2008, paragraph 27. He says that he started with the two exhibits nominated there, MAG1 and DJS5. And he refers back to 14 and 16. Those two exhibits were the bills in the DJS5. DJS4 was the bill in New South Wales assessable form, DJS5 was the bill in Queensland form and MAG1 was the Queensland bill of costs for the litigation. Then your Honour will see the process that is set out there in paragraphs 28 and 29.  
        As I said, we do not claim anything that is not connected with the litigation in Queensland, nor could we do so. 
        ” (emphasis added)  
        [BLACK 188] 
        
       
      
    87 The supplementary submissions then contended that the primary judge may not have “erred as he did” if it had been put to Mr Garrett in cross-examination that he had erroneously included non-litigious items in MAG2, or if the primary judge had directly put such questions, if it had been apparent to Counsel for both parties that this issue should be followed up, or if his Honour had accepted the respondents’ offer of a written note. 
     
      
    88 The appellants submitted that the respondents should not be given leave to rely on their proposed amended cross-appeal nor on their supplementary submissions. They pointed out that the supplementary submissions did not address the questions upon which the Court invited assistance but, rather, advanced a new position contrary to that advanced before the primary judge and that put in oral argument during the hearing of the appeal. They complained that their consent had not been sought to the filing of the amended notice of cross-appeal and that such a document should not have been filed in the Registry without the Court’s leave. They submitted that to allow the respondents to amend their notice of cross-appeal following oral argument and to advance submissions beyond the scope of the leave granted was inconsistent with s 56 and s 57 of the Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW) and the practice in this Court, referring to Bull v Lee (No 2) [2009] NSWCA 362. 
     
      
    89 Next, the appellants complained that the respondents’ submission that work done in relation to the FIRB application should be considered to be connected with the Queensland proceedings was contrary to the position they took at trial. They drew attention to the primary judge’s reliance on Mr McClintock’s concession that the respondents could not get work for FIRB at trial. They pointed out that the respondents had not assisted the primary judge in the exercise of how he might extract non-litigious amounts from MAG2.  
     
      
    90 Next, the appellants made a number of submissions about the respondents’ reliance on DJS2, DJS4 and DJS6. In particular, they pointed out that DJS2, DJS4 and DJS5 were bills of costs in taxable/assessable form and there was no evidence that any of the FIRB related items were allowed following taxation – although it is unclear whether or not anything was taxed (see [12]) above, nothing turns on this. They submitted that the respondents’ submission that it could be “implied” that FIRB work was recoverable in the litigation had no foundation in fact and, further, was contrary to Mr Garrett’s evidence. 
     
      
    91 The supplementary submissions also identified in MAG1 agency fees said to amount to $1686.70, which it was said the respondents would have incurred had they retained solicitors based in Brisbane instead of Mackay, which they accepted should have been excluded from the claim for damages.  
     
      
    92 The appellants pointed out that MAG1 was a bill Mr Garrett prepared in Queensland taxable form containing all the work done by the Queensland agents. They complained that no submission was made at trial that the primary judge should have reviewed MAG1 and extracted particular agency related costs, let alone any submission as to the basis on which his Honour could have undertaken such an exercise. They complained that the respondents’ supplementary submissions were silent as to the methodology they applied to extract the sum of $1686.70. 
     
      
    93 The appellants submitted that there were many items of work in MAG1 which would have been the same on the hypothetical scenario that, properly advised, the respondents would have engaged Brisbane solicitors. They drew attention to two examples it is unnecessary to repeat and contended, again, that the respondents had failed to show what items in MAG1 actually represented a loss to them. 
     
      
       
      Cross-appeal: damages 
       
      
    94 The respondents bore the onus of proving on the balance of probabilities that they had suffered loss as a result of the appellants’ breach of retainer, as well as the quantum of the loss they had suffered: Commonwealth v Amann (at 80) per Mason CJ and Dawson J; (at 99) per Brennan J; (at 118) per Deane J; (at 137 – 138) per Toohey J. If they demonstrated that, properly advised, they would not have retained the appellants, but would have retained Queensland solicitors, they were entitled to “such damages as may reasonably be supposed to have been in the contemplation of both parties concerned at the time they made the contract as the probable result of the breach” (European Bank Ltd v Robb Evans (at [13])) – that question being determined by the terms of the retainer in the light of the matrix of circumstances in which it was made: Commonwealth v Amann (at 92) per Mason CJ and Dawson J; (at 99) per Brennan J. The respondents were entitled, accordingly, to recover as damages expenditure they wasted on account of the appellants’ breach of retainer: Commonwealth v Amann (at 81 - 82) per Mason CJ and Dawson J. However, as I have said (at [52]) they were not entitled to damages for a loss never suffered – or to put it in terms relevant to the argument in this case, for a loss or expense not incurred as a result of the breach of retainer. 
     
      
    95 To recover more than a nominal amount for breach of retainer the respondents had to “affirmatively establish assessable damage, that is to say, loss or injury which is capable of being measured in monetary terms”: Commonwealth v Amann (at 118) per Deane J. 
     
      
    96 A plaintiff who seeks to establish historical facts must attain the civil standard of proof – the balance of probabilities. However that standard of proof does not apply to a plaintiff who seeks to establish future possibilities and past hypothetical situations (such as what might have happened had the plaintiff not lost a chance) for the purpose of assessing damages: Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd [1990] HCA 20; (1990) 169 CLR 638 (at 639 – 640) per Brennan and Dawson JJ; (at 642 – 643) per Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ; Poseidon Ltd & Sellars v Adelaide Petroleum NL [1994] HCA 4; (1994) 179 CLR 332 (at 349 – 350). 
     
      
    97 Thus, where a breach of contract deprives a party to the contract of a chance, the loss of that chance is compensable, notwithstanding that, on the balance of probabilities, it is more likely than not that the plaintiff would not have turned the chance into reality: Sellars (at 349) per Mason CJ, Dawson, Toohey and Gaudron JJ. The usual illustration of this proposition is Chaplin v Hicks [1911] 2 KB 786 where the plaintiff, having proved a breach of contract by the promoter of a talent contest, recovered damages for losing the chance of winning an engagement as an actress.  
     
      
    98 In such cases, the court approaches the hypothetical situation in terms of the degree of probability of it occurring. The court does not require the plaintiff to demonstrate that, to use the present case as a model, there was a 51 per cent chance of the respondents briefing Queensland solicitors if they had been properly advised. Rather the court takes the chance of that having happened into account even if it falls below 50 per cent, as long as it is not “so low as to be regarded as speculative”. In such cases, the court “assesses the degree of probability that an event would have occurred, or might occur, and adjusts its award of damages to reflect the degree of probability”: Malec (at 643); see also Commonwealth v Amann (at 118) per Deane J; Sellars (at 349). 
     
      
    99 In Sellars, for example, the trial judge, Justice French (as his Honour then was) found that as a result of a misrepresentation made by the respondents in breach of s 52 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 (Cth), the applicant lost the opportunity to enter into a contract with a third party under which contract it would have secured greater benefits than it secured under a later contract. However his Honour was not persuaded that all conditions precedent to the lost contract’s performance would have been satisfied. Accordingly he discounted the benefits the applicant’s expert calculated would have flowed from the lost contract to 40 per cent to allow for the probability that the agreement would not have proceeded: Adelaide Petroleum NL v Poseidon Ltd (1990) 98 ALR 431; see Sellars (at 347). The respondents’ appeals to the Full Federal Court (Poseidon Ltd v Adelaide Petroleum NL [1991] FCA 663; (1991) 105 ALR 25) and the High Court against the award of damages on the loss of opportunity basis were dismissed. 
     
      
    100 As I said earlier in these reasons, the object of an award of damages for breach of contract is to place the respondents in the position they would have been in if the appellants had performed their retainer. If the respondents established that, properly advised, they would have retained solicitors who would have charged them less for representing them in the Queensland proceedings, they were entitled to recover as damages “expenditure they wasted on account of the appellants’ non-disclosure”: Commonwealth v Amann (at 82). 
     
      
    101 The respondents sought to discharge their onus of proof on damages by contending that, if properly advised, they would have retained Mackay solicitors who would have charged them $117,823.16 less than the appellants did, a figure they sought to establish by MAG2. 
     
      
    102 The appellants assert in their notice of contention that his Honour’s reasons in respect of this claim should be upheld because the respondents did not adduce evidence to establish that, if properly advised, they would have instructed Queensland, let alone Mackay, solicitors, rather than New South Wales legal practitioners. This submission was made to the primary judge.  
     
      
    103 In response, Mr McClintock submitted at trial that by virtue of s 5D of the Civil Liability Act 2002 (NSW) the respondents could not have led evidence as to what they would have done if properly advised. When the primary judge pointed out that s 5D in terms referred to “negligence”, Mr McClintock drew attention to the fact that the Civil Liability Act applied to all claims however framed if they can be said, in substance, to be a claim for damages for harm resulting from negligence. I assume he was intending to refer to s 5A(1) which provides that Pt 1A of the Civil Liability Act “applies to any claim for damages for harm resulting from negligence, regardless of whether the claim is brought in tort, in contract, under statute or otherwise”: see Booksan Pty Ltd v Wehbe [2006] NSWCA 3; (2006) Aust Torts Rep ¶81 – 830 (at [167]) per Ipp JA (Giles and Tobias JJA agreeing). Mr McClintock also referred to judicial observations about treating with caution, in failure to warn cases, evidence from the plaintiff about what he or she would have done if the defendant had acted otherwise. 
     
      
    104 The appellants did not as I understand their submissions at trial challenge Mr McClintock’s characterisation of the case as one to which the Civil Liability Act applied. On that basis s 5D precluded the respondents giving the sort of evidence of whose absence the appellants complained. But even if the Civil Liability Act did not apply, it should be borne in mind, as Campbell JA (Hodgson and McColl JJA agreeing) said in Kowalczuk v Accom Finance [2008] NSWCA 343 (at [319]) that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Even if such evidence had been given, the High Court’s warnings that evidence from the plaintiff about what he or she would have done if the defendant had acted otherwise should be treated with caution in cases where the complaint is failure to warn (

    105 In the passage from Rosenberg v Percival [2001] HCA 18; 205 CLR 434 to which Handley AJA referred, McHugh J observed (at [25]) that in a failure to warn case, “where there is no direct evidence as to what the patient would have done, the judge may infer from the objective facts that the patient would not have undergone the procedure.” 
     
      
    106 If s 5D applied, then factual causation was to be determined absent direct evidence from the respondents and “subjectively in the light of all relevant circumstances”: s 5D(3)(a), Civil Liability Act. The same approach was available at common law. Accordingly I would reject the ground 3 in the appellants’ notice of contention. 
     
      
    107 The primary judge set out (at [160] – [164]) a number of reasons for his conclusion that he was “not persuaded” that he should allow the solicitor-client costs claim. Critical to his Honour’s conclusion in this respect were his statements that it was possible the respondents would have engaged Brisbane solicitors, and that whichever solicitors they engaged may have charged on a time rather than a task basis. In my view in saying he was “not persuaded” his Honour found that the respondents had not established either of the key factual premises underlying MAG2. 108 However, with respect, it is not apparent that in reaching his conclusion that he was “not persuaded”, that his Honour considered the degree of probability or possibility that, in the past hypothetical situation his Honour was contemplating, the respondents may have used Mackay solicitors who charged on the task-costed basis which underpinned MAG2. The language his Honour used, of being “not persuaded”, is that of the civil onus of proof – a standard which, as I have explained is inapt when dealing with past hypothetical situations.  
     
      
    109 In my view his Honour’s findings supported the proposition that it was at least possible, in the sense of not being regarded as speculative, that the respondents may have used Mackay solicitors. I base this conclusion on his Honour’s findings that the respondents were in no position to incur costs which were not recoverable (at [125]), and, it might be inferred, would not wish to incur greater costs than they might otherwise be charged. 
     
      
    110 In addition, it might be noted that the second respondent (Ms Kanuth) gave evidence that she had a telephone conversation with Ms Perry two or three days after the appellants were first consulted in which the former suggested the respondents retain a lawyer in Airlie Beach as that would be easier. Ms Perry also said she did not know any lawyers in Airlie Beach and could only recommend firms in Brisbane. The respondents then approached two law firms in Airlie Beach each of which declined to act for them as they had previously acted for Mr Beale. Ms Kanuth then called Ms Perry and said she (I infer she was speaking on behalf of the other respondent) wanted her to handle the case. She did not ask for the names of Brisbane firms. At trial, the appellants’ written submissions drew attention to the fact that despite Mr Beale being based at Airlie Beach, he retained Brisbane solicitors.111 These were all objective circumstances to which the primary judge could have had regard in determining what the respondents would have done if properly advised. His Honour appears to have concluded it was possible the respondents would have engaged Brisbane solicitors because Mr Beale did so. The reason My Beale did so was not explained but the fact he used Brisbane solicitors did not, in my view, outweigh the evidence, for example, that the respondents’ first inquiries were directed to Airlie Beach solicitors. No doubt this was because Ms Perry suggested that course. However, taken with his Honour’s findings (at [125]), it was at least a possibility that the respondents would have used solicitors in Mackay, thus avoiding incurring agents’ fees.  
     
      
    112 It should also be borne in mind that a finding that it was possible the respondents would have used Brisbane solicitors, does not exclude the possibility that they would have used a Mackay firm. In the realm of lost opportunity, there may be a number of possibilities. As long as the court can be satisfied that it was possible that one of the courses for which the plaintiff contends would have been followed, other possible courses can be taken into account in assessing the degree of probability that the plaintiff would have adopted the course contended for. 
     
      
    113 In my view, having found (at [125]) the appellants would, if properly advised, have used Queensland solicitors, being in no position to incur irrecoverable costs (and, I infer, being in no position to incur costs they could avoid), his Honour ought to have concluded that it was possible they would have used Mackay solicitors, an opportunity they lost by reason of the appellant’s breach of retainer.  
     
      
    114 The position in relation to the basis on which the appellants might have been charged even if they had used Mackay solicitors, is not clear-cut. It is apparent, as the primary judge observed (at [160]) that the basis of charging would have turned on those solicitors’ assessment of the complexity of the case, the FIRB issues, the need for refinancing and the like – and that that would have led to such solicitors seeking to charge on a time-costed basis. However the possibility that Mackay solicitors would charge on a task-costed basis as Mr Garrett assumed, again, in my view, could not be excluded as speculative. As his Honour said (at [160]), task-based costing was usual in Mackay. 
     
      
    115 Accordingly, in my view, the primary judge erred in holding that his finding that the two factual premises underpinning MAG2 had not been established on the civil onus was the end of the enquiry. 
     
      
    116 It is unnecessary, however, to seek to quantify in Malec, Commonwealth v Amann and Sellars terms the probability that the respondents would have acted in the manner assumed by Mr Garrett in preparing MAG2. This is because, for the reasons which follow, I am of the view that the primary judge did not err in concluding (at [162]) that one of the reasons he could not make a broad estimate of the amount which may be recoverable was because he could not isolate the work “fairly referable to the Court action”. In short, MAG2 included items for non-litigious costs and the respondents did not identify for the primary judge (or in this Court) any basis upon which those amounts could be fairly and reliably isolated from the other amounts. 
     
      
    117 Mr McClintock originally contended that, despite his Honour’s concerns that MAG2 included items for non-litigious costs, his Honour ought nevertheless to have assessed damages on a “broad rule of thumb” basis. 
     
      
    118 There are cases in which courts will estimate damages despite a dearth of evidence. The basic principle was explained in Commonwealth v Amann (at 83) by Mason and Dawson JJ as follows:  
     
      
       
        
        “[M]ere difficulty in estimating damages does not relieve a court from the responsibility of estimating them as best it can:  
        Fink v Fink 
         (1946) 74 CLR 127 at 143;  
        McRae v Commonwealth Disposals Commission 
         (1951) 84 CLR 377 at 411–12;  
        Chaplin v Hicks 
         [1911] 2 KB 786 at 792. Indeed, in  
        Jones v Schiffmann  
        (1971) 124 CLR 303 at 308 Menzies J went so far as to say that the ‘assessment of damages… does sometimes, of necessity involve what is guess work rather than estimation’. Where precise evidence is not available the court must do the best it can:  
        Biggin & Co Ltd v Permanite Ltd 
         [1951] 1 KB 422, per Devlin J at 438.” 
        
       
       
      See also (at 102) per Brennan J, (at 118–119) per Deane J, (at 138) per Toohey J. 
       
      
    119 Devlin J’s complete statement in Biggin & Co Ltd v Permanite Ltd [1951] 1 KB 422 (at 438) was: “[W]here precise evidence is obtainable, the court naturally expects to have it. Where it is not, the court must do the best it can.” (emphasis added) After referring to this statement with apparent approval in State of New South Wales v Moss [2000] NSWCA 133; (2000) 54 NSWLR 536 (at [72]) Heydon JA added: 
     
      
       
        
        “As McPherson J said in  
        Nilon v Bezzina 
         [1988] 2 Qd R 420 at 424:  
        ‘The degree of precision with which damages are to be proved is proportionate to the proof reasonably available’ 
        . The courts on occasion cite in related contexts Bowen LJ’s related but stricter observation in  
        Ratcliffe v Evans 
         [1892] 2 QB 524 at 532-3, an injurious falsehood case:  
         
          
          ‘In all actions … on the case where the damage actually done is the gist of the action, the character of the acts themselves which produce the damage, and the circumstances under which these acts are done, must regulate the degree of certainty and particularity with which the damage done ought to be stated and proved.  
          As much certainty and particularity must be insisted on … in … proof of damage, as is reasonable, having regard to the circumstances and the nature of the acts themselves by which the damage is done.’ 
          ” (emphasis added) 
          
         
        
       
       
      These remarks should be read in the present case with the qualification that actual damage is not an element of the cause of action in contract:  
      Commonwealth v Amann 
       (at 16) per Deane J. 
       
      
    120 In JLW (Vic) Pty Ltd v Tsiloglou [1994] 1 VR 237 (a claim for damages for alleged misleading representation inducing entry into a lease) Brooking J reviewed the principles concerning the circumstances in which a court may assess damages notwithstanding a lack of evidence. His Honour referred (at 241 – 242) to the passage from Ratcliffe v Evans [1892] 2 QB 524 (at 532 - 3) cited by Heydon JA in Moss (at [72]), as meaning “the amount of the damage must be proved with certainty, but this only means as much ‘certainty’ as is reasonable in the circumstances”. His Honour distinguished cases such as Chaplin v Hicks where “[t]he nature of the damage may be such that the assessment of damages will really be a matter of [permissible] guesswork” from cases where “precise evidence is obtainable” (Biggin), where guesswork is not permissible. His Honour observed (at 243): 
     
      
       
        
        “There is no rigid dividing line between cases in which guesswork is permissible in assessing damages and cases in which it is not. The borderline between guesswork and rational assessment is itself indistinct, as is the line between evidence that is ""precise"" (the  
        Permanite Case 
         dictum)** and evidence that is not. In  
        Enzed Holdings Ltd v Wynthea Pty Ltd 
         (1984) 57 ALR 167, at 182-3, … the Full Federal Court thought the case to be one in which precise evidence of the loss was not obtainable, so that if the trial judge found that the plaintiffs had suffered some loss he must do his best to quantify the loss even if ‘a degree of speculation and guesswork’ was involved.” 
        
       
       
      **The “ 
      Permanite Case 
      ” is a reference to  
      Biggin 
      . 
       
      
    121 His Honour accepted (at 245 –246) the view expressed by Pincus J in Schindler Lifts Australia Pty Ltd v Debelak (1989) 89 ALR 275 (at 319) that “if the evidence called by the plaintiff fails to provide any rational foundation for a proper estimate of damages the court should simply decline to make one”. 
     
      
    122 In Troulis v Vamvoukakis [1998] NSWCA 237 (at 13) Gleeson CJ (Mason P and Stein JA agreeing) referred to Tsiloglou with approval as setting out the principles governing the approach a court should take when there had been a failure by a party carrying the onus to establish the extent of damage suffered as a result of a breach of contract or tort. Troulis was an action for damages pursuant to s 68 of the Fair Trading Act 1987 (NSW) in respect of the sale of a take-away food shop. The plaintiffs/purchasers established that the defendants/vendors had misrepresented the takings of the business and that that misrepresentation had induced them to purchase the business. The defendants were unsuccessful in challenging that finding on appeal. The damages to which the purchasers were accordingly entitled was the difference between what they had paid for the goodwill of the business and its true value at the date of purchase (Gleeson CJ at 8). There was no evidence of that value. Gleeson CJ held (at 13) that in such circumstances there were “limits to the lengths to which a court may properly go in ‘doing the best it can’ to assess damages”. His Honour observed that the case did not involve damages which were “inherently difficult to quantify, or which involve[d] estimating a risk, or measuring a chance, or predicting future uncertain events.” Although the plaintiffs/purchasers had not shown the goodwill was valueless, his Honour said (at 13) that it was necessary for them “to provide some evidence upon which a rational assessment of value could be made.” 
     
      
    123 Gleeson CJ concluded (at 14) in substance, that where the damages were susceptible of evidentiary proof, and there was “an absence of the raw material to which good sense may be applied … [j]ustice does not dictate that … a figure should be plucked out of the air.” 
     
      
    124 In Placer (Granny Smith) Pty Ltd v Thiess Contractors Pty Ltd [2003] HCA 10; (2003) 77 ALJR 768 (at [38]) Hayne J (Gleeson CJ, McHugh, and Kirby JJ agreeing) postulated that there may be a distinction between cases where a plaintiff cannot adduce precise evidence of what has been lost (in which “estimation, if not guesswork, may be necessary in assessing the damages to be allowed”) and cases where, although apparently able to do so, the plaintiff has not adduced such evidence. His Honour suggested that references to “mere difficulty in estimating damages not relieving a court from the responsibility of estimating them as best it can” might be more apt in the former rather than the latter class of case. 
     
      
    125 In Durban Roodepoort Deep Ltd v Newshore Nominees Pty Ltd [2005] WASCA 231 (at [39]) after referring to this passage from Placer (at [38]), McLure JA (as her Honour then was, and with whom Steytler P and Murray AJA agreed) observed: 
     
      
       
        
        “39. Cases of the former kind to which Hayne J referred would include claims where the loss was hypothetical or prospective: see  
        Malec v J C Hutton Pty Ltd 
         (1990) 169 CLR 638 at 643 per Deane, Gaudron and McHugh JJ. Cases where courts have awarded no, or only nominal damages, for insufficiency of evidence are collected and reviewed by the Court in  
        JLW (Vic) Pty Ltd v Tsiloglou 
         [1994] 1 VR 237 at 241–246.  
        In general terms, that outcome results where the relevant events on which proof of damage depends occurred prior to trial and the damage can be proved with relative precision. 
         
         
        40. The test of certainty stated in  
        McGregor on Damages 
        , 15th ed, at [344] is that damage must be proved with reasonable certainty and the standard of proof only demands evidence from which the existence of damage can be reasonably inferred and which provides adequate data for calculating its amount. That is a test of sufficient flexibility to accommodate the variety of circumstances that may arise.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    126 In Zorom Enterprises Pty Ltd v Zabow [2007] NSWCA 106; (2007) 71 NSWLR 354 Campbell JA accepted (at [82]) in some circumstances it was appropriate for a court assessing damages or compensation to adopt  
     
      
       
        
        “a figure which is little more than a guess, in circumstances where the evidentiary basis for adopting a particular figure is very thin, but where it would be wrong to use the thinness of the evidence as a reason for valuing that head of damages or item of compensation at zero.”  
        
       
       
      After referring to authorities, his Honour observed (at [84]) that: 
       
       
        
        “84. 
          
        The use of the word ‘guess’ in some of these authorities should not be taken as detracting from the obligation of the judge to adopt a reasoning process that has a rational basis, to the extent that the evidence presented, and the intrinsic nature of the materials and subject matter under consideration, permit.  
         In its ordinary meaning, ‘guess’ can extend to picking a number at random, and no judge is justified in guessing, in that sense, in assessing damages. Rather, the word ‘guess’ in these authorities recognises that sometimes such reasoning as is possible in the circumstances is far from compelling, and human beings have not been granted omniscience, but must make decisions on the basis of such incomplete knowledge as they have.” (emphasis added) 
         
        
       
      
    127 Mr McClintock submitted that the present circumstances were akin to those set out at [82] - [83] of Zorom v Zabow where damages should be awarded even where there was less than determinative evidence as to quantum. He submitted that the case fell within that class of case where the court is permitted to engage in a degree of speculation because of the hypothetical nature of the situation with which the solicitor-client costs claim was concerned. That submission was correct as I have already held insofar as the location of the alternate solicitors and the costs regime are concerned – although I would not characterise the conclusion the Court reaches in such instances as a product of “speculation” – rather than being the process of reasoning on a rational basis to which Campbell JA referred.  
     
      
    128 However the submission cannot be accepted insofar as the preparation of MAG2 was concerned. In my view this is a case where precise evidence of the damage the respondents had suffered as a result of the breach of retainer could have been adduced. It was not that class of case where precise evidence could not be adduced. It was also possible, as Mr Garrett accepted and the appellants submit in their notice of contention, for MAG2 to have been prepared on a time-costed basis, although this fact is not relevant having regard to my conclusion that a finding Mackay solicitors may have charged the respondents on a task basis was open. 
     
      
    129 The expression “solicitor and client costs” refers to the costs payable by the client to the solicitor on an assessment between them, sometimes referred to as “solicitor and own client costs”: Bouras v Grandelis [2005] NSWCA 463; (2005) 65 NSWLR 214 (at [18], [19]), per Giles JA; Basten JA agreeing. It is self-evident that costs of that nature are capable of precise proof. Accordingly it ought to have been possible for Mr Garrett to prepare MAG2 on a basis which excluded the non-litigious items. As I have said, the Court gave the respondents leave to file and serve further submissions addressing the “non-litigious” items issue.130 This brings me to the respondents’ supplementary submissions and the amended notice of cross-appeal bearing a court stamp indicating it was filed in the Court Registry on 17 November 2009.  
     
      
    131 The document should not have been so filed. Part 19 of the Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW) which deals with amendments applies to a notice of appeal in the same way it applies to the amendment of a statement of claim: UCPR 51.23. The rules relating to a notice of appeal extend to a notice of cross-appeal with necessary modifications: UCPR 51.3. Save as to the title of the document, there are no “necessary modifications” for the present purposes. UCPR 19.1 enables a plaintiff, without leave, to amend a statement of claim once within 28 days after the date on which it was filed but precludes a plaintiff, unless the court otherwise orders, from effecting an amendment after a date has been fixed for trial. 132 Accordingly, it was not open to the respondents to amend their notice of cross-appeal without leave, once the appeal was listed for hearing and, axiomatically, once the appeal had been heard. The amended notice of cross-appeal as filed, should, in my view, be treated as a nullity.  
     
      
    133 Further, I would refuse the respondents leave to amend their notice of cross-appeal. To give such leave would not facilitate the just, quick and cheap resolution of the real issues in the proceedings: s 56, Civil Procedure Act 2005 (NSW); see also Aon Risk Services Australia Ltd v Australian National University [2009] HCA 27; (2009) 239 CLR 175. The proposed amended notice of cross-appeal and the supplementary submissions in support of it put forward a new position not explored at trial about whether the FIRB application (and matters such as financing the acquisition of the property) was connected to the litigation. The respondents should not be able to raise these issues for the first time on appeal: Suttor v Gundowda [1950] HCA 35; (1950) 81 CLR 418 (at 438).134 The respondents’ supplementary submissions in support of the proposed new ground 1(h) ought also not be entertained for the following reasons. 
     
      
    135 I have already set out the basis upon which the Court granted leave to the respondents to file further written submissions. In short, the point on which the Court sought further assistance was as to how the respondents contended the primary judge could, and should, have excised from MAG2 the items for non-litigious work. As will be apparent from the summary of the supplementary submissions I have set out above, those submissions do not address that point. Rather, they seek to challenge the proposition which was, in my view, accepted both at trial and on the hearing of the appeal, that MAG2 did contain non-litigious items and that the respondents could not recover damages to the extent that MAG2 included such items. Mr Garrett himself described the FIRB and refinancing applications as “not necessarily required for the litigation but which related to the Plaintiffs’ claim against the property”.136 A similar situation arose in Notaras v Waverley Council [2007] NSWCA 333; (2007) 161 LGERA 230 (Special leave refused: Notaras v Waverley Municipal Council [2008] HCATrans 232). In that case, Tobias JA (with whom Mason P and Hodgson JA agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “147. As leave to file the final submissions was neither sought nor granted, authority requires that they should be ignored …:  
        Carr v Finance Corporation of Australia Ltd [No 1] 
         (1981) 147 CLR 246 at 258 per Mason J;  
        In the matter of an application by the Chief Commissioner of Police (Vic)  
        [2005] HCA 18; (2005) 79 ALJR 881 at 890 [53]-[54] per Kirby J;  
        Dwyer v Commonwealth of Australia  
        (1995) 31 ATR 48;  
        Kirwan v Cresvale Far East Ltd (In liq)  
        [2002] NSWCA 395; (2002) 44 ACSR 21 at [340] per Young CJ in Eq;  
        Chapmann v Caska  
        [2005] NSWCA 113 at [19] per Beazley, Giles and Tobias JJA. As Mason J said in  
        Carr  
        and Kirby J in  
        ex parte the Commissioner of Police 
        , the notion that supplementary submissions can be filed without leave is misconceived and this is so even if the other party to the proceedings consents. It should not occur.” 
        
       
      
    137 This statement applies with equal force to supplementary submissions which do not address the issue for which leave to make further submissions was given. In Bull v Lee (No 2) [2009] NSWCA 362, after extracting the passage from Notaras set out above, the Court (Allsop P, Campbell and Young JJA) added: 
     
      
       
        
        “9. The effect of making submissions after judgment has been either delivered or reserved, that go beyond the scope of any leave that has been granted is not confined to having those submissions ignored. Counsel should understand that it is a breach of their professional responsibilities to the Court to seek to make submissions that go outside the scope of the leave that has been granted. For counsel to act in that way seeks to undermine the important principle that, save in the most exceptional  
         
        circumstances, all arguments relating to an appeal should be put at the one time. It has the capacity to cause waste of the Court’s time, and both waste of time and expense for counsel’s opponent in deciding what to do about the submissions that have been made without leave.” 
        
       
       
      Cross-appeal: conclusion  
       
      
    138 The respondents’ failure to address the issue on which the Court sought assistance in relation to MAG2 means the Court is in no better position than the primary judge was in isolating the non-litigious costs from those which could properly be said to have been incurred as a result of the breach of retainer. To accede to the respondents’ submission that the Court adopt a broad rule-of-thumb approach would involve impermissible guesswork. 
     
      
    139 I would dismiss the cross-appeal. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    140 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
      1. Appeal allowed with costs. 
       
        
       
      2. Order that order 1 of the orders made on 23 March 2009 by Smart AJ in the Court below be varied so that the respondents have judgment in the sum of $152,691.97 together with interest thereon from 20 March 2009 accordance with section 101 of the  
      Civil Procedure Act 
       2005 (NSW). 
       
        
       
      3. Order that order 2 of the orders made on 23 March 2009 by Smart AJ in the Court below be varied so that the appellants pay the respondents’ costs in the Court below as agreed or assessed on the ordinary basis other than those costs incurred by the respondents in relation to the award of damages in the amount of $22,694 for the decrease in the plaintiffs’ party-party costs. 
       
        
       
      4. Cross-appeal dismissed with costs. 
       
      
    141 The orders will be entered forthwith in the court’s computer system: UCPR 36.11. Any notice of motion to vary them must be filed within 14 days of such entry: UCPR 36.16(3A).

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 THE COURT: On 31 March 2010 the Court dealt with this application of leave to appeal and made orders in respect of a sentence imposed for an offence contrary to s 400.6(1) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) that had the effect of quashing the sentence imposed in the District Court for that offence and in substitution dismissing the offence pursuant to s 19B(1)(c) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth). These are the reasons for making those orders. 
     
      
    2 The applicant had pleaded guilty in the Local Court to six offences contrary to the provisions of the Copyright Act 1968 (Cth) (the “decoder offences”) concerning the sale of, or offering to sell, unauthorised decoders. The relevant provisions were ss 135ASB(1) and 135ASC(1) of that Act. He also pleaded guilty to an offence contrary to s 400.6(1) of the Code (the “Code offence”). That section is concerned with dealing in the proceeds of crime. The decoder offences each carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 5 years. The Code offence carried a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. 
     
      
    3 As a result of the pleas of guilty he was sentenced in the District Court by Sorby DCJ (“the Judge”) on 9 June 2009. For the two offences contrary to s 135ASC(1) (offering for sale) he was sentenced to two concurrent terms of imprisonment each of three months and each to be served by way of periodic detention. Those sentences commenced on 25 June 2009 and expired on 24 September 2009. For the four offences contrary to s 135ASB(1) (selling) he was sentenced to four concurrent terms of imprisonment for six months each to be served by way of periodic detention. Those sentences commenced on 25 September 2009 and expired on 24 March 2010. For the Code offence, he was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of 20 months to be served by way of periodic detention. That sentence commenced on 25 December 2009 and was to expire on 24 August 2011. In respect of that sentence the Judge ordered the applicant’s release after serving 12 months of the sentence upon entering a recognizance pursuant to s 20(1)(b) of the Crimes Act (Cth). This meant that the applicant would be entitled to be released on 24 December 2010. 
     
      
    4 The effective sentence imposed was 26 months imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention with a minimum period of imprisonment of 18 months. 
     
      
    5 The applicant challenged only the sentence imposed for the Code offence. 
     
      
    6 The facts can be stated very briefly. The applicant offered to sell, or did sell, a number of unauthorised decoders on six occasions during 2008. A decoder is a device that enables the owner to obtain pay television services without paying a subscription fee to a service provider, in this case Foxtel, Austar and United Broadcasting International. On 6 November the applicant sold to an undercover police officer 50 decoders and received payment of $15,000 in cash. He placed the money in his vehicle but it was recovered immediately after his arrest. One of the charges under s 135ASB(1) referred to the sale of the 50 decoders and the Code offence related to the $15,000. 
     
      
    7 The Judge said the following before imposing the sentences upon the applicant: 
     
      
       
        
         
        I now turn to the appropriate sentence. The offences were not ""one offs"" or isolated incidents but were the receipt of a deliberate course of action for financial gain. There was a continual course of conduct that is the repeated sale of unauthorised goods or offering for sale such items. As I said earlier, in relation to all offences, general deterrence is an important consideration. The offences are prevalent and hard to detect. A strong message needs to be sent to like-minded persons of the community that such activities face condign punishment. 
         
         
        In setting the appropriate sentence for each offence and the ultimate penalty I am obliged to impose a sentence that ensures the offender is adequately punished for the offences. 
         
         
        The objective seriousness of the offences must be balanced by consideration of subjective factors in the offender's behaviour, including his standing in the community, his strong family and work history. 
         
         
        Following  
        Pearce 
         I am obliged to set a penalty for each offence before considering such questions as concurrency and acumulation, or whether the sentences should be partly both and the question of totality. 
        
       
      
    8 With respect, in light of these statements, it is difficult to understand how his Honour structured the sentences in the way he did. The four offences under s 135ASB(1) each received a sentence of six months. This is notwithstanding that his Honour had indicated he was giving the applicant a discount of 20 per cent for his early plea of guilty. It is difficult to determine what the starting sentence was before the discount was applied. But in any event his Honour imposed the same sentence for the sale of one decoder as he did for the sale of 50 decoders. Yet clearly the criminality could not be the same. Further, all of the sentences were made concurrent, notwithstanding that they were separate and distinct offences committed over a period of nine months. No application of appropriate sentencing principles could permit that result. 
     
      
    9 His Honour then imposed the sentence for the Code offence. The sentence imposed was 20 months imprisonment for a single offence that on any view was the result of the criminality involved in the sale of the 50 decoders for which the applicant had been sentenced to six months imprisonment. Again it is difficult to determine what was the starting sentence for the offence before the discount of 20 per cent was applied. The overall sentence is 26 months after a discount of 20 per cent. Once more there seems to be a disconformity between the sentence and the discount. 
     
      
    10 The applicant filed three grounds of appeal. The first was that the sentence for the Code offence was disproportionate to the criminality involved in the offence. The second ground was that in imposing the sentence for the Code offence his Honour failed to apply the principle of totality. The third was that the sentence for the Code offence was manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    11 In effect the complaint by the applicant was that the gravamen of his criminality was in the sale of the decoders not in the receipt of $15,000. It was submitted that the receipt of the money was “part and parcel” of the sale of the decoders. It was noted that his Honour never differentiated the Code offence from the decoder offences except in the sentence imposed and does not explain how his comments, set out in the passage above, can be relevant to the Code offence. It was submitted that the Judge failed to give any reason explaining why the criminality of having $15,000 received from the sale of the decoders was so much more serious than the sale itself so that it could justify a sentence that was over three times longer than the sentence imposed for the sale. 
     
      
    12 The Crown in written submissions emphasised that this Court should be concerned with the overall sentence imposed and not how it was structured. The submission was that this Court should find no lesser overall sentence was warranted for the offences for which the applicant was sentenced: see s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). Considerable reliance was place upon a passage in the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288 at [25]. That was a Crown appeal and says nothing about the operation of s 6(3). More recent authority, Arnaout v R [2008] NSWCCA 278; 191 A Crim R 149 indicates that the operation of that section is not free from doubt as evidenced by the conflicting views in the judgments of Basten JA and Price J. The dispute is whether s 6(3) refers to a particular sentence or the overall sentence imposed upon the applicant. For reasons that will become apparent we do not need to enter into that debate. 
     
      
    13 We believe that there is considerable merit in the complaints made by the applicant. However, they do not go far enough. In our view the whole sentencing exercise miscarried principally because the applicant should never have been charged with the Code offence. Had he sought to have that charge permanently stayed as an abuse of process we cannot see how the application could have been refused. 
     
      
    14 In Thorn v R [2009] NSWCCA 294 this Court raised concerns about the use of the section in the circumstances of a person who was engaged in taxation fraud. As well as being charged with the actual fraudulent conduct, he was also charged with an offence involving dealing with the money obtained by the frauds. In that case the activity was merely accessing the funds that he had derived from the frauds. The sentencing judge in that case failed to appreciate the nature of the criminal activity involved in what was called “the money laundering offence” and sentenced the applicant to an excessive sentence for that offence. As in the case now before the Court, the offence to a certain extent concerned the profits of the applicant’s own criminality and resulted in a miscarriage of justice. However, unlike the present case, there was some justification for the money laundering offence because it captured criminality of the applicant’s co-offender, who had never been charged and yet was involved in a joint criminal enterprise with the applicant. 
     
      
    15 In Thorn Howie J, who delivered the principal judgment of the Court, stated at [27]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        This was an unusual use of a money laundering offence. To the extent that there was an overlap with the fraud offences the charge represented the use of the funds that had been dishonestly obtained under those offences. The criminality was very much in the obtaining of the funds not in their use. It is somewhat analogous to a robber being sentenced for both the robbery and being in possession of the stolen goods. But in the present case, according to the maximum penalties prescribed, the money laundering offence was more serious than the frauds by which the money was obtained. Further the money laundering charge was used to punish the applicant for his criminality arising from his partner's fraudulent conduct. As was noted earlier, there is no concept of a joint criminal enterprise under the  
        Code 
        , so the applicant could not be charged with his partner's fraudulent activity even though it was common activity of them both. 
         
        
       
      
    16 In the present case we can see no justification whatever for the applicant being charged with the Code offence. In relation to the 50 decoders the criminality was in the sale as a result of which the owners of the services were deprived of their financial entitlement to rental charges for their use. The concept of a “sale” necessarily involves the seller obtaining some financial gain from the transaction. The receipt of the money was merely an element of the offence under s 135ASB(1). 
     
      
    17 We appreciate that a person can by the one act commit two offences and, where the two offences address different aspects of the criminal conduct, there is nothing wrong with prosecuting the two offences or, subject to the principle of totality, with imposing separate sentences for the two offences. But in our view the receipt of the money as a result of the sale did not result in a separate act of criminality that warranted a separate charge and a separate penalty. We do not believe that there is anything in Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 that conflicts with the view that we have taken as to the inappropriateness of the prosecution of the Code offence as well as the decoder offence; see particularly at [31]. We believe that in the circumstances of this case it was oppressive to charge the applicant with both the sale of the decoders and the receipt of the money as a result of the sale. That is because in our view the offence of sale encompassed the criminality of possessing the proceeds of the sale. 
     
      
    18 The Crown at the hearing of the appeal sought to argue that the two offences were aimed at different policies. The Code offence was intended to punish the possession of the proceeds of crime however they are obtained and the fact that the proceeds of the crime were in the public domain and could be dealt with or passed on to others. We accept that this may be a justification for the prosecution of such an offence particularly where the source of the funds is unknown, or where the proceeds were derived from the criminal act of another person or where the person is in some way dealing with the proceeds in order to hide their source or change the nature of the proceeds. But we cannot believe that it was the intention of Parliament that the offence should extend to the facts of the present case notwithstanding the width of the offence under the Code. 
     
      
    19 It is in our opinion not irrelevant that the Code offence carries twice the maximum penalty prescribed for the sale offence, which on any view was the principal act of criminality. It was never the intention of the investigators that the applicant should keep the money he obtained from the sale. If the police officer intended at the time of handing over the money also to charge the applicant with an offence relating to the possession of the money, it was a clear case of entrapment. The applicant could have been arrested before the money was handed over and charged with an offence under s 135ASC(1) of offering to sell the 50 decoders. The maximum penalties for the offence of offering to sell a decoder and the offence of selling a decoder are the same. We do not see in the circumstances of this case how the actual payment of the $15,000 to the applicant impacted upon his criminality in offering to sell the decoders to the undercover police officer. We can see no forensic purpose in handing over the money other than to secure evidence of the sale. 
     
      
    20 The Crown pointed out that, because of the way the sentences were structured, the penalty imposed for the offence of selling the 50 decoders was manifestly inadequate and it was only the sentence for the Code offence that allowed the overall sentence to reflect the applicant’s criminality. This is correct, but it was a combination of both the inappropriate use of the Code offence by the Crown, on the one hand, and the way that his Honour structured the sentences, on the other. His Honour failed to understand that the Code offence was not the principal offence despite its higher maximum penalty. The same error was made in Thorn. 
     
      
    21 In our opinion the only way to deal with the Code offence in the absence of any appeal against conviction was to dismiss the offence under s 19B(1)(c) of the Crimes Act. It was in the circumstances of the particular facts of this matter of a trivial nature and we were of the opinion that it was inexpedient to inflict any punishment on the offender. Although this means that the punishment inflicted upon the applicant for the decoder offences is inadequate, that is to a large part the fault of the Crown.

   SENTENCE1 HIS HONOUR: The law in relation to those who supply prohibited drugs is clear: those who traffic to a substantial degree must receive a full-time custodial sentence unless exceptional circumstances can be demonstrated. In this case Mr Johnston, who now appears for the accused, concedes the first of those matters but seeks to persuade me that there are exceptional circumstances which would justify a sentence other than a full-time imprisonment. He suggests one of periodic detention. However, the matters that Mr Johnston relies on are, with one possible exception which I will deal with later, not exceptional at all but common place.2 These offences matters came to the attention of police after witnesses described seeing something suspicious involving a car driven by the accused. There is no suggestion that the accused was involved in earlier criminality, but because of what the police had been told, they went to the Wollongong Central Business District, found the accused’s car and waited. When the accused arrived at his car, he acted suspiciously, police therefore stopped him and told him that they wished to search him. The police told the offender that he should keep his hands where they could see him, but despite that he continued to attempt to reach for his front jeans pockets. The reason that he was doing this was soon made clear, because when they did search the offender, they found two small resealable plastic bags in his front jeans pocket. Each of those bags contained ten tablets. The police asked him what they were and he told them that they were Ecstasy. He was therefore arrested and cautioned.3 The search continued. Police located two further plastic resealable satchels within his front right pocket. There were about ten tablets in each of those. Police then looked in his wallet and discovered $195, the subject of a goods in custody charge. Once more the offender told police the tablets were Ecstasy. Police then decided that they should search the accused’s car. They found an extendable baton (which is now the subject of possess prohibited weapon without a permit charge, which appears on a 166 certificate) and perhaps more importantly they found even more drugs, this time thirty-three tablets in a resealable plastic bag. They also found a different looking tablet. The accused said that the thirty-three tables were Ecstasy but the other one was an anabolic steroid. 4 The accused was then taken back to the police station. He was interviewed and he made admissions, telling police that he supplied the drugs to his friends. After the interview was completed the accused informed police that he had further tablets at his home. He therefore gave them permission to search his home without a warrant. The police then went there and found a further seventy-nine tablets. It is important to realise that those tablets were contained within a locked box. Also in that locked box were a number of other items, most importantly ledgers. When this matter was last before me there was some submission made by the offender’s solicitor that whilst they were ledgers, there was no evidence that they were drug ledgers. However, that issue has fallen away with the offender now conceding that those documents recorded the results of supplies of drugs. 5 It has therefore been conceded that the offender was supplying drugs to a substantial degree. That concession was appropriately made. Although there are some names in the ledgers which appear more than once, it appears that the ledgers related to about nineteen or twenty people, recording drugs supplied and money owing. This was therefore not a simple case of the offender occasionally passing on drugs to his friends. This was a case where the offender supplied substantial numbers of drugs to many other people. Although of course he is only to be sentenced for the offence to which he has pleaded guilty, in determining the extent to which he was trafficking, namely, whether that was a substantial degree or not, it is appropriate to look at things such as the drug ledgers.6 The offender later on told his now girlfriend, Alena White, that at the time he was using drugs it was causing him significant problems, in particular it was causing him to become depressed. That he would continue to supply drugs for money when he himself was experiencing problems with drugs, demonstrates the extent of his criminality.7 The offender has no prior history. He is twenty-three years of age. He comes from a stable and loving family in the Wollongong area. He is, from all evidence, ashamed at the position that he now finds himself in. He told a psychologist, and the author of the pre-sentence report, that during 2008 both his parents’ health deteriorated. His father was diagnosed with cancer and he to this day regularly undergoes tests which cause the offender stress. His mother has also been hospitalised due to mental health issues.8 The offender says in those circumstances he began to both use elicit substances and then supply them. The offender says that he is now remorseful and ashamed at what he has done. It seems that he is fully aware that he has only added to the problems that his parents face. He is now soon to become a father. He and his partner Ms White have bought a home. It of course has a mortgage and they are paying that off. In the event that the offender is sent to gaol arrangements have been made for Ms White’s father to care for the child whilst she returns to work much earlier than she would otherwise in order that the mortgage can be paid.9 Mr Johnston did not suggest that I could take those circumstances into account in any significant way. The law is clear that unless there are exceptional circumstances, hardship to others is not to be taken into account, apart from as part of the general mix of subjective factors. Mr Johnston did not suggest that the circumstances faced by the offender’s partner and the rest of his family were exceptional in any way.10 It is now the case that the offender has rehabilitated himself as much as he can. He is regularly seeing a psychologist. He is ashamed for what he has done and he remains in full-time employment. He is working for a JB Hi Fi store in Wollongong and he is apparently considered management material, although he declines to accept such a promotion because it would involve a loss of income.11 Mr Johnston relies on the circumstance that the offender himself told police about the drugs back in his home after the interview was completed as justifying an “Ellis like” discount. Of course this is not an Ellis situation at all but I will take into account that it is possible, I will not say it is probable, but it is possible that if the offender had not spoken to police about the drugs back in his home, they may not have been discovered. Of course Mr Johnston points out that that would also have meant that the ledgers were not discovered either.12 I take into account the delay that has been occasioned in this matter and that is related to a circumstance that I will eventually get to concerning the history of this matter in the District Court. But it is to be recognised that it has now been sometime since the offender was arrested for this matter and that in the meantime he has committed no further offences and done what he can to rehabilitate himself. He entered a plea at the earliest opportunity in the Local Court which of course has significant utilitarian value, it means that I will impose a sentence upon him which is twenty-five percent less than would otherwise have been the case.13 I now eventually turn to the matter which I said at the outset may possibly justify a finding that there are exceptional circumstances when taken in combination of course with the other matters to which Mr Johnston referred. That matter is this. The appellant first appeared in the Wollongong District Court before his Honour the late Judge Goldring. His Honour, it has to be said without reading all the material before him, formed the view that it was appropriate that the offender be placed on a s 11 remand for three months. The submission from Mr Johnston is that this led his client to understand that if he complied with the conditions of the s 11 remand he would not get a full-time custodial sentence. I am satisfied that that is a fair understanding of what his Honour said. His Honour said to the offender directly,  
     
      
       
      “normally as the Crown Prosecutor has pointed out and as I am sure Mr Miralis has pointed out to you, the normal sentence in this case is full-time gaol. I think there are some circumstances operating in your favour, I am not absolutely certain of them yet but I need to be satisfied on the balance of probabilities of those matters and I am going to give you a chance to show me”.  
      
    14 I think the only fair understanding of those words is that if the offender continued his rehabilitation he would not get a full-time custodial sentence.15 In those circumstances Mr Johnston relies heavily on this as being a matter which takes this case out of the ordinary. There are the favourable subjective features to which I referred and on top of that there is the promise held out to the offender by a District Court judge that he would avoid full-time custody if he continued his rehabilitation as he had been. I have given some anxious considerations to whether that in combination with the favourable subjective features does amount to exceptional circumstances justifying a sentence other than full-time custody.16 On the one hand it is clear that the offender was indeed trafficking to not only a substantial degree but a level even above that. The offender was engaged in very serious criminal activity which to his knowledge was causing harm to those to whom he supplied drugs. This was serious offending and I do have to say that it was a remarkable decision by his Honour to grant the offender the benefit of a s 11 remand without reading all the material tendered before him. However, I am satisfied by Mr Johnston that the circumstances of this case do not require a full-time custodial sentence. The offender was entitled to proceed on the basis that if he did what was required of him, he would not go to gaol full time. Whether that was a wrong decision or not, it was what he was told by a District Court judge. However, as I think I have made clear, a lengthy custodial sentence is nevertheless required. The offender has been found to be suitable for periodic detention and that is the sentence that I will now impose.17 On each of the related s 166 matters I impose a sentence of imprisonment of four months fixed term to be served by way of periodic detention. For the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment for two and a half years. I set a non-parole period of eighteen months, and order that that sentence also be served by way of periodic detention. All of those sentences are to be served concurrently. The offender is to attend the Wollongong Periodic Detention Centre at Unanderra on Saturday 17 April at 8.30am in order to commence serving his sentence.18 I dismiss the backup charge on the 166 certificate.

        “The sentencing process resulted in a miscarriage of justice because the applicant has been left with a justifiable sense of grievance due to the disparity in the sentence imposed upon the applicant and those sentences imposed upon the co-offenders SIU and HUANG.” 
        
       
      
    2 In the course of argument, leave was granted to add an additional ground, namely: 
     
      
       
        
        “Her Honour erred in setting a non-parole period at two-thirds of the head sentence, because it conflicts with her Honour’s assessment of a 60 per cent non-parole period as appropriate.” 
        
       
       
       PART A – THE FACTUAL BACKGROUND 
       
       
      The Offence Charged 
       
      
    3 The Applicant pleaded guilty to a single charge of money laundering under section 400.4(1) Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). So far as relevant, it provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) A person is guilty of an offence if: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) the person deals with money …; and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) either:  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) the person intends that the money … will become an instrument of crime; and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) at the time of the dealing, the value of the money … is $100,000 or more.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    4 The penalty for that offence is imprisonment for 20 years, or 1200 penalty units, or both. Section 4AA Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) fixes the value of a penalty unit at $110. Thus, the maximum monetary penalty is $132,000. 
     
      
       
      Objective Circumstances of the Crime 
       
      
    5 The “dealing with money” to which the charge related involved 27 occasions in the period 26 November 2003 to 11 February 2004 when the Applicant took a sum of cash to a bank and arranged for it to be transferred to a bank account in Hong Kong. On each occasion the amount transferred was, deliberately, less than $10,000. The total amount remitted was $243,952.  
     
      
    6 The manner in which it was contended that the Applicant intended that the money would become an instrument of crime was through breach of section 31 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988 (Cth). Subsection 31(1) provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “A person commits an offence against this section if: 
        
       
       
        
        (a) the person is a party to 2 or more non-reportable cash transactions; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) having regard to: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) the manner and form in which the transactions were conducted, including, without limiting the generality of this, all or any of the following: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (A) the value of the currency involved in each transaction; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (B) the aggregated value of the transactions; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (C) the period of time over which the transactions took place; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (D) the interval of time between any of the transactions; 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (E) the locations at which the transactions took place; and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (ii) any explanation made by the person as to the manner or form in which the transactions were conducted; 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          it would be reasonable to conclude that the person conducted the transactions in that manner or form for the sole or dominant purpose of ensuring, or attempting to ensure, that the currency involved in the transactions was transferred in a manner and form that: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iii) would not give rise to a significant cash transaction; or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (iv) would give rise to exempt cash transactions.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    7 Section 31(2) is in identical terms, save only that para (a) is replaced by: 
     
      
       
        
        “the person conducts 2 or more non-reportable transfers of currency; and” 
        
       
       
      The penalty for each such offence is imprisonment of not more than 5 years.  
       
      
    8 A “significant cash transaction” is defined in section 3 of the Financial Transaction Reports Act as being a “cash transaction involving the transfer of currency of not less than $10,000 in value.”  
     
      
    9 All except 4 of the 27 transactions involved related to an amount of $9,000 or greater, but less than $10,000. The 4 exceptions lay in the range $7,000 to $8,500. 
     
      
    10 On 26 November 2003 the Applicant engaged in three such transactions. He also engaged in three such transactions on 11 February 2004. He engaged in two such transactions on each of 27 and 28 November 2003, and 1, 2, 5 and 19 December 2003. He engaged in four such transactions on each of 9 January 2004 and 3 February 2004. He engaged in a single transaction of this type on each of 17 December 2003 and 2 February 2004.  
     
      
    11 The transactions were carried out at nine different bank branches, of which seven were in the Sydney CBD area, one was at Glebe, and another was at Hurstville. On any day when he carried out more than one transaction, he went to a different bank branch for each of those transactions.  
     
      
    12 For each of the transactions except one, he used a name that was not his own. He used a total of seven different false identities. Concerning some of those transactions in assumed names, he provided false identity documents to the bank officer involved. Concerning the transaction in which he used his own name, he supplied a false address. Concerning each transaction, he placed a signature on a form that made application for the money to be transferred to the Hong Kong account, and gave the incorrect details concerning the transferor. 
     
      
    13 The money was remitted to five different recipients in Hong Kong. Concerning one recipient, it was remitted to three different accounts. Concerning another two recipients, it was remitted to two different accounts. 
     
      
    14 On 19 September 2008, Acting Judge Syme sentenced the Applicant to imprisonment for 3 years and 3 months, with a non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months. 
     
      
    15 The facts put before the judge were not in dispute. They included: (1) the Applicant had been arrested on 13 June 2007; (2) he was in custody from that time until his release on conditional bail on 29 August 2007, 78 days later, and (3) he pleaded guilty at the first available opportunity in the Local Court.  
     
      
    16 I mention here that in this Court it was not in dispute that the facts put before the judge were wrong in one respect. In fact, the Applicant was released on conditional bail on 22 August 2007, and thus had 71 days in gaol between his arrest and release on bail. 
     
      
    17 The activities of the Applicant were part of a much larger money laundering operation that was organised in Australia by a Mr Peter Chen. The judge found that there was no evidence that the Applicant had any knowledge that the money was the proceeds of illegal activity on the part of Mr Chen. The judge also found that the Applicant knew that the activity he himself was carrying out was illegal. 
     
      
    18 The Applicant gave evidence at the time of sentencing that he agreed with Mr Chen that for every $10,000 he remitted he would be paid $80. That would have given him a total fee of $1,920 (if the agreement means that no fee was payable if only part of $10,000 was remitted) or about $1,952 (if the agreement means that he was paid a pro rata fee per dollar remitted). The judge said in her remarks on sentence that the Applicant and Mr Chen agreed that the Applicant would be paid a fee of $80 per deposit made. That works out at a total of $2,160. I do not think that these differences about the amount of his fee are material. At the time the Applicant began the transactions, he was indebted to Mr Chen for $5,000, which the Applicant had borrowed to pay family expenses. The Applicant did not receive any cash in hand for his service to Mr Chen, merely a reduction in the amount of the debt he owed. 
     
      
       
      Subjective Matters 
       
      
    19 The Applicant was born in Indonesia towards the end of 1965. He came to Australia in 1995. He was 43 years old at the time of sentence. He was 37 and 38 years old at the time of offending.  
     
      
    20 The Applicant was working long hours as a cook, and was supporting his wife, his two daughters (one of whom had medical difficulties) and his mother. He was in what the judge found to be a “relatively vulnerable financial position”, and to be “probably an easy mark for somebody like Mr Chen”. There was no suggestion that his vulnerable financial position was the product of drug dependence or gambling. The Applicant and his family were in Australia on a visa that did not provide for any form of social security or other financial support for the family, but did enable him to work.  
     
      
    21 The Applicant offered assistance to the authorities, of a type that the judge regarded as “substantial”. Though the authorities did not need to avail themselves of that assistance, the judge found that he “should be given a full benefit from his willingness”. 
     
      
    22 The Applicant had no prior convictions. The judge found that there was “a good prospect of rehabilitation”. The judge accepted that he had shown remorse and contrition, both in his evidence in court and by his earlier actions in offering assistance. 
     
      
    23 The judge took into account that the likely effect of a sentence on the Applicant’s family was that it would put them into “a very difficult financial position”, and that it was likely that they would have to leave the country. 
     
      
       
      The Sentence 
       
      
    24 The judge accepted that the offence was objectively a serious one. She said that though the Applicant was “a relatively minor player compared to Mr Chen and others in the whole scheme of things”, “money laundering warrants severe punishment, not the least in order to reflect general deterrence to a very significant degree”. 
     
      
    25 Overall, the judge was of the view that the case was in the “mid to lower range of seriousness”. 
     
      
    26 The judge fixed a notional head sentence of 7 years, but discounted that by 25% for the early plea, and by another 25% for his offer of assistance to authorities. That resulted in a head sentence of 3½ years. The sentence that her Honour pronounced, of 3 years and 3 months, was one that commenced from the date her Honour pronounced it. The reduction of 3 months arose largely from her Honour taking into account the time already served in gaol, as she understood it. I will give further consideration to the precise manner in which her Honour arrived at the figure of 3 years and 3 months, and at the non-parole period of 2 years and 2 months, when considering the second ground of appeal later in these reasons. 
     
      
       
      The “Co-Offenders” 
       
      
    27 The two men that the Applicant contends his sentence compares unfavourably with are Siu See-Hon and Huang Bin. Each of them was sentenced after pleading guilty to a money laundering charge, concerning events that bear some similarity to those in which the Applicant was involved. Each had acted at the behest of Peter Chen in repeatedly remitting amounts of cash, each of somewhat less than $10,000, to Hong Kong bank accounts in which Chen was interested. 
     
      
       
      Siu 
       
      
    28 Siu was arrested on 27 April 2005 and later pleaded guilty to a single count of money laundering. That count, like the count to which the Applicant pleaded guilty, alleged a contravention of section 400.4(1) Criminal Code 1995 (Cth). Siu’s offence took place between 6 May 2003 and 14 July 2003 – ie, over a period of nearly 10 weeks. The period of the Applicant’s offending was slightly longer, namely 11 weeks. Siu’s offending involved 59 different deposits, of a total amount of $556,400. Like the Applicant, Siu was paid a commission or fee. In his case, the total fee was about $3,000. 
     
      
    29 Siu had originally been sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years and 11 months, with a direction that he be released at the expiry of 1 year from that sentence upon entering a recognisance to be of good behaviour for 3 years from the date of his release. That sentence was replaced when a Crown appeal succeeded: R v Huang; R v Siu [2007] NSWCCA 259; (2007) 174 A Crim R 370 (“Huang & Siu”). This Court, comprised of Simpson, Howie and Hislop JJ, delivered a joint judgment that related to Crown appeals against the sentences imposed on both Siu and Huang. Those Crown appeals had been argued separately, but this Court dealt with them both in a single judgment. It had been delivered before the Applicant was sentenced.  
     
      
    30 This Court’s judgment concerning Siu and Huang recorded the following matters as ones that the sentencing judge took into account concerning Siu: 
     
      
       
        
        “13 The sentencing judge found the overall enterprise was very sophisticated with large amounts of money being illegally transferred to Hong Kong. [Siu’s] role was not that complex and he was told what to do by the principal. His Honour found that [Siu’s] role in this enterprise was limited and that he was on the edge of the enterprise, although an important component of it, since he was a ‘well-trusted player’ for those who were illegally sending money to banks in Hong Kong.  
        
       
       
        
        14 His Honour had no doubt that [Siu] knew he was involved in illegal activity. Initially he believed the moneys he was depositing were proceeds of an abalone business. However, he left the enterprise before he was charged because in effect he had become aware that the enterprise was likely to involve more than abalone and could be serious and dangerous. His Honour considered that, even if [Siu] believed the funds came from abalone trading, from his earlier involvement in that trade he must have known it was illegal.  
        
       
       
        
        15 His Honour found:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) [Siu] was sixty-four years of age and on a disability pension at the time of the offence. He had been raised in Hong Kong and had moved to Australia in 1982. He was a married man. He had limited English and was in poor health, suffering from a number of medical conditions. He had a prior criminal record for illegal activities in relation to the abalone trade.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) There had been an early plea of guilty, the utilitarian value for which should result in a 25 percent discount. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) [Siu’s] contrition and remorse expressed to various people was limited to his regret that he had been exposed by the police and charged. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) [Siu] had originally given assistance to the police but then had withdrawn his willingness to participate. Later, he again agreed to cooperate. However, his assistance was never availed of due to his lack of credibility and reliability as a witness. His Honour considered there should be some allowance made for his willingness, however variable, to cooperate, but since his assistance was not used, this consideration should be quite limited. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (e) A discount of 35 percent for the plea, expressions of remorse and subjective cooperation was appropriate. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (f) A full time custodial sentence would be much harder for [Siu] than for a healthy young male by reason of his medical conditions. His Honour took that factor into consideration. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (g) [Siu] had no psychiatric, gambling or drug problems and the likelihood of re-offending was ‘somewhat low’. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (h) The offence was committed between May and July 2003, [Siu] was charged in April 2005 and thereafter there were many adjournments, none of the delay being caused by [Siu]. His Honour took into account the delay as a mitigating factor. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (i) There were special circumstances, being [Siu’s] age, health, lack of facility with English, and the fact that his family resided in Victoria. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (j) General deterrence for these particular offences was a very important consideration. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        16 In sentencing [Siu], his Honour took a notional starting point of four and a half years, which he reduced by 35 percent for the discounts previously referred to.  
        
       
       
        
        17 His Honour considered the question of parity between [Siu] and the co-offender, Huang. He concluded there was a considerable difference between [Siu] and Huang, namely that the transaction amount in Huang was over $3,000,000, with the result that the maximum sentence was imprisonment for 25 years rather than 20 years; the offences by Huang were committed over a longer period than those by [Siu]; Huang was more involved in the enterprise and was much younger and his state of health was not compromised, as was [Siu’s].” 
        
       
       
      Huang 
       
      
    31 The charge against Huang was under a different section of the Criminal Code, namely section 400.3(1), to the charge against both the Applicant and Siu. Section 400.3(1) differs from section 400.4(1) in two respects. First, it requires that at the time of the dealing, the value of the money is $1m or more. Second, it provides a penalty of imprisonment for 25 years or 1500 penalty units (which equates to $165,000), or both. 
     
      
    32 The charge against Huang related to activities between 14 January 2003 and 4 November 2003 (nearly 11 months) and involved the making of 335 deposits, comprising a total amount of $3,088,311. Huang was paid a commission or fee per transaction, which totalled about $30,000. 
     
      
    33 Huang was sentenced in the District Court to imprisonment for 3 years, with a direction that he be released at the expiry of 1 year and 9 months upon entering a recognisance to be of good behaviour for a period of 3 years from the date of his release. That sentence, like the sentence given at first instance to Siu, was altered by this Court when a Crown appeal succeeded.  
     
      
    34 This Court recorded the following findings of the judge as relevant to his reasoning process concerning Huang. 
     
      
       
        
        “7 His Honour found  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) [Huang] believed that the money had been acquired through a genuine business venture in Australia and that the sole purpose of forwarding the funds overseas in sums of less than $10,000 was to avoid Australian Taxation. It was accepted by the Crown that the funds were not illegally obtained. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) The offence was objectively very serious having regard to the considerable sum involved, the number of transactions, the period over which it occurred and that it involved considerable planning and organisation though it was not an activity that could be described as sophisticated. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) The principal used [Huang] and others as a runner or courier to present the cash at the bank. His Honour accepted, however, that [Huang] was a ‘very much-trusted employee’ of the principal who was given possession of large sums of money. It is apparent that he did not breach that trust placed in him by the principal. [Huang] played an important role. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) [Huang] had gambled to excess in Australia and that was the cause of his need for funds which led to him being tempted to involve himself in the behaviour for which he was before the court. The offender was in some way in denial as to the extent of his gambling difficulty. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        8 His Honour also found  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) [Huang] was born on 27 October 1967. He was educated to the equivalent of year 12 standard in China and also completed a two-year Diploma in English Studies. He has an excellent command of English. He came to Australia from China in December 1989 and in 1994 was granted permanent residency. In 1996 he became an Australian citizen. He married in 1997 and the marriage ended in divorce. He married a second time and his second wife has returned to China due to her employment commitments. He has a minor criminal record, with fines for two stealing offences and a driving matter. He was also before the Local Court in 1998 for contravention of apprehended violence orders, which related to his first marriage. The funds that were banked by [Huang] were provided by the principal in whose seafood business [Huang] worked. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) [Huang] had provided assistance to investigating authorities which was ‘extremely valuable’ and ‘truly exceptional’. This material included admissions as to many particular transactions which would have been very difficult for the authorities to establish. [Huang’s] current classification in prison was of ‘non association’ and he would be subject to protective custody in the future, which would be burdensome. A discount slightly above 25 percent to reflect his cooperation, both past and future, with the authorities was allowed. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (c) He was satisfied [that Huang] ‘has great contrition’. He allowed 25 percent for the plea of guilty and also a discount for contrition of a month or so. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (d) [Huang] did not require any further personal deterrence though the  
          Criminal Code 
           required significant penalties to be imposed, and general deterrence loomed very much. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        9 His Honour took as his commencing point a sentence of 6½ years which he reduced by 25 percent for the plea of guilty and also a small discount for general contrition. This reduced the sentence to four years and nine months with a non-parole period of three years. He then allowed a discount slightly above 25 percent for cooperation with the authorities, thus reducing the head sentence to three years and he reduced the minimum period to be served to one year and nine months.” 
        
       
      
    35 Both section 400.3(1) and section 400.4(1) contain alternative ways of committing the offence, one involving that “the money … is, and the person believes it to be, proceeds of crime”, and the other involving that “the person intends that the money … will become an instrument of crime”. The charges against each of the Applicant, Huang and Siu involved the second of these alternative ways of committing the offence, not the first. However, in Huang & Siu at [32]-[33] this Court said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the offender’s belief as to the source of the funds will always be a relevant consideration regardless of whether the offender is charged with an offence concerned with the proceeds of crime or an offence concerned with property being used as an instrument of crime. Where it is the latter, the belief as to the source of the funds or its nature is less relevant because the offence is directed at the use to be made of the funds. So the offence of the respondent Siu was aggravated because he believed that the funds were as a result of illegal activity, albeit the activity was not of the utmost seriousness.  
        
       
       
        
        The understanding of the offender as to what was to be the destination of the money or the purposes for which it was to become an instrument of crime is also a relevant consideration. In the present case it was a significantly aggravating factor that the respondent Huang believed that he was actively involved in dealing with the money for the purpose of evading the payment of tax. But as was stated in  
        Ansari  
        [ 
        v The Queen  
        [2007] NSWCCA 204; (2007) 70 NSWLR 89], this is not a matter that is decisive of the seriousness of the particular offence or the appropriate penalty.” 
        
       
      
    36 The Court expressed the view, at [34], that the amount of money involved “is clearly a highly significant matter because the legislation uses it as the principal means of dividing the offences into categories and it is the primary identifier of what is the maximum penalty for an offence.” 
     
      
    37 The Court said, at [35], that the number of transactions, and the period over which they occurred, 
     
      
       
        
        “… are significant because they indicate the extent of the offender’s criminality. Generally speaking a number of transactions involving small amounts of money will be more serious than a single transaction of a larger amount. The latter may be seen as an isolated offence.” 
        
       
      
    38 The Court expressed the view, at [36], that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… in the case of each of the respondents his criminality fell generally within the midrange of offending covered by the relevant sections. Money laundering on the scale in which both respondents were involved should be considered as serious criminal activity that is at the very heart of organised, professional crime syndicates. It warrants severe punishment not the least in order to reflect general deterrence of a very significant degree. When the activity is engaged in for profit, over a significant period of time and with a large number of transactions, the prior good character of the offender is of less significance than might otherwise be the case.” 
        
       
      
    39 The Court held, at [38]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Each of the respondents was well aware of the illegality of his conduct: Huang knew that the funds were to be used for an illegal purpose and Siu knew they were obtained as a result of illegal activity. The respondents were prepared to become involved in serious criminal conduct for profit. They were not isolated acts of offending. …” 
        
       
      
    40 At [39], after noting that Siu dealt with a sum of money that was slightly over half the amount of money that would have taken him into the higher penalty of a section 400.3 offence and over five times the amount of money bringing him within a section 400.4 offence, and that Huang dealt with more than three times the amount that brought him within a section 400.3 offence, the Court continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “… Neither of them was a principal in that they did not own or have an interest in the money with which they dealt. Although that is clearly a matter that reduces the culpability of each, they were both involved in the principal’s illegal conduct to a very substantial degree. Both Judges who dealt with the respondents made findings that they were important and trusted participants in the enterprise.” 
        
       
      
    41 Huang was held, at [42], to be entitled to “little, if any, mitigation” by reason of the offence being a result of gambling. The Court held, at [43], that he was: 
     
      
       
        
        “… more than a mere courier or runner to deliver the money to the bank having regard to his involvement in depositing the money in false accounts. But even if he were limited to that role, in light of the large number of illegal activities and the very significant amount of money involved such a role would not be a matter of very great mitigation.” 
        
       
      
    42 The Court, at [44], regarded the judge’s starting point for Huang of 6½ years as far too low, and that it: 
     
      
       
        
        “… should have been at least 11 years although we believe that a more appropriate starting point was between 12 and 14 years. We have chosen the lowest possible figure because this is a Crown appeal.” 
        
       
      
    43 The Court granted Huang a discount of 50% for the plea and assistance, though regarding that allowance as “a very generous finding notwithstanding that the respondent will spend his time in some form of protective custody.” Huang was re-sentenced to 5½ years, with a non-parole period of 3 years 4 months. Their Honours specifically noted, at [45] that this was “a lenient sentence imposed mainly because of discretionary factors arising from a successful Crown appeal”.  
     
      
    44 In the case of Siu, this Court held (at [46]) that the judge had been mistaken in regarding his conduct as “one of the least serious” examples of conduct that fell within the section. Bearing in mind the amount of money involved, and the fact that there were repeated criminal acts over a period of months, his conduct was said to be: 
     
      
       
        
        “… very substantial criminal activity and warranted a severe, deterrent sentence. The offence was committed for profit, but the amount received by him was of little significance, other than that it disclosed his position in the enterprise. There was limited mitigation in [Siu’s] age and medical condition. His medical problems were largely present at the time of the offending and neither age nor physical illness is a licence to commit crime particularly over a period of three months. The delay in [Siu] being charged was of little significance unless it could be shown to have disadvantaged the offender in some way.” 
        
       
      
    45 The starting sentence that this Court adopted in re-sentencing Siu was said to be “at least 8 years” (at [47]), on the basis that it was a Crown appeal, and notwithstanding that a more appropriate starting point would have been between 9 and 11 years. The same discount, of 35%, that the trial judge had given, was allowed, even though it was said to be “overly generous”. This Court held that the appropriate sentence for Siu (which was the sentence it actually imposed) should have been “at least 5 years”. In so doing, this Court extended some slight extra generosity, not explicitly recognised in the reasons for judgment, to Siu, because allowing a 35% discount on an 8-year sentence would have resulted in a sentence of 62.4 months, or 5 years and 2.4 months. 
     
      
    46 This Court also held that the non-parole period that the judge had imposed on Siu, of about a third of the head sentence, was “manifestly inadequate” (at [48]). The Court substituted a non-parole period of 2½ years.  
     
      
       
       PART B – SUBMISSIONS 
       
       
      Applicant’s Submissions 
       
       
      Co-Offenders 
       
      
    47 The legal principle that the Applicant invokes was stated by the High Court in Lowe v The Queen (1984) 154 CLR 606. It was a case that concerned co-offenders – the lookout man, and the man who had actually taken the money, in an armed robbery. Gibbs CJ at 610 (Wilson J agreeing), Mason J at 611 and 613, and Dawson J at 623 (Wilson J also agreeing), all expressed the same thought, that sentences imposed upon co-offenders should not have such a marked disparity as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance, or give the appearance that justice has not been done.  
     
      
    48 Postiglione v The Queen (1997) 189 CLR 295 likewise involved the sentences of two co-offenders. The co-offenders in question were both parties to the one conspiracy to import drugs. The principle laid down in Lowe v The Queen was reiterated. Dawson and Gaudron JJ said, at 301-2: 
     
      
       
        
        “The parity principle upon which the argument in this Court was mainly based is an aspect of equal justice. Equal justice requires that like should be treated alike but that, if there are relevant differences, due allowance should be made for them: see 
         Lowe v The Queen  
        (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 610-611, per Mason J. In the case of co-offenders, different sentences may reflect different degrees of culpability or their different circumstances. If so, the notion of equal justice is not violated. On some occasions, different sentences may indicate that one or other of them is infected with error:  
        Lowe v The Queen 
         (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 617-618, per Brennan J. Ordinarily, correction of the error will result in there being a due proportion between the sentences and there will then be equal justice. However, the parity principle, as identified and expounded in  
        Lowe v The Queen 
         (1984) 154 CLR 606, recognises that equal justice requires that, as between co-offenders, there should not be a marked disparity which gives rise to ‘a justifiable sense of grievance’:  
        Lowe v The Queen 
         (1984) 154 CLR 606, esp at 610, per Gibbs CJ; at 613, per Mason J; and at 623, per Dawson J. If there is, the sentence in issue should be reduced, notwithstanding that it is otherwise appropriate and within the permissible range of sentencing options.  
        
       
       
        
        Discrepancy or disparity is not simply a question of the imposition of different sentences for the same offence. Rather, it is a question of due proportion between those sentences, that being a matter to be determined having regard to the different circumstances of the co-offenders in question and their different degrees of criminality.” 
        
       
       
      Differences Between the  
      “Co-Offenders” 
       
      
    49 In comparing the sentences imposed upon the Applicant and on Huang and Siu, Mr Wilkinson, counsel for the Applicant, points out that Siu was sentenced to an overall sentence 18 months longer than that imposed on the Applicant and a non-parole period 4 months longer than that imposed on the Applicant. Huang was sentenced to an overall sentence 2 years longer than that imposed on the Applicant and a non-parole period 14 months longer than that imposed on the Applicant. 
     
      
    50 Mr Wilkinson submits that there are significant differences between both the subjective and objective features of the Applicant’s offending, and the offending of each of Siu and Huang. He submits that the objective criminality of the Applicant’s offending was substantially less serious than that of Siu or Huang, bearing in mind the amount of money involved, the number of transactions carried out, and the period over which the transactions were carried out. He points to the following matters in particular:  
     
      
       
        
        “(i) The Co-Offenders were involved in a greater number of structured transactions: HUANG took part in 335 transactions with SIU taking part in 59 transactions, as compared to the applicant’s involvement in 27 transactions. 
        
       
       
        
        (ii) The Co-Offenders were involved in the transfer of substantially more money to offshore foreign banking institutions: HUANG was responsible for the transfer of AUD$3,088,311.00 with SIU transferring a total sum of AUD$556,400, as compared to the applicant’s involvement in the transfer of AUD$243,952. 
        
       
       
        
        (iii) The Co-Offenders[’] period of offending was greater than that of the applicant. HUANG’s period of offending was over 11 months whilst SIU’s involvement was in excess of 2 months. The applicant’s offending spanned a period of 2 months. Although SIU’s period of offending is similar to that of the applicant, SIU carried out more than twice the number of structured transactions during the relevant period. 
        
       
       
        
        (iv) HUANG was paid a commission fee for each transaction which totalled about $30,000.00. SIU was paid a commission fee for each transaction which totalled about $3,000.00. The applicant was paid a commission fee for each transaction which totalled about $2,000.00. 
        
       
       
        
        (v) The Co-Offenders have criminal records. HUANG for acts of dishonesty and a driving matter:  
        R v Huang & Siu  
        [2007] NSWCCA 259 at [8]; 174 A Crim R 370 at 373. SIU for illegal activities in relation to the abalone trade:  
        R v Huang & Siu  
        [2007] NSWCCA 259 at [15]; 174 A Crim R 370 at 375. The applicant has no prior criminal record: ROS at p 7. 
        
       
       
        
        (vi) The role of HUANG was determined as more than a mere courier or runner:  
        R v Huang & Siu  
        [2007] NSWCCA 259 at [43]; 174 A Crim R 370 at 382. 
        
       
       
        
        (vii) There was limited contrition and remorse expressed by SIU:  
        R v Huang & Siu  
        [2007] NSWCCA 259 at [15]; 174 A Crim R 370 at 375. The applicant’s contrition and remorse was manifest and complete: ROS at p 4. 
        
       
       
        
        (viii) SIU gave limited assistance to the authorities having initially withdrawn his co-operation:  
        R v Huang & Siu  
        [2007] NSWCCA 259 at [15]; 174 A Crim R 370 at 375. The applicant’s assistance to authorities was substantial: ROS at p 5. 
        
       
       
        
        (ix) The offence by SIU was aggravated because he believed the source of the funds was the result of illegal activity:  
        R v Huang & Siu  
        [2007] NSWCCA 259 at [32] & [38]; 174 A Crim R at 380 & 381. The applicant was not aware of the illegal nature of the sourced funds: ROS at p 2. This is an important aggravating circumstance of divergence between the applicant’s culpability and that of the co-offender, SIU. 
        
       
       
        
        (x) The Co-Offender’s criminality fell generally within the midrange of offending covered by the relevant sections:  
        R v Huang & Siu  
        [2007] NSWCCA 259 at [36]; 174 A Crim R 370 at 381. The applicant’s criminality fell within the ‘mid to lower’ range of offending and below that of SIU: ROS at p 8-9. 
        
       
       
        
        (xi) The motivation for participation differed. The applicant was motivated by a perceived obligation to repay an outstanding debt to CHEN, who loaned the applicant money so he could pay his daughter’s outstanding school fees. The applicant is a good father and family man. His family was in financial difficulty: ROS at p 2-3. This explains why he became involved in this, his first criminal offence, at his stage of life. HUANG and SIU were motivated by financial gain.” 
        
       
      
    51 Point (iii) is factually incorrect, in that the period of offending of Siu was marginally shorter than that of the Applicant (see para [28] above), but this factual error is not a serious one. 
     
      
       
      The Crown Submissions on Disparity 
       
      
    52 The Crown submits that the ground of appeal originally relied upon as the sole ground should fail for four separate reasons. 
     
      
       
        
        “(1) It is inappropriate to apply the principle of parity in this case as the offenders were not actually co-offenders. 
        
       
       
        
        (2) The different sentences are justified by the different circumstances of the offences/offenders. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) The learned sentencing judge made a finding as to relative seriousness of the respective cases of the Applicant and Siu and this finding is not, and could not be, challenged by the Applicant. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) The degree of difference between the sentences is not so ‘marked’ as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance.” 
        
       
       
       PART C – BETWEEN WHOM DOES THE PARITY PRINCIPLE APPLY? 
       
       
      High Court Authority 
       
      
    53 Considering whether Huang and Siu are actually co-offenders with the Applicant, for the purpose of the parity principle, must start with closer consideration of what previous authority has said about the types of people whose sentences can be compared under the parity principle.  
     
      
       
      Lowe 
       
      
    54 In Lowe the factual situation being considered was that of two people who had co-operated in the one criminal enterprise, though playing different roles in it. 
     
      
    55 Gibbs CJ (with whom Wilson J agreed) said, at 609: 
     
      
       
        
        “The true position in my opinion may be briefly stated as follows. It is obviously desirable that persons  
        who have been parties to the commission of the same offence  
        should, if other things are equal, receive the same sentence, but other things are not always equal, and such matters as the age, background, previous criminal history and general character of the offender, and  
        the part which he or she played in the commission of the offence 
        , have to be taken into account.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    56 Throughout his judgment, Gibbs CJ spoke of the parity principle as one that applied between co-offenders. Mason J at 611 approved the principle that “marked disparity in sentences imposed on co-offenders whose circumstances are comparable is itself a ground for reducing the more severe sentence”. He refers, at 612, to “harshness of the sentence in comparison with that imposed on the co-offender”. At 613 he talked of “the sentencing process as it affected the co-offender”. 
     
      
    57 Wilson J at 616 agreed with both Gibbs CJ and Dawson J.  
     
      
    58 Brennan J took a different view to other members of the Court, in that he did not regard the existence of marked disparity as in itself a ground for altering the sentence of one offender. However, his statement of the relevant principle is likewise expressed in terms of co-offenders. He said, at 617: 
     
      
       
        
        “The imposition of comparable sentences upon co-offenders whose respective conduct and antecedents warrant disparate sentences is unjust. Similarly the imposition of disparate sentences upon co-offenders whose conduct and antecedents are comparable is unjust.” 
        
       
      
    59 Brennan J also said, at 617-18: 
     
      
       
        
        “… an inappropriately lenient sentence imposed on one co-offender is not in itself a ground for interfering with a more severe sentence imposed on another. Of course a marked disparity between the sentences imposed on co-offenders sharpens the interest of an appellate court, not because it establishes appealable error but because there must be an error if the lesser sentence is found to be appropriate and no sufficient ground exists for distinguishing between the co-offenders.” 
        
       
      
    60 Dawson J, at 623, referred repeatedly to co-offenders. He stated a relevant principle as being: 
     
      
       
        
        “… any difference between the sentences imposed upon co-offenders for the same offence ought not be such as to give rise to a justifiable sense of grievance on the part of the offender with the heavier sentence or give the appearance that justice has not been done … This has led to the variation of sentences by courts of appeal in order to reduce the disparity between sentences separately imposed upon co-offenders even where the sentence varied was not in itself excessive.” (citations omitted) 
        
       
      
    61 Thus in Lowe, all the members of the High Court spoke of the principle as one applicable between co-offenders. While not all the judges spelt out who counted as co-offenders for the purpose of the principle, Gibbs CJ (with whom Wilson J agreed) spoke of them at 609 as “persons who have been parties to the commission of the same offence”. Similarly, Dawson J (with whom Wilson J agreed) spoke of them at 623 as being “co-offenders for the same offence”. In Lowe both offenders had committed the “same offence” in both the sense that they were involved in a common criminal enterprise, and also the sense that each had been charged with a contravention of the same provision of the criminal law – notwithstanding their different roles in the enterprise, each was charged with armed robbery. 
     
      
       
      Jones 
       
      
    62 The next time the question of parity came before the High Court was in Jones v The Queen (1993) 67 ALJR 376. The facts of the case emerge somewhat more fully from the judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal (Jones, (NSWCCA, 16 April 1992, unreported)) than from the High Court’s ex tempore judgment. The applicant was charged with supplying an indictable quantity of cannabis leaf on a particular date. She had two people who were described as “co-offenders” in both the Court of Criminal Appeal and in the High Court, without any argument or explanation as to the attribution of that description to them. One was a man who had sent the drug from a country area to Sydney, where it was collected by the applicant and her other co-offender (a woman). The applicant and the female co-offender were to sell the drug in Sydney for a particular price, of which a particular proportion was to go to the male co-offender. The High Court reversed the Court of Criminal Appeal in holding (at 377): 
     
      
       
        
        “It is erroneous to regard the principle of comparability of sentences laid down in  
        Lowe  
        as incapable of application in favour of the first of two or more co-offenders to be sentenced.” 
        
       
      
    63 The brief judgment in the High Court does not purport to be doing anything other than applying Lowe. While the facts do not emerge with complete clarity from the reports, it appears as though the people described as “co-offenders” were all people who played a role in the one act of supply, namely supply of the drug by the applicant to her retail customer.  
     
      
       
      Postiglione 
       
      
    64 In Postiglione v The Queen the principle stated by Dawson and Gaudron JJ, at 301-2, (that I have quoted at para [48] above) was cast in terms of co-offenders. 
     
      
    65 Kirby J was the other member of the majority. He accepted, at 327, that the appellant “feels a grievance about the way in which he has been punished following conviction of his latest offences when compared to the punishment imposed on a co-offender …”. As one reads Kirby J’s statement of “Applicable sentencing principles”, at 335-342, one can be in some doubt about what his Honour regards the “parity principle” as being. At 338 he says: 
     
      
       
        
        “The problem of disparity will ordinarily arise not so much out of a suggested departure from the requirement to punish equally like offenders convicted of like offences ( 
        R v Goldberg 
         [1959] VR 311), as out of the disparate punishment of co-offenders or offenders in a situation demanding comparison and contrast ( 
        R v Beaumont  
        [1955] SASR 110;  
        R v Ball 
         (1951) 35 Cr App R 164). It is in these cases, where discrimination has occurred in the sentences imposed on two or more offenders said not to be justified by the facts either of the offence or of the circumstances of the offender, that the problem of alleged disparity in sentencing presents itself in sharp focus ( 
        R v Tiddy  
        [1969] SASR 575 at 577). It is then that the appellate court must apply the tests which have been propounded and decide whether it should intervene.” 
        
       
      
    66 That passage appears to contemplate that the “problem of disparity” can arise not only in relation to co-offenders, but also where there is “disparate punishment of … offenders in a situation demanding comparison and contrast”. At 340, his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The parity principle, properly applied, will help to avoid the kinds of disparities which occasion the conclusions spoken of in  
        Lowe 
        .” 
        
       
      
    67 That could be read as suggesting that Lowe was merely an example of the “disparities” with which the parity principle was concerned. Similarly, at 341, his Honour spoke of “the parity principle requiring that normally like cases should be treated alike.” That likewise could be read as regarding the parity principle as extending wider than beyond the situation of co-offenders. However, any doubt about whether his Honour may have regarded the parity principle as extending beyond co-offenders is dissipated by his remark at 342 that “essentially, the parity principle remains that stated by this Court in Lowe”. 
     
      
    68 A difference of opinion within the court in Postiglione arose from the fact that the two men who were clearly co-offenders in relation to an offence of conspiracy to import drugs, were both in gaol at the time of commission of that offence and at the time of being sentenced for it. The offences for which they were already in gaol were ones concerning which they were not co-offenders. The problem of principle that lead to the grant of special leave in the case concerned whether the parity principle had any role to play when a court came to apply the totality principle to the sentences of each of the offenders. The majority took the view that in that situation the parity principle could legitimately be used to compare the extra sentence that each offender came to serve in consequence of having committed the second crime, concerning which they were co-conspirators. McHugh and Gummow JJ, in separate judgments, decided, respectively, that any disparity was explained by the application of the totality principle, and that the parity principle had no role to play in that situation. McHugh J said, at 306: 
     
      
       
        
        “… where the totality principle is relevant in the sentencing process and the application of that principle requires different sentences for each offender, no breach of the parity principle occurs.” 
        
       
      
    69 To similar effect, Gummow J expressed his conclusion at 323-4: 
     
      
       
        
        “The appellant bases his case for disparity on a comparison between the amounts by which the respective non-parole periods of [the co-offender] and the appellant were increased following sentence on the federal charges of conspiracy. These non-parole periods depended respectively on the non-parole periods that each offender was already serving for previous offences with which the other offender was not involved. In other words, the appellant submits that the court should apply the parity principle to the total custodial sentence of the two offenders. That total custodial sentence is the product not only of convictions upon conspiracy counts, applying to both offenders, but also convictions of each for prior offences in which the other was not involved. Like is not being compared with like.” 
        
       
      
    70 Of present relevance are the circumstances in which the minority judges saw the parity principle as having a role to play. McHugh J, at 309, adopted a statement of the Court of Criminal Appeal of South Australia in R v Tiddy [1969] SASR 575 at 577: 
     
      
       
        
        “Where other things are equal persons  
        concerned in the same crime 
         should receive the same punishment; and where other things are not equal a due discrimination should be made.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    71 Gummow J, at 322, stated the principle as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Lowe  
        determined that disparity in sentencing of co-offenders may call for intervention by a Court of Criminal Appeal and that the Court may intervene even in cases where the challenged sentence, standing alone, would be regarded as appropriate.” 
        
       
      
    72 Gummow J stated explicitly at 325 “The disparity principle in Lowe only applies to co-offenders”.  
     
      
    73 In accordance with this High Court authority, the parity principle is a principle that must be taken into account in sentencing in addition to other sentencing principles. All the factual circumstances in which their Honours have held that the parity principle applies were ones in which the person whose sentence was being considered on appeal had committed the same crime as another person had committed. The Court held that the sentence imposed can differ from the sentence imposed on the co-offender only if, after taking into account all objective circumstances concerning their respective roles in commission of the crime and all differences in their respective subjective circumstances, there is not such a marked disparity as to give a justifiable sense of grievance, or give the appearance that justice has not been done. If there is a marked disparity of that type, it is in itself a ground for reducing the sentence that is in question, and is not merely symptomatic of some error having occurred in the sentencing process. 
     
      
       
      Intermediate Appellate Court Authority 
       
      
    74 The first of the Crown’s submissions on this appeal is that, as the Applicant did not commit the self-same crime as Huang and Siu, there is no scope for the application of the parity principle. Whether that submission is correct will depend on whether what is meant by “co-offenders” for the purpose of the principle, extends beyond the circumstances of the cases that have come before the High Court, where the co-offenders in question have all committed the self-same crime. As the High Court has not pronounced on that question, it is necessary to turn to intermediate court of appeal authority. While a complete survey of intermediate court of appeal authority on the circumstances in which the parity principle can apply is not practicable, I shall survey enough to ascertain the trend of authority.  
     
      
       
      Sumner 
       
      
    75 Sumner v R (1985) 19 A Crim R 210 is a decision of the Victorian Court of Criminal Appeal. It concerns sentences imposed on men who had handled, at different times, the one consignment of stolen cigarettes. It appears that they were all charged with a contravention of the same provision of the criminal law. Some appealed against sentence “by reason of a disparity between his and that imposed on one or more of his co-offenders” (218). Hampel J, delivering the judgment of the Court, said at 218: 
     
      
       
        
        “The acts performed and the parts played by different offenders to some extent find in one transaction parallels in the other and, of course, each was handling a part of the same goods which were stolen at the time of the armed robbery. It would seem also that the two parcels of stolen cigarettes housed at the Pakenham cool store were not only part of the proceeds of the same robbery, but were also unlawfully ‘handled’ by each of the groups of men convicted under counts one and two respectively at the same level in the distribution process from original theft to the ultimate user.” 
        
       
      
    76 There were significant differences in the roles that different participants had played in the respective handlings, in their criminal histories, in whether or not they had pleaded guilty, and in their subjective circumstances. The judge concluded, at 222: 
     
      
       
        
        “Had any one of the applicants been sentenced as he has been but with there having been no other co-offender to whom punishment was also to be given, we do not think that the sentence so passed could be said to be beyond the range of options open to the judge. But when the sentences of each applicant – or at least some of them – are viewed in the context of the sentences passed upon all other offenders, it appears to us that there is a number of instances of unacceptable disparity.” 
        
       
      
    77 Sumner thus presents an example of the parity principle being used to alter a sentence by reference to the sentence imposed on someone who had not committed the self-same crime, but who was involved in the same criminal enterprise. It is to be noted, though, that as they had all been charged with a contravention of the same provision of the criminal law there was no complication arising from the charges against the men being of crimes of differing degrees of seriousness. 
     
      
       
      Gibson 
       
      
    78 R v Gibson (1991) 56 A Crim R 1 is a decision of this Court on a Crown appeal against sentence. The Respondent had been convicted of possession of a traffickable quantity of cocaine contrary to section 233B Customs Act 1901 (Cth), and of concealing money that may reasonably be suspected of being the proceeds of crime contrary to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 (Cth). The amount of cocaine in his possession was part of a larger quantity that had been brought into Australia. The importer, and various other distributors of the imported goods, all came to be charged and sentenced. Some of the distributors were charged under section 233B Customs Act 1901, while some were charged with supplying a traffickable quantity of cocaine, contrary to section 25 Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The latter Act attracts a “much lower maximum penalty” (p 5) than the former Act. The amounts of cocaine involved in the various charges differed substantially. The subjective circumstances of the various men differed. Some pleaded guilty, some did not. Some provided assistance to the police, some did not. The importer had been sentenced in South Australia by Mohr J, on the basis (different to the principle applicable in New South Wales) that cocaine was a less serious drug than heroin. The judge had sentenced the respondent by taking the sentences that had been imposed on two of the other participants in the criminal enterprise, in relation to which no Crown appeal was then current, “as representing the appropriate scale” (p 5). 
     
      
    79 Carruthers J (with whom Clarke JA and Loveday J agreed) said, at 7: 
     
      
       
        
        “… there is nothing in the various judgments of the High Court in  
        Lowe  
        which requires a sentencing judge in a situation such as that which presented itself to Judge Shadbolt, where the participants in the importation, distribution and possession of this particular cocaine played such diverse roles and were charged with different offences, to undertake a balancing exercise in order to achieve a mathematical equation. There were far too many objective and subjective variables to permit such an exercise to be undertaken.” 
        
       
      
    80 Carruthers J said, at 8: 
     
      
       
        
        “I think that his Honour erred specifically in taking the sentences imposed on Navarro and Colclough as ‘representing the appropriate scale’, to use his Honour's words. I repeat, that there were too many subjective and objective differences between the three cases. Specifically, his Honour appears to have overlooked the fact that Mohr J treated cocaine as a significantly less harmful drug than heroin. Another specific aspect of his Honour's approach, with which I am unable (with respect) to agree, is his attempt to estimate the sentence which Colclough in all probability would have received if he had, like the respondent, pleaded not guilty. An exercise of that nature takes the search for parity to unacceptable limits. Disparity can only arise from a comparison of equals and not a comparison of unequals.” 
        
       
      
    81 The second of the factors on which his Honour relied as showing that the exercise of comparison of sentences was not possible, will often not apply these days, when courts regularly act in the manner urged by R v Thomson & Houlton (2000) 49 NSWLR 383 and quantify the effect of the guilty plea on the sentence. In particular, in the present case, the discounts that each of Huang and Siu received for pleas and other matters were quantified by this Court when re-sentencing them.  
     
      
    82 Relevantly for present purposes, Carruthers J did not say that parity would in principle be inapplicable between the people charged with supplying and those charged with possession, nor that it would be inapplicable between the people charged with supplying as those charges related to different acts of supplying. Rather, the difficulty in taking into account all the differences between the factors that had lead to the differing sentences defeated, at a practical level, any attempt to apply the principle. 
     
      
       
      Howard 
       
      
    83 R v Howard (1992) 29 NSWLR 242 was an appeal by four young men who had participated in the killing of a Mr Johnson. Three of them had been found guilty of murder, while the fourth had been convicted of manslaughter following the trial on a charge of murder. Four other young men had also participated in the killing, and had pleaded guilty to manslaughter. The three men who had been convicted of murder appealed unsuccessfully against that conviction. Their contention was that they should have been convicted only of manslaughter, particularly in light of the fact that the Crown had once been willing to accept a plea of manslaughter from them. This Court (Gleeson CJ, Sheller JA and Lee AJ) noted at 252 that the distinction between the functions of prosecutor (an officer of the executive branch of the government) and court (part of the judicial branch of the government) was “a matter of constitutional importance”.  
     
      
    84 What I take their Honours to there be referring to is this. In Australia, the criminal process is an adversarial one which involves the Crown bringing a case against the accused before a court. It is the executive branch of the government that is responsible for apprehending and charging the accused. But it is the court, exercising judicial power, that convicts and sentences. The nature of judicial power was described by Griffith CJ in Huddart, Parker & Co Pty Ltd v Moorehead (1909) 8 CLR 330 at 357 as: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the power which every sovereign authority must of necessity have to decide controversies between its subjects, or between itself and its subjects, whether the rights relate to life, liberty or property. The exercise of this power does not begin until some tribunal which has power to give a binding and authoritative decision (whether subject to appeal or not) is called upon to take action.” 
        
       
       
      A critical aspect of judicial power is that the court  
      “is called upon”  
      to decide the case. It does not formulate the case itself. 
       
      
    85 In Howard the Court noted, at 253, that it could not reasonably be argued that the evidence against the three appellants who had been convicted of murder did not justify a finding of murder. They said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The unfairness (or, it may be argued, oppression) involved lies in the comparison between the outcome of the processes of criminal justice in relation to those offenders who got in early with pleas of guilty and to those who decided (at their ultimate cost) to take a harder line. The real problem may be, not that the latter were dealt with too severely, but that the former were dealt with two leniently. As was observed in  
        Hui Chi-Ming  
        [ 
        v The Queen 
         [1992] 1 AC 43], unless all co-offenders are dealt with at the one trial, there is always a possibility of differing outcomes in relation to different offenders, and, if this be unfairness, it is not ordinarily regarded as the unfairness of a kind that attracts judicial intervention.” 
        
       
      
    86 An appeal against sentence by all three men convicted of murder likewise failed. Their Honours said, at 254: “Issues of parity are obviously important in this matter.”  Their Honours said, at 258 that at the trial: 
     
      
       
        
        “… a submission was made at his Honour had an overall discretion to do justice to meet the ‘unfairness inherent in the Crown’s conduct’ and it was also put to his Honour that since the abolition of mandatory sentences for murder it was not possible to say that the worst cases of manslaughter call for a lesser sentence than murder. It was put that each applicant’s position was comparable to that of the co-offenders who pleaded guilty to manslaughter and that the principle in  
        Lowe v The Queen  
        (1984) 154 CLR 606 should apply and proportionate sentences be imposed. That submission was not accepted. 
        
       
       
        
        His Honour held, correctly, that he was bound, by reason of the jury’s verdict, to sentence the three appellants convicted of murder on the basis that their conduct was significantly more culpable than that of the co-offenders who was sentenced for manslaughter. They intended to do grievous bodily harm; the co-offenders were sentenced on the basis that they did not. 
        
       
       
        
        When allowance is made for that difference between three of the offenders and the remaining five, and for the discounts given for co-operation with the police, the various sentences that were imposed, when considered both individually and in relation to each other, are appropriate. In the circumstances of this case we see no error in the quantification of the minimum terms and additional terms. We do not consider that, consistently with principle, the Court can intervene in the sentencing process to correct the apparent anomaly that results from the fact that some of the co-offenders were found guilty of murder and others were found guilty of manslaughter. They were all accorded due process of law and, for sentencing purposes, effect must be given by the Court to the outcome of that process.” 
        
       
      
    87 An application for special leave to appeal to the High Court was dismissed, on the basis that “The Court is not persuaded that there was any error on the part of the Court of Criminal Appeal in arriving at its decisions in these matters”: Alex Mihailovic v The Queen (High Court of Australia, 3 February 1994, noted [1994] 1 Leg Rep page C3). 
     
      
    88 R v Howard is authority for the proposition that people who participate in a common criminal enterprise, but are charged with different offences concerning that enterprise, cannot have their sentences compared in a way that seeks to undo or correct for any anomaly that there might appear to be as a consequence of the different charges that the people faced.  
     
      
       
      Ellis 
       
      
    89 Any recounting of the history of the parity principle in this State must make mention of Ellis v The Queen (1993) 68 A Crim R 449. It contains a blazing disagreement between Kirby P and Hunt CJ at CL about the circumstances in which direct comparison is possible between a sentence that is being reviewed on appeal and a sentence imposed on another person for a crime that is not the identical crime but is in some respects similar. However, as the third member of the bench (Studdert J) saw no need to resolve the disagreement, the respective views of Kirby P and Hunt CJ at CL on that topic are all dicta. 
     
      
    90 The case involved an appeal against sentence concerning an offence of armed robbery. The ground on which leave to appeal was sought was severity of the sentence (not parity). While the applicant had had an accomplice in committing the robbery, the identity of that accomplice was never established (at 462). In the course of submissions, counsel for the applicant referred to a decision in Thorley (NSWCCA, 5 February 1991, unreported) that related to an unconnected armed robbery. Studdert J, who wrote the initial judgment, simply said, at 464: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not find that case to be particularly helpful in determining the upper limit in the exercise of the sentencing judge’s discretion. It depended upon its own facts and whilst there were similar features between that case and the present one, there were distinguishing features, one of which was that was that although his companion was armed the applicant in that case was not.” 
        
       
      
    91 Studdert J proposed granting leave to appeal but dismissing the appeal. That passage contains an implicit concession that one function that can be performed by a comparison of a sentence under consideration with another sentence for a different crime is to help (though not be determinative) in determining the upper limit of the sentencing judge’s discretion. Studdert J does not purport, however, to state exhaustively what use can legitimately be made of such a comparison. 
     
      
    92 Kirby P favoured granting the application for leave to appeal, and re-sentencing. He wrote his judgment in two parts, at different times. In the course of considering Thorley, Kirby P said 451: 
     
      
       
        
        “Inherent in the applicant’s submission was the suggestion that there was such a disparity between the sentence in this case and the sentence in  
        Thorley  
        as to involve unequal treatment under the law.  
        
       
       
        
        The High Court of Australia has pointed out that such inequality of treatment, in apparently like cases, is a ‘badge of unfairness’ which erodes public confidence in the integrity of the administration of justice. It is an unfairness which this Court is authorised, and required, to correct: see  
        Lowe 
         (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 611; 12 A Crim R 408 at 410.” 
         
        
       
      
    93 That was the only mention of Lowe or its principles in the first part of Kirby P’s reasons.  
     
      
    94 Kirby P listed 10 points of similarity, and one point of difference, between the respective situations of Mr Ellis and Mr Thorley. He said, at 452:  
     
      
       
        
        “Consideration of  
        Thorley 
        , and what was said by the Court in that case, inclines me to the view that the sentence imposed by Judge Mitchelmore was too severe for the objective facts of this case.” 
        
       
       
      He went on to consider subjective factors. 
       
      
    95 Kirby P said (at 453) that error in the sentence under appeal was shown “by measuring that sentence against the sufficiently similar circumstances of Thorley and like cases”, and another factor. 
     
      
    96 Hunt CJ at CL also wrote his judgment in two parts at different times. In the first part of his judgment he explained why he did not agree with the “approach” of Kirby P. Evidently, that referred to the significant reliance placed on the comparison between the sentence under appeal and that in Thorley. He emphasised the inherently discretionary nature of sentencing. He said, at 460: 
     
      
       
        
        “The sentencing judge is nevertheless required to give full weight to the collective wisdom of other sentencing judges in interpreting and carrying into effect the policy of the legislature; that collective wisdom is manifested in the general pattern of sentences currently being passed in cases which can be recognised judicially as relevant to the case in hand:  
        Oliver 
         (1980) 7 A Crim R 174 at 177, quoted in  
        Visconti  
        [1982] 2 NSWLR 104 at 107.  
        
       
       
        
        It is therefore not to the point to say that, merely because one judge has imposed a sentence which is more severe or more lenient than that imposed by another judge (or even by this Court) in similar circumstances, error has been established in relation to one or the other. What must be looked at is whether the particular sentence which is challenged is outside the general pattern of sentencing by the criminal courts (both at first instance and on appeal).” 
        
       
      
    97 Hunt CJ at CL at 461, said that though Kirby P had said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… he perceived error by measuring the challenged sentence ‘against the sufficiently similar circumstances of  
        Thorley 
          
        and like cases 
        ’, no such like cases were cited at the hearing of the appeal, and I am not aware of any which would alter the limits of the range to which Studdert J referred.” (Original emphasis) 
        
       
      
    98 He want on to say that Lowe was concerned with an appellate court intervening: 
     
      
       
        
        “… where a justifiable sense of grievance had been engendered on the part of one accused where  
        his co-accused 
         has received a lighter sentence than he did, even though the sentence imposed upon the aggrieved accused was itself a perfectly appropriate sentence.” (Original emphasis) 
        
       
      
    99 He continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “The ‘consistency in punishment’ to which Mason J referred (at 610-611; 410) may, of course, be interpreted as being applicable as the ideal to be achieved in sentencing generally, and not just in relation to the sentencing of co-offenders. But his Honour did  
        not 
         suggest that the approach to be taken in relation to the sentences imposed upon co-offenders – when one sentence is compared directly to the other – is similarly appropriate in relation to offenders with similar characteristics who have committed similar crimes. Indeed, he suggests to the contrary (at 612; 411):  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The reference to an appropriate sentence is apt to be misunderstood. Generally speaking, a sentence within a limited range of years is appropriate to the circumstances in which the offence was committed and to the character, antecedents and conditions of the offender. As the ascertainment and imposition of an appropriate sentence involve the exercise of judicial discretion based on an assessment of various factors it is not possible to say that a sentence of a particular duration is the only correct or appropriate penalty to the exclusion of any other penalty.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        What must be looked at is whether the challenged sentence is within the range appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence which merely forms part of that range. There is nothing in  
        Lowe  
        to suggest otherwise.” 
        
       
      
    100 That prompted Kirby P to write the second part of his reasons, in which he identified seven cases “chosen without intense research” that he said concluded (at 459): 
     
      
       
        
        “… suggests that the sentence in this case is so high as to show error. In the name of consistency in punishment – which the community also understands – the Court should reduce the sentence.” 
        
       
      
    101 Of particular relevance for present purposes is that Kirby P said at 459: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        Lowe 
         certainly addresses a different issue of comparison. But just as one can compare (as there) sentences of co-offenders, this Court has the duty to compare sentences of separate offenders in what are said to be analogously similar cases. It does this to guard against the same problem of injustice and to prevent the same badge of unfairness from eroding confidence in the criminal justice system.” 
        
       
      
    102 The upshot is that Hunt CJ at CL and Kirby P agreed that the principle in Lowe concerned the comparison between sentences of co-offenders. Their difference of opinion concerned the legitimacy of comparing directly sentences for crimes that are similar, but not committed by co-offenders. 
     
      
       
      Wurramarbra 
       
      
    103 In Wurramarbra v The Queen (1979) 28 ALR 176; 1 A Crim R 291, the appellant had pleaded guilty in the Supreme Court to burglary and sentenced to 4 years’ imprisonment. The appellant had committed the burglary in question in conjunction with Bara. Bara pleaded guilty to break, enter and steal before a magistrate and was sentenced to 14 months’ imprisonment. An appeal from the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory was heard in the Full Federal Court by St John, Fisher and Gallop JJ. Their Honours said, at ALR 177-8; A Crim R 292-3: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it is perfectly clear that looking at the overall situation, Bara and the appellant were equally culpable. The Crown, however, chose to charge Bara with a lesser offence because of lack of evidence and the question is whether or not the appellant is entitled, within the terms of the principle, to feel a sense of injustice or grievance that gives rise to the application of the rule. It appears to us that the sense of injustice or grievance that the appellant would feel in the instant case would be in the same category as that he would feel if his co-offender escaped detection and was not brought to trial. We are of the opinion that, although the facts may be identical or similar, where there are convictions on different charges, the principle cannot operate. Where, of course, the person convicted of the more serious offence receives a sentence which is less than the person convicted of the less serious offence, all other aspects being approximately equal, different considerations apply. Break, enter and steal is punishable by a maximum of eight years’ imprisonment with hard labour and burglary is punishable by life imprisonment.  
        
       
       
        
        In our view the application of the principle is confined to those cases where there is a true comparison of like with like, where the same offence is proved against both, and the principle is not applicable where there is a great variation in the penalties provided for in the two offences.” 
        
       
       
      Though that case preceded  
      Lowe 
      , the analysis is consistent with it. In particular, it supports the parity principle applying only between people who have committed the same crime. 
       
       
      Watson 
       
      
    104 Watson v The Queen (NSWCCA, 25 February 1992, unreported) was an application for leave to appeal against sentence in which the applicant had pleaded guilty to being an accessory after the fact of stealing a motor vehicle, and sentenced in the District Court. A man called Corrigon had also been involved in the theft of the motor vehicle. Though initially charged with stealing the vehicle, no evidence was offered against him on that charge, and he pleaded guilty to receiving certain parts from the vehicle. He was sentenced in the Local Court, where he received a fine and a bond.  
     
      
    105 Gleeson CJ (with whom Sheller JA and Loveday J agreed) referred to a question of parity between the sentences as one that was “obviously raised”. After referring to Wurramarbra, Gleeson CJ said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… considerations of parity insofar as they are of legal significance are difficult to apply in cases where co-offenders have been dealt with on the basis of the significantly different charges. 
        
       
       
        
        As their Honours pointed out in that case, one co-offender may feel a sense of grievance if another co-offender has escaped detection and has not been brought to trial. That, however, has nothing to do with the kind of sense of grievance that is relevant in relation to considerations of sentencing parity.  
        
       
       
        
        The present applicant might have a sense of grievance about the fact that the police could not prove that Corrigon stole the motor vehicle in question. That is not a relevant sense of grievance for present purposes. In my view, the proceedings taken in relation to Corrigon are so different from those that were taken in relation to the applicant that the argument based on parity is one that should not succeed.” 
        
       
      
    106 That passage seems to accept that parity considerations could be applied between people who had been involved in the one criminal enterprise, though found guilty of different crimes concerning it, but to also recognise that there could be practical difficulties in the application. However, there was no question squarely raised for decision, in the way it is in the present case, about whether parity can apply in circumstances beyond that of two people who commit the one crime.  
     
      
       
      Krakouer 
       
      
    107 Krakouer v R [1999] WASCA 147; (1999) 107 A Crim R 408 is a decision of the Court of Criminal Appeal of Western Australia. The applicant had been convicted of conspiring with one Calder to possess a quantity of methylamphetamine with intent to sell or supply to another, and of an attempt, again with Calder, to possess a quantity of methylamphetamine with intent to sell or supply to another. Though it does not appear from the report, the respective maximum sentences of imprisonment for those crimes at the time were 20 years, and 12½ years respectively (sections 33 and 34 Misuse of Drugs Act 1981 (WA)). One of the grounds of his application for leave to appeal against sentence was that he had a justifiable sense of grievance as a result of the sentence imposed on a John Higgs by the County Court of Victoria. Higgs was the mastermind of the organisation from which the applicant and Calder had obtained their methylamphetamine. Higgs was sentenced for an offence under the Victorian legislation, namely conspiring to traffic (by manufacture) in a drug of dependence. The maximum penalty for that offence was 15 years imprisonment. Higgs was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment, with a minimum of 4 years before being eligible for parole. By comparison, the applicant was sentenced to 16 years.  
     
      
    108 White J, (with whom Ipp and Heenan JJ agreed) ruled that the parity principle was not applicable because, at [15]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Foster and Higgs were sentenced for different offences, being contraventions of a different Act. Accordingly, they were not sentenced as co-offenders with the applicant, or for an offence of the kind in respect of which the applicant was sentenced.” 
        
       
       
      Kerr 
       
      
    109 R v Kerr [2003] NSWCCA 234 (unreported) concerned the sentencing of participants in a single criminal enterprise, who had different roles in that enterprise and were charged with different offences. The criminal enterprise involved was a robbery. The applicant was convicted of robbery in circumstances of aggravation, namely using corporal violence and maliciously inflicting actual bodily harm. One of his accomplices was charged with robbery, but with no circumstances of aggravation. The other accomplice, who had driven the car, had been charged with concealing a serious indictable offence. The applicant had been sentenced to 13½ years’ imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 10½ years. The accomplice charged with concealing a serious indictable offence, Oliver, was given an 18 month suspended sentence. The accomplices had been sentenced before the applicant was sentenced, but the judge who sentenced the applicant took the view that no issue of parity arose. 
     
      
    110 On the appeal Miles AJ (with whom Beazley JA and Adams J agreed) said, at [13]-[15]: 
     
      
       
        
        “However the principle of parity in sentencing, or rather the policy behind it, was not so easily dismissed, in my view. The policy behind the principle is not to be avoided by the prosecuting authority simply charging co-operative offenders with less serious offences. The whole of the circumstances need to be examined.  
        
       
       
        
        Clearly neither of the other two was treated as a co-offender but at the same time each was implicated in the events which gave rise to the aggravated robbery.  
        
       
       
        
        There are two aspects to the principle. Like has to be and may only be compared with like and any imbalance must be enough to justify on objective analysis a sense of grievance on the part of the offender who complains of the heavier sentence:  
        Postiglione v The Queen 
         (1997) 189 CLR 295. As to the first aspect, the principle is difficult to apply in the present case since neither of the two co-offenders was charged with the offence of aggravated robbery. ...” 
        
       
      
    111 He noted, at [15], that the fact that one of the accomplices had been charged with robbery, with no mention of aggravation “appears explicable on the basis of his co-operation with the authorities rather than his actual participation in the events.”  
     
      
    112 Miles AJ said, at [19]-[20]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… It is also recognised that the parity principle is of wide application and is not to be applied or withheld in a technical or pedantic way. It is indeed part of or a reflection of the wider principle that consistency in sentencing by the courts overall is to be aimed at as desirable in the public interest. Perfect consistency is a goal that can never be reached because of the infinite variety of the circumstances of offences and offenders. However there is a danger that it may be compromised by the selection of differing charges so that one offender may be charged with a serious offence and given punishment at the top of an acceptable range for that offence, and a co-offender charged with another less serious offence and dealt with at the very bottom of the acceptable range for that other offence. There may be no impropriety in that course, which will often arise from negotiation between co-offenders and law enforcement authorities. Sometimes, however, and it is not necessary to put it higher than that, the result may have the appearance of injustice.  
        
       
       
        
        In other words when it is known that a person implicated in the offence for which an offender is being sentenced has already been convicted and sentenced, care needs to be taken to ensure that as far as possible the sentence about to be imposed is not so severe as to generate, not only a sense of grievance in the offender but also a sense of disquiet in the disinterested observer. …” 
        
       
      
    113 It was the comparison between the applicant’s sentence and that of Oliver on which the appeal turned. Miles AJ concluded, at [26]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… it was necessary to give proper consideration to the way in which Oliver had been charged and dealt with and it was not enough to say that no issue of parity arose. Had the appellant been represented it is almost certain that the sentencing judge would have been asked to give consideration to that factor. Had consideration been given, it is likely that the sentence imposed would not have been so far towards the top of the range. Furthermore it must be concluded that whilst Oliver had to be sentenced for the less serious offence under s 94, he received a very lenient sentence on any view, and so lenient that it should have alerted the judge sentencing the applicant to the need to avoid a sentence of gross disproportion. That also is a factor which should have been taken into account on the sentencing of the appellant and was not. In my view these matters are sufficient for this Court’s jurisdiction to be enlivened and for the Court to proceed to sentence on the material now available.” 
        
       
      
    114 Upon a re-sentence, the applicant’s sentence was reduced to 9 years and 8 months, with a non-parole period of 7 years and 3 months.  
     
      
    115 The Applicant placed reliance upon Kerr, and in particular the statement that “it is also recognised that the parity principle is of wide application and is not to be applied or withheld in a technical or pedantic way.” I note that no authority was cited in Kerr in which that proposition was “recognised”.  
     
      
    116 Kerr supports the application of the “parity principle” as a basis for reduction of a sentence if it is disproportionate to the sentence imposed on a person with whom the applicant has been engaged in a common criminal enterprise, but who has been charged with contravention of different provisions of the criminal law, and in that sense has not committed the same crime as the applicant.  
     
      
    117 However, in my view there is a serious problem for the persuasiveness of Kerr in that it did not consider the decision in Howard. The statement of Miles AJ at [13] (para [110] above) is in my view directly inconsistent with Howard. The constitutional significance of the difference between the function of the prosecutor and the court, provides a reason, that in my respectful view is sound in principle, for the parity principle not being able to correct for apparent differences in sentence that arise from offenders involved in a common criminal enterprise being charged with different offences.  
     
      
    118 As well, this aspect of Kerr has been poorly received in later cases in this Court. I will return to Kerr after discussing the next case in the chronological order. 
     
      
       
      Formosa 
       
      
    119 In R v Formosa [2005] NSWCCA 363, the applicant, together with Mr Colin Wood and another man, went at night to premises occupied by Wood’s sister and her boyfriend, a Mr Parry. Parry opened the door to Wood, whom he knew, and Wood went to see his sister elsewhere in the premises. The applicant and the other unknown man then attacked Parry very seriously. The applicant had previously lived with Wood’s sister, and resented her new relationship with Parry. The applicant pleaded guilty to maliciously inflicting grievous bodily harm whilst in company, and was sentenced to 4 years’ imprisonment with a non-parole period of 18 months. Wood pleaded guilty to a charge of being an accessory after the fact. He was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months. That 6 months was a sentence that was cumulative on other sentences he was serving for some drug offences. Simpson J (with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hoeben J agreed) expressed the view, at [11], that the facts put before the judge who had sentenced Wood would have supported a much more serious charge. One of the grounds of the applicant’s appeal was lack of parity between the applicant’s sentence and that of Wood. The applicant submitted (at [31]) that “The policy behind the principle of parity is not rendered otiose by the co-offender being sentenced to a lesser charge on election by the prosecuting authority to accept a plea to a lesser offence.” Simpson J gave detailed consideration to Kerr, and noted that in both Lowe and Postiglione the co-offenders whose sentences were in question had been charged with identical offences as that of the appellant. Her Honour said, at [39]-[40]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Nothing the High Court said was directed towards the application of the parity principle in cases where offenders were charged with different offences carrying different maximum penalties.  
        
       
       
        
        The decision in  
        Kerr 
          
        is capable of being read as extending the principle so that it applies even where co-offenders are charged with different offences. I do not wish to be taken as entirely rejecting the proposition that the principle can be so applied, but here, with the extremely wide divergence between the nature of the crimes charged against the co-offender and against the applicant it is difficult, if not impossible, to see how that principle can be applied.  
        
       
       
        
        The effect of the submissions made on behalf of the applicant (and the decision in  
        Kerr 
         is at least capable of giving them some support) is that the principle of parity in sentencing is broad enough to extend to redressing disparities or discrepancies in the charging process as well as in the sentencing process.” 
        
       
      
    120 She concluded at [44]: 
     
      
       
        
        “I do not understand either  
        Lowe 
         or  
        Postiglione 
         to suggest that the parity principle extends to correcting any imbalance in the manner in which co-offenders are charged. I would be very cautious before proposing or adopting any such principle.” 
        
       
      
    121 Her Honour ultimately decided, at [52], that “the principles of parity not only do not require, they would not permit, this Court to intervene as suggested on behalf of the applicant”. There were two separate categories of reason for reaching that conclusion. The first, at [50], related to the way in which the decision of the prosecuting authorities was a substantial part of the reason for the difference between the two sentences: 
     
      
       
        
        “Here, the main reason for the discrepancy in sentences on the two co-offenders derives from the difference in the charges they faced. The applicant may have a sense of grievance, even a legitimate one, about that difference; but it is not a legitimate sense of grievance in the  
        Lowe 
         or  
        Postiglione 
          
        sense, concerning the sentences imposed; it is a sense of grievance engendered by the prosecutorial decision making process. That is not something over which this court has supervisory jurisdiction, even by the backdoor method of supervising sentencing.” 
        
       
      
    122 The second, at [51], was a collection of reasons relating to differences between the situations of the applicant and Wood that bore upon their respective sentences: 
     
      
       
        
        “… No finding was made that either of the offenders was the instigator of the offence, although there are hints that it might have been Colin Wood. Certainly it was the applicant’s grievance about the end of his relationship with Belinda Wood that was the precipitant for the offence. It is true, also, that Colin Wood had a relevant criminal record, which the applicant did not. This would ordinarily give rise to a more severe, rather than less severe, sentence. However, Colin Wood had also been sentenced on additional and different charges and the sentence imposed had to have regard to the principle of totality.” 
        
       
      
    123 While her Honour did not reject in principle the application of parity principles to a situation where two participants in a common criminal enterprise play different roles and are charged with different offences, the case provides no support for the parity principle having any role to play concerning the sentencing of people who are not part of a common criminal enterprise. I suspect that the reason for her Honour’s caution is that the Court in Formosa was not referred to the decision in Howard, which provides a reason of principle why the parity principle cannot correct for anomalies arising from participants in a common criminal enterprise being charged with different offences. 
     
      
       
      Returning to  
      Kerr 
       
      
    124 There are other reasons that are related to the constitutional difference between courts and prosecutors that Gleeson CJ drew attention to, that also lead to the conclusion that courts are not in a position to correct for differences in the charges that are brought against people involved in a common criminal enterprise. At a level of broad policy, the law in sentencing aims to treat like cases alike, and unlike cases differently. But the policy underlying the law is not the same as the law itself. There are practical difficulties in carrying that policy into effect. One of no small significance is that sometimes there will be occasions when an offender is charged with a lesser crime than would have been justified if all the relevant facts had been discovered by the police, or than would have been justified if the police had admissible evidence, rather than information that does not meet the standards of admissibility. There is always, in one sense, unfairness if one person receives a heavier sentence than a person who if all the facts were known could be seen to be equally culpable but against whom the truth of what actually occurred cannot be proved by admissible evidence. A sentencing judge will usually not be in a position to know whether the reason for one person involved in a criminal enterprise being charged with a lesser offence than another is lack of evidence, rather than that the facts if fully known justified the difference in the charges. This is one particular consequence of courts acting only on the basis of admissible evidence or conceded facts. 
     
      
    125 There are other limitations on a judge being able to compare directly the sentences of people charged with different offences. There will be occasions when one person involved in a criminal enterprise is charged with a lesser offence than another in what might be called a comparatively clear exercise of prosecutor’s discretion. Such an occasion arises when, even though on the available admissible evidence it would have been open to charge the first of those people with a more serious offence than was actually charged, the prosecutor decided not to do so, perhaps as part of a plea bargain, perhaps as a trade-off for the person charged providing assistance, perhaps because of matters personal to that person like youth, perhaps for other reasons. There will be other occasions when one person involved in the criminal enterprise is charged with a lesser offence than another in circumstances where the available admissible evidence is such that even the most assiduous prosecutor could not realistically have expected to prove a more serious offence against the first of those people. There will be other occasions that have some elements of both of these factual scenarios. It will often be impossible for a judge to know whether the charging of two people with different offences is truly, or wholly, a matter of discretion on the part of the prosecutor. In comparing the sentences of co-offenders courts are well able to factor out the effect on the sentences of differences that the court knows about in the objective circumstances of involvement of the respective co-offenders in the crime, and in the subjective circumstances of the offenders. But it would not be practicable for a court to try to apply an extended version of the parity principle by comparing the sentences of two people involved in the common enterprise and factoring out the extent to which the difference in the sentences is a function of prosecutorial discretion. It cannot carry out that task when it does not know to what extent it is truly a discretion, rather than something else, that is the reason for the difference in the charges. In the result, to the extent to which differences in sentence arise from differences in the charges brought against two people involved in the one common criminal enterprise, those differences cannot be corrected for by an application of the parity principle. 
     
      
    126 The Court of Criminal Appeal does not regard itself as bound by its own earlier decisions: R v Johns [1978] 2 NSWLR 259 at 260-2 per Street CJ, with whom Nagle, Begg, Slattery and Sheppard JJ (at 264), Lee J (at 270) and Lusher J agreed; R v Mai (1992) 26 NSWLR 371 at 380-1 per Hunt CJ at CL (with whom Enderby and Allen JJ agreed); R v Arnold (1993) 30 NSWLR 73 at 77 per Hunt CJ at CL, 85 per Abadee J (with whom Gleeson CJ agreed); R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 214 per Spigelman CJ (with whom Wood CJ at CL, Sully, BM James and Adams JJ relevantly agreed). However, as is made clear in R v Mai at 380, and also in R v Arnold at 74-75, 85, the power of departing from its previous decisions is exercised with caution and a due regard for the orderly administration of the law. As well, these days, it would be anomalous if this Court were to be restrained by Australian Securities Commission v Marlborough Gold Mines Ltd (1993) 177 CLR 485 at 492 or by Farah Constructions Pty Ltd v Say-Dee Pty Ltd [2007] HCA 22; (2007) 230 CLR 89 at 151-2 [135] from departing from a decision of another intermediate Court of Appeal if in comparable circumstances it were free to depart from a previous decision of its own.  
     
      
    127 Consistently with Marlborough Gold Mines and Farah v Say-Dee, departure from a previous decision would require a strong conviction that the previous decision was incorrect: Gett v Tabet [2009] NSWCA 76; (2009) 254 ALR 504 at [284]. As well, however, John v Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1989) 166 CLR 417 at 438-9, followed in Gett at [297], listed some practical considerations (drawn from the judgment of Gibbs CJ in Commonwealth v Hospital Contribution Fund (1982) 150 CLR 49 at 56-8) that favoured reconsidering an earlier decision: 
     
      
       
        
        “The first was that the earlier decisions did not rest upon a principle carefully worked out in a significant succession of cases. The second was a difference between the reasons of the justices constituting the majority in one of the earlier decisions. The third was that the earlier decisions had achieved no useful result but on the contrary had led to considerable inconvenience. The fourth was that the earlier decisions had not been independently acted on in a manner which militated against reconsideration…” 
        
       
      
    128 In Queensland v The Commonwealth (1977) 139 CLR 585 at 630 (relied on in Gett at [298]) Aickin J set out some other factors relevant to overruling a prior decision: 
     
      
       
        
        “The first is that there should be no inhibitions about overruling a decision, the error of which has been made manifest by later cases which however have not directly overruled it. The second is that the Court will be slow to overrule, or should refuse to overrule, cases which ‘go with a definite stream of authority’ and do not ‘conflict with well established principle’. The third is whether the prior decision can be confined as an authority to the precise question which it decided or whether its consequences would extend beyond that question. The fourth is whether the prior decision is isolated ‘as receiving no support from prior decisions and as forming no part of what in one metaphor is called a stream of authority and in another a catena of cases.’”  
        
       
      
    129 Though those practical considerations were stated as ones that the High Court applied to reconsideration of its own decisions, and there are some clear differences between the respective roles of the High Court and an intermediate appellate court, nonetheless they can provide some guidance to when it is appropriate for an intermediate appellate court to refuse to follow one of its own decisions: Gett at [301].  
     
      
    130 I am persuaded, for the reasons I have given, that Kerr was mistaken in extending the parity principle to apply to undo the extent to which differences in the sentences of people involved in a common criminal enterprise, but who are charged with different offences, arose from the charges being different. Kerr did not rest upon any principle carefully worked out in a series of cases – indeed it ignored the earlier and contrary decision in Howard. While there was no disagreement between the judges who decided Kerr, it has not been relied on in a series of cases thereafter. Rather, it has been the subject of repeated criticism that has not gone quite as far as actually deciding it is wrong. I would not follow the aspect of it that permitted the parity principle to undo the effect on sentence of different charges being brought against two participants in a common criminal enterprise.  
     
      
       
      Araya 
       
      
    131 R v Araya [2005] NSWCCA 283; (2005) 155 A Crim R 555 was an application for leave to appeal against a sentence concerning five counts of obtaining a valuable thing by deception and one count of attempting to obtain a valuable thing by deception. Each of the charges related to obtaining (or attempting to obtain) an airline ticket after purportedly paying for it by charging it to a non-existent credit card. One of the grounds of appeal concerned what was said to be a lack of parity with a sentence imposed upon a Mr Chandra, who was said in a ground of appeal to be a “co-accused”. Mr Chandra lived at the same accommodation as the applicant (at [75]). He had pleaded guilty to four counts of obtaining a financial advantage by deception. Three of those charges related to obtaining air tickets by provision of false credit card information, while the fourth related to a purchase of air conditioners by provision of false credit card details. Though Chandra asserted that the purchase of the air conditioners was being carried out on behalf of the applicant, the applicant was not charged with any offence relating to air conditioners. One of the air tickets that the applicant had obtained by deception was issued in the name of a Mr J Chandra, but the applicant was not charged concerning that ticket. The argument placed before the Court was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “65 … Senior Counsel for the Applicant accepts that Mr Chandra and the Applicant were not co-offenders and that the normal parity principle does not strictly apply. However, he contends that there are similarities between the criminal conduct of the two offenders, their related arrests and parallel criminal proceedings in such a way as to attract, by analogy, the parity principle. It is submitted that the Applicant has been left with a sense of grievance which, in all the circumstances, is justifiable.” 
        
       
      
    132 Johnson J (with whom Simpson and Rothman JJ agreed) explained (at [66]-[72]) why the parity principle did not apply, in terms upon which I cannot improve: 
     
      
       
        
        “66 As the Applicant and Mr Chandra were not co-offenders, the parity principle reflected in  
        Lowe v The Queen 
          
        (1984) 154 CLR 606 and  
        Jones v The Queen 
          
        (1993) 67 ALJR 376 has no application.  
        
       
       
        
        67 This Court has held that the parity principle is not to be applied when a ground of appeal invites comparison between sentences imposed upon two offenders, who are not co-offenders, simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. In  
        R v Morgan 
          
        (1993) 70 A Crim R 368 at 371, Hunt CJ at CL (Allen J and Loveday AJ agreeing) said:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘It is quite wrong to compare the sentence under challenge directly with that imposed upon another offender (who is not a co-offender) simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes. What must be looked at is whether the challenged sentence is within the range appropriate to the objective gravity of the particular offence and to the subjective circumstances of the particular offender, and not whether it is more severe or more lenient than some other sentence (other than that of a co-offender) which merely forms part of that range.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        68 In  
        R v F 
          
        (2002) 132 A Crim R 308, it was submitted on behalf of an offender that the Court should treat the sentence imposed in a different case upon a different offender as being a  
        ‘benchmark’ 
         which ought be followed. The Court rejected this argument. Simpson J said at 315:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘Consistency in sentencing may be achieved by the slavish adoption, by a subsequent court, of a sentence selected by an earlier court when the facts are comparable. However, that would be consistency purchased at the cost of the sacrifice of the proper exercise of judicial discretion. Within the bounds of the appropriate range of sentences, each sentencing judge (either at first instance or following appeal) must bring to bear his or her own independent assessment of the particular case.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          I do not find the argument in relation to the desirability of consistency in sentencing persuasive in this case. Consistency is not derived from a single case. Consistency in sentencing will be achieved from a range of cases involving similar features, and also variables. It depends upon the accumulated wisdom and experience of sentencing judges. In my opinion a single case is inadequate to enable a principled consistent approach. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          … 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Moreover, while consistency in sentencing is, no doubt, an important goal, equally important for the administration of justice is the public perception that sentences imposed by criminal courts are appropriate to the nature and seriousness of the crime committed.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        Meagher JA at 309-310 agreed with Simpson J, but preferred to use the words  
        ‘more important’ 
         rather than  
        ‘equally important’ 
         in the last quoted passage. Howie J expressed a similar view to Meagher JA in this respect at 316-317. 
        
       
       
        
        69 In  
        R v George 
          
        (2004) 149 A Crim R 38 at 47, the Court (Wood CJ at CL, Adams and Kirby JJ) approached a ground of appeal which invited comparison with sentences in other case[s] in the following way:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘We are unable to gain any meaningful assistance from a reference to these cases. It is necessary to restate that the practice, which appears to have developed in recent times, of approaching sentence appeals by a search for, and comparison with, sentences passed in other cases, is neither helpful nor justified by authority: see  
          R v Morgan 
           (1993) 70 A Crim R 368;  
          R v Salameh 
           NSWCCA 9 June 1994 and  
          R v Trevenna  
          (2004) 149 A Crim R 505 at [98] to [101] per Barr J. At the most, other cases can do no more than become part of a range for sentencing, which in the case of manslaughter is wider than for any other offence.  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          The difference in objective and subjective culpability, which is found in these decisions, is such that any search for a correlation between the case at hand and another decided case is to ignore the judicial discretion which is involved in the individual sentencing exercise required. As Barr J said in  
          Trevenna 
          , ‘Even if it were possible to say that the culpability in two unrelated cases was the same it would not be correct to say, if the sentences were different, that for that reason alone one of them must be wrong.’ Inter alia any such approach would have to assume that the other was correct, and that is an assumption which cannot logically be made.” 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        70 Similar sentiments have been expressed by this Court when arguments have been advanced on appeal comparing sentences imposed for offences of dishonesty or fraud committed by persons who are not co-offenders:  
        R v Hawker 
          
        [2001] NSWCCA 148 at [17]-[18];  
        R v Swadling 
          
        [2004] NSWCCA 421 at [29], [54];  
        R v Martin 
          
        [2005] NSWCCA 190 at [56]. In each of those cases, the Court has emphasised that far greater assistance is derived from references to general sentencing policy.  
        
       
       
        
        71 In  
        R v Singh 
          
        [2001] NSWCCA 424, an argument was advanced that an unjustified disparity existed between the overall sentence imposed upon the Applicant when compared with others who might be considered to be his co-offenders. It was submitted for the Applicant that he was one of a group of offenders, most of whom had been dealt with by different District Court Judges, in respect of the sale of amphetamines from a particular café in Kings Cross. In the course of rejecting this argument, Howie J (Grove J agreeing) said at [12]:  
        
       
       
        
         
          
          ‘The applicant was never charged with any offence in relation to the supply of drugs to, or by, the persons at the café. The applicant was not a co-offender of any person other than the unidentified person or persons who supplied him with the drugs that he on-supplied to the operative. The supply to the undercover officer was only in the most indirect way connected to the criminal conduct emanating from the café and for which other persons were sentenced. As Judge Woods noted, the applicant was not the target of the police operation and, in his Honour’s words, he ‘simply became roped in’. Regardless of what sentences the persons connected with the drug dealing from the café received, the applicant could not have a justifiable sense of grievance about them. The sentences of those persons are no more relevant than would be the sentences imposed upon other associates of the applicant for unrelated drug offences. Although Judge Woods said that he would bear in mind the sentence imposed upon one of the barmen at the café for supplying ecstasy, I cannot understand why he did so.’ 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        72 It was accepted in this case that the Applicant and Mr Chandra were not co-offenders. Whatever may have been the position with the offences contained in the original indictment, it is the case that none of the offences to which the two offenders ultimately pleaded guilty were committed by them as co-offenders. As will be seen, it appears that there was some association between the two offenders and some overlap in their activities. However, I do not consider that this attracts the parity principle to the Applicant’s case. In my view, the correct approach to the present argument involves application of the principles referred to in  
        Morgan 
        ,  
        F 
        ,  
        George 
          
        and  
        Singh 
          
        referred to above.” 
        
       
      
    133 His Honour concluded, at [85]-[86]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The parity principle has no direct application to this case. It is true that the two offenders are not unrelated. This is not a case such as  
        Morgan 
        ,  
        F 
          
        and  
        George 
          
        where the Court is asked to compare sentences for entirely unrelated offenders and offences. This case is closer to  
        Singh 
         where a parity-type argument was rejected.  
        
       
       
        
        The applicable principles, however, are those contained in  
        Morgan 
        ,  
        F 
        , 
          
        George 
         and  
        Singh 
        . The issue is whether the sentences imposed upon the Applicant are outside the appropriate range of sentence for offences of this type. A comparison of the Applicant’s case with the sentences imposed upon Mr Chandra does not demonstrate error in this respect.” 
        
       
      
    134 His Honour then went on to consider what would happen “if the parity principle is considered by analogy”. He rejected that there would be any legitimate sense of grievance arising from a comparison between the two sentences, each considered in their appropriate context of circumstances. 
     
      
    135 This was not, as I understand it, a recognition that an extended version of the parity principle might apply in the case before him. 
     
      
    136 There is clear High Court authority that the principle applies to the sentences imposed upon co-offenders, in the sense of people who have both committed the one crime. As cases discussed both above and below show, there is a stream of authority in intermediate courts of appeal recognising that, within limits, it can have a role to play in comparison of sentences for different crimes committed by people involved in a common criminal enterprise. Outside its proper scope of application it cannot apply at all. In accordance with the principles that Johnson J quoted from Morgan, R v F, George and Singh the sentencing of people who have not committed crimes to which the parity principle can be applied must be carried out by direct application of the principles of sentencing.  
     
      
    137 It can be legitimate for a sentencing judge to look at sentences imposed in other cases as part of the sentencing judge’s own reasoning towards a sentence by direct application of those principles. But three things need to be borne in mind in so doing. The first is that the judge’s aim in so doing is not to achieve a fair comparison with any particular sentence, but to understand the range within which other judges have sentenced for somewhat similar crimes. The second is that it may be that some previous sentencing decision is itself, even if not wrong to an extent that would be corrected on appeal, still not a particularly good example of the application of sentencing principles, and thus would provide an unreliable guide. The third is that the “range” is not a reference to the range of sentences that are applied in fact – it is a reference to the range of sentences that are open to a judge in the proper exercise of a sentencing discretion.  
     
      
    138 The range of sentences that have been applied in fact is relevant in two different ways to the range of sentences open in proper exercise of the discretion. The first is as a way of educating or reminding the judge, by illustration or ostensive definition, of the range. In that way it provides some indication of the range of sentences open in proper exercise of the discretion, but is not determinative of it. That is shown by the way in which a guideline judgment could have the effect that the sentences that courts have in fact been applying are shown to have been, in general, too high, or too low to be the result of proper application of the sentencing principles.  
     
      
    139 The second is that the aim of achieving equality of treatment across the range of sentences, so far as is possible, is advanced if the sentence that a judge imposes in a particular case is not, without good reason, out of keeping with the sentences that have actually been imposed across the range for similar crimes. That one is writing a guideline judgment could be such a good reason. When the “range” consists of crimes that have considerable differences in both objective facts and subjective circumstances from the crime that is being sentenced for, this comparison with the “range” is done at a fairly impressionistic level, not by being guided by a close comparison of the facts of an individual crime that has already been sentenced for with the facts of the crime that the judge is in the process of deciding a sentence for. That the comparison is done in a fairly impressionistic way is a reason why the comparison is subordinated to the direct application of the sentencing principles in arriving at a sentence. The legitimacy of using a comparison with the “range” in this way was acknowledged by Hunt CJ at CL in Ellis. Comparison with the “range” in this way is not applying “parity by analogy”, because an essential characteristic of the parity principle is that it permits comparison of two individual sentences and alteration of one sentence as a direct result of the comparison with the other sentence.  
     
      
    140 This accords with the statement of Howie J (with whom Tobias JA and Shaw J agreed) in R v Shepherd [2003] NSWCCA 287; (2003) 142 A Crim R 101 at [17]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In any event this exercise of comparing sentences imposed upon other offenders for different importations to support a submission that the applicant’s sentence was excessive has frequently been the subject of criticism in this Court; see for example  
        R v Bushell 
         (NSWCCA, 7 August 1998, unreported). There is a range of sentences available to a sentencing judge who has a wide discretion to choose a sentence that is appropriate to the facts and circumstances of the particular case. The comparison of sentences can be important to determine whether there is an established range of sentences for the offence for which sentence is being imposed or, in this Court, to determine whether the sentence imposed is unjustifiably outside that range. But ultimately the question for the sentencing judge and this Court is determined by the particular facts and circumstances of the matter before the court when viewed against the legislative regime for sentencing an offence of that type.” 
        
       
       
      Kardoulias 
       
      
    141 In Kardoulias v The Queen [2005] NSWCCA 456; (2005) 159 A Crim R 252 at [106], Johnson J (with whom Simpson and Rothman JJ agreed) reiterated that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… the parity principle is not to be applied when a ground of appeal invites comparison between sentences imposed upon two offenders who are not co-offenders simply because the two offenders may have similar characteristics and may have committed similar crimes”. 
        
       
       
      Nguyen 
       
      
    142 R v Nguyen [2005] NSWCCA 362; (2005) 157 A Crim R 80 does not contain any analysis of the way in which the parity principle operates, but it provides an example of this Court using the parity principle as the basis for a reduction in sentence, when the people between whom the comparison is made have not all committed the same crime. A total of six people came to be sentenced by New South Wales courts for charges that arose from three separate drug importations. One of the importations was of MDMA, another was of heroin in a bottle labelled Baileys Irish Cream, and the third was importation of both heroin and methylamphetamine through the post. It will facilitate explanation if information concerning the case is set out in tables. I shall identify the people sentenced by numbers, as follows:

    147 Offenders 1-4 were all sentenced by the one judge in the Supreme Court. Offenders 5 and 6 were both sentenced by the same District Court Judge as each other.  
     
      
    148 Thus it can be seen that all four people sentenced in the Supreme Court were charged with a different charge concerning the MDMA. 
     
      
    149 Offender 1 received, in effect, life for the MDMA charge with a non-parole period of 23 years, and an additional 2 years to be served for the Baileys charge. Offender 2 received 25 years (with 16 years non-parole period) on the MDMA charge, and in effect an additional 2 years on the Baileys charge. Offender 5 received 22 years (with non-parole of 16 years 6 months) on the MDMA charge, with in effect an additional 2 years to be served for the Baileys and the postal charges. Offender 4 was sentenced on the MDMA charge to life, with a non-parole period of 20 years. Offender 6 received 6 years, with a non-parole period of 3½ years, on the only charge against him, the Baileys charge. 
     
      
    150 The appeal against sentence was brought by offenders 1-4. Each had his or her own complaint about parity with another sentence, as follows ([29]):

    151 For reasons unconnected with parity, Grove J decided it was appropriate to re-sentence appellants 3 and 4 ([85]-[86]).  
     
      
    152 Grove J (with whom Barr and Howie JJ agreed concerning this point) upheld an aspect of the submission based on disparity. His reasoning proceeded by considering the relative culpability of the various participants in the three criminal enterprises.  
     
      
    153 The complaint of offenders 1 and 2, of disparity with offender 6 concerning the Baileys charge, was rejected at [92]: 
     
      
       
        
        “[Offender 6] was a recruited courier and his conduct and contribution to the criminal enterprise was different from, and much less culpable than, the other three who were organisers and intended sharers in any profit. No justifiable grievance could be harboured because he was treated more leniently than [offender 1] or [offender 2].” 
        
       
      
    154 Concerning the MDMA charges, his Honour said, at [87]-[90]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… [Offender 2] was involved in ‘bankrolling’ the importation for profit and actively involved to some degree in progressing the matter. That reflects participation at a very high level. [Offender 4] was a watchkeeper who reported what was being done to LAM in Hong Kong. It is difficult to perceive that [offender 4's] conduct is more culpable than that of [offender 2] who was to all intents one of the entrepreneurs. 
        
       
       
        
        … What is significant is, however, a prior conviction of [offender 4] in Hong Kong for a drug related matter. In that regard, his situation is somewhat analogous to that of [offender 5] who also had prior conviction whose non parole period for his MDMA offence was 3½ years less than that specified in the case of [offender 4]. 
        
       
       
        
        In assessing sentence there should be reflection of the criminality of each offender in accordance with what each has done in pursuit of the crime, and, although [offender 4] and [offender 5] did materially different things, I conclude that they should be assessed as having approximately equal criminal responsibility as well as broadly equivalent subjective factors. I would resentence [offender 4] to a similar term as that received by [offender 5] for his MDMA charge. 
        
       
       
        
        I remain conscious of the relativity between the entrepreneurial activity of [offender 2] and [offender 4] but assessment of her sentences require attention to issues of totality whereas [offender 4] faces the single count and there is the deprivation of leniency consequent upon the existence of his prior conviction.” 
        
       
      
    155 Because of cumulation, the Baileys charges resulted in offenders 1 and 2 in effect receiving an extra 2 years imprisonment, but the actual sentence imposed on each of them for the Baileys charges was 15 years imprisonment to date from their arrests on 16 October 2001. The actual sentences received by offenders 5 and 6 were 10 years imprisonment and 6 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 3½ years respectively.  
     
      
    156 The Crown accepted that offender 5 was a principal in the Baileys offence. Further, because he had a prior conviction for a drug offence, offender 5 was liable to life imprisonment on the Baileys charge. Grove J said, at [95]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is appropriate in all the circumstances that the terms of sentence of [offender 1] and [offender 2] for the [Baileys] offence should be coordinate with that received by [offender 5].” 
        
       
      
    157 As well, his Honour took into account considerations of parity, after various accumulations of sentence were taken into account. He said, at [99]: 
     
      
       
        
        “However, the ultimate question in my view is whether the life sentence can stand in the light of the grounds already discussed and the circumstance that two others, one of almost equivalent culpability as a principal ([offender 5]), and the other an important supervisor on behalf of another principal ([offender 4]), should receive determinate sentences. The custody to be served by [offender 5] and that to be served by [offender 1] stands in such stark contrast that I have concluded that [offender 1’s] case for intervention is made out. The conclusion receives some emphasis when it is observed that [offender 5] participated in all three of the occurrences which I initially described, [offender 1] in two of them. In my view, the discrimination would entitle [offender 1] to harbour a justifiable sense of grievance and he should receive a determinate sentence although, as a reflection of his greater culpability (even if it was only marginally so) it should be a longer term than the others.” 
        
       
      
    158 Offender 1 had been charged with a more serious crime than had offender 5 concerning the MDMA importation, and the same charge as offender 5 concerning the Baileys importation. Thus Nguyen provides an example of a sentence being reduced by comparison (at least in part) with that of a co-offender who had been charged with a less serious crime. 
     
      
       
      Rend 
       
      
    159 In Rend v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 41; (2006) 160 A Crim R 178 the appellant had been convicted of robbery (ie, not of armed robbery), and sentenced to 4 years, with a non-parole period of 2 years. The conviction was after a trial at which the appellant had pleaded not guilty. The appellant had been the driver of a motor vehicle that had stopped in a suburban street for just long enough for a man called Wormleaton to get out of the vehicle, rob a passer-by, and get back into the vehicle before it drove off. Wormleaton had pleaded guilty to charges of armed robbery, stealing a motor vehicle and being in possession of implements capable of being used to enter and drive a motor vehicle (at [3]). He received a discount of 50% for his pleas of guilty and for assistance. The sentences imposed on him were a total sentence of 2 years 6 months, with a non-parole period of 1 year 6 months for the offence of armed robbery, and for the other two offences fixed terms of imprisonment of 1 year to be served concurrently with part of the non-parole period of the sentence for armed robbery (at [96]). The judge who sentenced the applicant said that because Wormleaton was sentenced for the more serious offence of armed robbery and because he had received a discount for his pleas of guilty and his assistance, “the principle of parity of sentencing does not apply”. One of the grounds of appeal was “the applicant has a justifiable sense of grievance by virtue of the disparity between the sentence imposed upon her and that imposed upon the co-offender, Wormleaton” (at [46]). James J (with whom Buddin and Hall JJ agreed) noted that Wormleaton had been convicted of a more serious offence and had received a discount. He continued, at [106]-[109]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… notwithstanding these differences between the appellant and the co-offender Wormleaton, I consider that it was still necessary for the sentencing judge to impose a sentence on the appellant such that there would be a due proportion between the sentence passed on the appellant and the sentence or sentences passed on Wormleaton  
        Postiglione 
          
        v The Queen 
         (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 301-302 per Dawson and Gaudron JJ. The principle of due proportionality in sentencing co-offenders was applied in  
        Postiglione 
        , notwithstanding a number of differences between Postiglione and the co-offender Savvas.  
        
       
       
        
        The judge who sentenced Wormleaton quantified a combined discount for Wormleaton’s pleas of guilty and assistance as 50 per cent, so that the sentence which would have been imposed on Wormleaton for the offence of armed robbery, absent the plea of guilty and the assistance, would have been five years.  
        
       
       
        
        I accept the submission by counsel for the appellant that the sentence imposed on the appellant of four years was unduly severe, when compared with a sentence of five years, which would have been imposed on Wormleaton but for his pleas of guilty and assistance. Wormleaton was sentenced for a more serious offence of armed robbery, whereas the appellant was sentenced for the less serious offence of robbery simpliciter. It is clear that Wormleaton took the leading role in the planning of the offence for which the appellant was sentenced, the preparation for the offence and the actual carrying out of the offence. At the time of committing the offence of armed robbery, Wormleaton was on bail and subject to a bond. The sentence imposed on Wormleaton was partly concurrent with the sentences imposed for the other offences committed by Wormleaton.  
        
       
       
        
        As, in my opinion, the challenge to the appellant’s sentence based on  
        Postiglione v The Queen 
         has been made good, it is unnecessary to consider the remaining grounds of appeal against sentence. …” 
        
       
      
    160 Rend is a case on which the Applicant places particular reliance. Rend treats the parity principle as one of wider application than was actually decided by Lowe and Postiglione. It accepts that the parity principle is capable of applying to people involved in a common criminal enterprise, but who are charged with different offences, provided that in applying it the comparison takes as a given the different offences that the co-offenders have been charged with, and the consequent difference in the seriousness of their respective acts. There was no practical difficulty in taking the respective charges as a given in Rend, because the difference in the charges was part of the reason why the appellant had a justifiable sense of grievance. With respect, it is hard to see how the appellant would not have a justifiable sense of grievance when she had been convicted of a less serious crime than Wormleaton. Wormleaton had been the leader of the enterprise, had a criminal record, and was on bail at the time of the offence. Those differences clearly warranted a greater difference in the sentences than the difference between Wormleaton’s five years (undiscounted), and the appellant’s four years. 
     
      
       
      Pham 
       
      
    161 In Pham v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 25 the applicant had been convicted of knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. He was sentenced to a non-parole period of 7 years and 6 months with a balance of sentence of 2 years and 6 months. The offence of which he was convicted has a maximum penalty of life imprisonment, and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. The drugs in question had been imported from Vietnam in a single shipping container, hidden in the base of some gypsum statutes. Other men involved in the importation were Du, Ly and Lam. Du’s role involved attending the shipping company, handing over shipping documents relating to the container, paying the shipment fees, leasing (with Lam) a storage facility to which the container was eventually delivered, and on two separate occasions removing some packages from the container and taking them away. Lam’s role was co-operating with Du in leasing the storage unit, and on one occasion attending the premises with Ly, looking in the container, and having a conversation which disclosed their knowledge of the presence of drugs. Lam attended on another occasion with an offender called Nguyen, removed some of the boxes from the container and took them away. There were telephone intercepts showing that Du, Ly and Lam had been in frequent contact with each other, and Ly had been in regular phone contact with the applicant. 
     
      
    162 The applicant’s role involved arriving, with Ly, at the storage facility, unpacking the boxes, breaking the statues and removing the bases from about 177 of them, and taking them away. The remains of some of the bases of the statues were found at the applicant’s house. 
     
      
    163 One ground of appeal related to being “left with a justifiable sense of grievance due to the disparity between his sentence and the sentences imposed upon Du and Lam.” 
     
      
    164 Latham J (with whom Giles JA and Mathews AJ agreed) recorded (at [14]-[16]) the various sentences imposed: 
     
      
       
        
        “Du pleaded guilty to an offence of importation of Tier 1 goods in breach of s 233BAA(4) of the  
        Customs Act 
         1901 
         (Cth). That is an offence for which the maximum penalty is imprisonment for 5 years. An offence against him of supplying the drug did not proceed. The Judge sentenced Du to imprisonment for 2 years but suspended that sentence.  
        
       
       
        
        Ly was convicted of an offence of supplying the drug. The Judge sentenced him to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 9 years with a balance of term of 3 years.  
        
       
       
        
        Lam pleaded guilty to an offence of importation and an offence of supplying the drug. He was sentenced by her Honour Judge Morgan to imprisonment for 2 years 6 months on the importation offence and a term of imprisonment comprising a non-parole period of 8 years and a balance of term of 4 years for the supply offence. The sentences were to be served concurrently.” 
        
       
      
    165 Latham J first considered, and rejected, an argument that the sentence was manifestly excessive. She proceeded in that way “because an argument based upon parity accepts that the sentence imposed upon the applicant was otherwise appropriate” (at [17]).  
     
      
    166 (I think, with respect, that it is going too far to say that an argument based upon parity accepts that the sentence imposed upon an applicant was otherwise appropriate. One can envisage a situation where an applicant’s sentence could justifiably be reduced to a particular level by an appellate court on the ground that it was manifestly excessive, but where parity considerations led the appellate court to reduce the sentence to an even lower one.) 
     
      
    167 The applicant had argued, on the basis of Kerr, that parity can apply notwithstanding that the two offenders are charged with two completely different offences. Thus, the applicant argued, his sentence could be reduced because of its disparity with that of Du, notwithstanding the different charge of which Du was guilty. The particular argument that the applicant put was (at [31]) that Du’s criminality “seems more significant and indeed even more serious than the applicant’s”. Latham J set out the remarks of Miles AJ in Kerr and of Simpson J in Formosa. 
     
      
    168 After considering other authority in this Court that bore upon Kerr, her Honour concluded, at [36]-[38]: 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, if  
        Kerr 
         has any applicability, it must be in a very limited class of case. This Court is not generally concerned with addressing the consequences of prosecutorial discretion as it impacts upon the sentences imposed upon offenders. As Miles AJ recognised, it could not be seriously argued that a person should receive a reduction in sentence because a co-offender is not charged or where, for some reason, the charge does not proceed. Why then should a sentence be reduced because another offender is charged with a less serious offence or a lesser number of offences? How does the court inform itself of the reasons why the prosecutor acted as he or she did? Does the court interfere even if the prosecutor’s actions were completely justified?  
        
       
       
        
        If the disinterested observer is to be consulted then that observer should understand the reasons why the prosecutorial discretion was exercised as it was. If this observer also understands that the courts do not generally supervise the legitimate exercise of prosecutorial discretion or seek to address the results of its exercise, then the observer would feel no disquiet about the different sentencing outcomes. But if such disquiet does arise, it is a result of the prosecutor’s actions and not the sentences imposed by the court.  
        
       
       
        
        In my opinion there is no justifiable sense of grievance arising from the proceedings against Du or the sentence imposed upon him.” 
        
       
      
    169 What one takes from this case must bear in mind the particular submission that the court was dealing with. The invitation for the court to regard Du’s criminality as more serious than that of the applicant could not be acceded to when the applicant had been charged with the more serious crime, and no way was suggested in which the court could perceive a disparity between the sentences that did not arise from the different crimes with which they were charged. Reaching that conclusion is quite consistent with Rend, where the court saw disparity between the sentence of an applicant and that of a person charged with a more serious crime.  
     
      
    170 It will be recalled that Lam had been charged with the same offence as the applicant, though also with an additional offence. The offences with which the applicant and Lam were charged arose from the one common criminal enterprise. In accordance with the decision in Postiglione, it was permissible to apply the principle of parity to compare the sentences imposed upon the applicant and Lam, notwithstanding that Lam’s sentence may well have been influenced to some extent by principles of totality. Thus, Latham J dealt with the parity argument in relation to Lam on its merits, by considering the extent to which there were similarities and difference between the respective actions and situations of the applicant and Lam, ultimately concluding that there was no disparity between the sentences imposed on the two men. 
     
      
       
      Woodgate 
       
      
    171 In Woodgate v R [2009] NSWCCA 137, an applicant who had pleaded guilty to a charge of supply of a large commercial quantity of a prohibited drug, alleged there was a lack of parity between the sentence imposed upon him, and the sentence imposed upon a Mr Barton. Barton had pleaded guilty to a charge of being knowingly concerned in the supply of a commercial quantity of a prohibited drug. He had leased premises to Woodgate, became aware that Woodgate was using the premises for drug supply, and did nothing to stop it. Grove J (with whom Buddin and RA Hulme JJ agreed) noted that the applicant and Barton faced different charges. He said, at [45], concerning Kerr: 
     
      
       
        
        “To the extent that the decision in that case has been said to have possible applicability, it must be in a very limited class of case. It is not shown how the applicant’s situation falls within any such class, and no example of a case falling within such a class has been able to be identified or even hypothesized.” 
        
       
      
    172 He repeated with approval the remarks of Latham J in Pham concerning Kerr, and rejected the argument that the sentence should be reduced. It was, though, another case in which an attempt was made to use parity to reduce a sentence by comparing it with the sentence received by a co-offender on a less serious charge.  
     
      
       
      Shen 
       
      
    173 Shen v R [2009] NSWCCA 251 was an application for leave to appeal against a sentence imposed concerning two offences. One was trafficking in a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug, namely MDMA, contrary to section 302.2(1) Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). The other was knowingly taking part in the supply of a large commercial quantity of MDMA contrary to section 25(2) Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1985 (NSW). The Commonwealth charge related to the distribution by the applicant of 230,000 MDMA tablets. The State charge concerned an agreement to supply 10,000 MDMA tablets. No supply actually took place under that agreement because the authorities intercepted the drug before the applicant obtained it. 
     
      
    174 The applicant was sentenced to 11 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years for the Commonwealth offence, and a non-parole period of 7 years 3 months with a balance of term of 2 years and 6 months for the State offence. There was partial accumulation of the sentences, resulting in an overall sentence of 13 years, with an effective non-parole period of 9 years. 
     
      
    175 The MDMA the subject of both charges had been imported into Australia by a syndicate of which one Matthew Reed was a member. Reed was sentenced by Douglas J in the Supreme Court of Queensland in April 2007, on four counts of importing a commercial quantity of a border controlled drug contrary to the Criminal Code (Cth). Two of those counts involved cocaine, while the other two counts involved MDMA. The whole of the amount that was the subject of the first of those MDMA charges had come into the applicant’s possession. The second charge against the applicant related to the supplying of 2.26 kgs of the 33 kgs of MDMA that Reed had imported in September 2006. Reed was sentenced to concurrent terms of imprisonment of 12 years with a non-parole period of 8 years on each count. The remarks on sentence in Queensland made clear that Reed’s sentence was reduced by 50% to take account of past and future assistance, and possibly also his plea of guilty. By comparison, the trial judge who sentenced the applicant had accepted a joint approach of prosecuting and defence counsel that the combined effect of the applicant’s plea of guilty and past assistance justified a discount of 35%.  
     
      
    176 The applicant’s submission was that, even allowing for the different offences with which he and Reed had been charged, and for the differences in sentencing practices between New South Wales and Queensland (most notably that wholly concurrent terms of imprisonment for all offences of the type and scale in which Reed was involved was contrary to New South Wales practice) the sentences were disproportionate. Reed was a senior member of the importation syndicate – indeed only one person was senior to him in it – and he had been personally involved in reasonably complex arrangements, involving international travel and importation of the goods concealed in ordinary items of commerce. As well, the applicant had agreed to supply only a small part of Reed’s second importation. Notwithstanding those matters, the applicant was sentenced to a significantly longer effective sentence than Reed. 
     
      
    177 Fullerton J (with whom Hodgson JA and Howie J agreed) upheld that submission. 
     
      
    178 After noting the principle in Postiglione and the remarks of Latham J in Pham, Fullerton J continued, at [32]-[33]: 
     
      
       
        
        “While it is true that the Commonwealth prosecuting authority in the present case laid different charges against Reed and the applicant (in part, it would seem, as a result of the fact that Reed was arrested in Queensland and the applicant in New South Wales) and that this had the effect of invoking different statutory sentencing regimes and different approaches of principle to the question of accumulation, the same statutory maximum of life imprisonment applied to all offences. In addition, it is important to emphasise that despite the differences in the objective criminality of the applicant and Reed the dominant offending of both was contrary to the Commonwealth  
        Criminal Code 
        , albeit that Reed was charged with importing the border controlled drug that the applicant was charged with trafficking there was a marked overlap and interconnection between their offending. In the particular circumstances of this case, to point to the different charges and the different State sentencing regimes as justifying the disproportion between the applicant’s sentence and Reed’s sentence understates the importance of the overriding principle of equal justice and its legitimate operation in this case.  
        
       
       
        
        Despite his Honour having said that he would ‘bear in mind’ the sentences imposed on Reed, I am satisfied that a greater allowance ought to have been made for relative parity in sentencing the applicant particularly since it was not suggested to his Honour (and not submitted to this Court) that the sentences imposed on Reed were manifestly inadequate, despite the fact that the sentences are markedly out of step with sentences imposed in this state for importing commercial quantities of a border controlled drug (see  
        R v To 
         [2007] NSWCCA 200; 172 A Crim R 121 where Hulme and Hall JJ reviewed a number of recent sentences where commercial quantities of MDMA were imported and where significantly longer sentences were imposed). In circumstances where the Crown on the appeal does not advance a submission that the individual sentences imposed on Reed were manifestly inadequate, or that the overall sentence was extremely lenient given his repeated and serious offending over an extended period, it is not for this Court, of its own volition, to make such a finding and to refuse to intervene for that reason.” 
        
       
      
    179 Thus Shen provides another example of parity being applied when the applicant seeks to compare with the sentence of a person who has committed a different crime, but where the maximum penalty applicable to both of the crimes in question is the same. 
     
      
       
      OM 
       
      
    180 OM v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 267 was an appeal against sentence by four of a group of six teenage boys who had committed a series of sexual assaults, against the one teenage girl, on the one day. Five of the boys had committed their respective assaults in each other’s company, at two separate locations. The complainant then travelled with two of the boys to a third location, where one of those boys had a conversation on his mobile phone and shortly afterwards OM (who had not been involved in the earlier events of that day) arrived and committed a sexual assault on the complainant.  
     
      
    181 The majority judgment of Fullerton and McCallum JJ allowed appeals by four of the boys (including OM) on the basis of disparity between the sentences imposed on them, and the sentences that were imposed upon the two other boys involved. Their Honours recognised that the ground of appeal invoking disparity in sentencing was one that applied only between co-offenders (at [31], [34]). They proceeded on what appears to be an unchallenged assumption that all the boys were co-offenders. Each boy had been charged with a contravention of the same provision of the criminal law, namely section 66C(2) Crimes Act 1900, which relates to aggravated sexual intercourse with a child under 14. The circumstance of aggravation in each case was that the offences were committed in company.  
     
      
    182 Because all the boys were charged with a contravention of the same provision of the criminal law, there was not the difficulty that was exhibited in Pham of seeing disparity between the sentence of the applicant and the sentence of a co-offender charged with a less serious offence. 
     
      
    183 It is well enough established that a case is not binding authority for something it assumes rather than decides: CSR Ltd v Eddy [2005] HCA 64; (2005) 226 CLR 1 at 11 [13]; Markisic v Commonwealth of Australia [2007] NSWCA 92; (2007) 69 NSWLR 737 at 748 [56] and cases there cited. However, that experienced criminal judges proceed on a particular basis can provide some reason to believe that the assumption is justified, even though their decision is not binding authority that the assumption has been correctly made. Fairly clearly, the boys had not all committed the self-same crime, in the way that participants in a robbery all commit the same robbery – each had committed his own individual crime against the victim. They were co-offenders in the sense that, even though they were not charged with conspiracy, their actions were all part of the one criminal enterprise (though OM’s connection with that enterprise was more tenuous than that of the others).  
     
      
    184 Basten JA, who concurred in the result, similarly said that all the boys were co-offenders (at [1], [3], [6]). At [8], Basten JA referred to the judgments of Hunt CJ at CL in Ellis. He noted that while Hunt CJ at CL had: 
     
      
       
        
        “… referred to the principle as applicable to ‘co-offenders’, his Honour did not comment on whether the principle applied only to those who were put on trial together, to those who were charged with the same offence, or (more broadly) to those who were involved in a common criminal enterprise, whether or not they were charged with the same offence or tried together.” 
        
       
      
    185 Basten JA, at [9]-[12], gave explicit consideration to who were “co-offenders” for the purpose of the parity principle: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is clear that the question of disparity need not arise only where offenders are tried (or sentenced) together. Indeed, most cases involving complaints of disparity arise in circumstances where the offenders are sentenced by different judges or at different times. In  
        Lowe 
        , the co-offenders were jointly indicted for the one offence (an armed robbery). However, in  
        Jones 
        , although both offenders were charged with supply of the same cannabis, the offences were not technically the same, one offender having supplied the drug to the other. Nevertheless, the judgment of the Court, delivered by Brennan J, used the term ‘co-offenders’.  
        
       
       
        
        The distinction between the comparison with a co-offender and the comparison with other offences in which the applicant played no part is a matter of critical importance in determining the limits of the application of the principle of parity. In  
        R v Armstrong 
         [2001] NSWCCA 77, the language of disparity was used in relation to an applicant who was one of a number of ‘runners’ employed by an organisation distributing drugs in the Kings Cross area. The Court did not intervene to reduce the applicant’s sentence, but not because it concluded they were not co-offenders.  
        
       
       
        
        In  
        Stanton v Regina 
         [2008] NSWCCA 326, the applicant was sentenced on a number of counts involving the supply of prohibited drugs. The question of parity arose in relation to another person sentenced in respect of what appear to have been similar drug offences arising out of the same ‘controlled operation’ conducted by police over a period of one month with respect to a motorcycle gang. The Court did not seek to identify whether the applicant and the co-offender were knowingly concerned in the same particular offences.  
        
       
       
        
        It thus appears that the disparity principle operates with respect to persons who may not have committed the same offence, but have been involved in a course of criminal activity through some kind of association over a limited period of time. It would require a departure from that approach (for which the Director did not contend) to avoid the application of the principle in the present case.” 
        
       
      
    186 It is not, with respect, clear to me that the account that Basten JA gives in [9] of the facts of Jones is correct. While it is true that the male offender in Jones had physically delivered the cannabis to the applicant in that case, the judgments in both the Court of Criminal Appeal and the High Court are consistent with the “supply” that was the subject of the charge against the male offender being the supply that the applicant made to her retail customer, concerning which the applicant and the male offender shared the proceeds (see para [61] and [62] above). On that view of the facts, the offences that the applicant and her male co-offender committed were indeed the same offence.  
     
      
    187 R v Armstrong [2001] NSWCCA 77 was an appeal against sentence by a woman who had been a street seller of cocaine working for an organisation who engaged several such sellers. She alleged disparity with the sentence imposed upon another seller for the same organisation, not shown to have been known to her, who had received a much lighter sentence. The judgment of Barr J (with whom Studdert J agreed) proceeded on an assumption that the applicant and the other street seller were co-offenders. The ratio of the case, at [22], was that the sentence imposed on the other street vendor “was far less than a proper sentence” and “This Court is not bound to reduce a sentence by reference to another sentence passed upon a co-offender, if, in all the circumstances, it appears that that other sentence is unjustifiably low”.  
     
      
    188 One of the authorities that Barr J relied upon for that proposition was Diamond (NSWCCA, 18 February 1993, unreported) where Hunt CJ at CL said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The issue is whether the particular sense of grievance (or of injustice) is a legitimate one. There is, in my view, a stage at which the inadequacy of the sentence imposed upon the co-offender is so grave that the sense of grievance engendered can no longer be regarded as a legitimate one.” 
        
       
       
      To similar effect are  
      Rexhaj  
      (NSWCCA, 29 February 1996, unreported) and  
      R v Isamunadar  
      [2002] NSWCCA 477; (2002) 136 A Crim R 206 at 217 [23]-[26], 220 [37]-[38]. 
       
      
    189 While Armstrong did not involve a decision that the two people whose sentences were being compared were co-offenders, it provides another example of a highly experienced criminal judge making the assumption that people related as the sellers were in Armstrong – participants in a common criminal enterprise, in that each is, unknown to the other, a seller for a common vendor – are co-offenders for the purpose of the parity principle.  
     
      
    190 Stanton v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 326 was a sentence appeal where the applicant had been convicted of one count of supplying a prohibited drug, and three counts of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug. Three further offences of knowingly taking part in the supply of a prohibited drug were included on a Form 1. The man referred to as the applicant’s co-offender, called Keen, had pleaded guilty to two counts of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug, and three counts of supply of a prohibited drug. Concerning Keen, there were five matters of supplying a prohibited drug taken into account on a Form 1. The offence of ongoing supply of a prohibited drug has a maximum penalty of 20 years’ imprisonment, by comparison with a maximum penalty of 15 years’ imprisonment and/or a fine of $220,000 for the offence of supplying a prohibited drug. Both the applicant and the “co-offender” were involved in a drug distribution organisation that was connected with a motorcycle gang. The charges against the applicant related to supplies on 14 March 2007, 24 April 2007, and dates in between. The Form 1 items relating to the applicant also fell within that date range. The charges against Keen related to acts of supply occurring on 15 March 2007, 14 June 2007, and dates in between. Thus, the applicant’s act of supply on 14 March 2007 was a supply that the “co-offender” was not shown to be involved in. 
     
      
    191 There were five separate acts of supply that the applicant was involved in, between 15 March 2007 and 4 April 2007, that were also the subject of the five charges of ongoing supply against Keen. Three of those acts of supply were ones that were taken into account in relation to the applicant on a Form 1, each for the applicant knowingly taking part in the supply. The other two of those five acts of supply were ones where the applicant was actually convicted of knowingly taking part in the supply. 
     
      
    192 There was another act of supply of a particular drug on 24 April 2007, in relation to which Keen was charged with supplying the drug, and the applicant was charged with knowingly taking part in the supply. All the other charges against Keen were ones that the applicant was not shown to have had any involvement in. A table setting out the precise relationship between the various acts of supply, and the charges against the applicant and Keen in relation to each, appears at para [20] of the judgment. 
     
      
    193 It is only in a very small number of the 40 paragraphs of the judgment of Beazley JA that Mr Keen is not referred to as a co-offender. It appears from a Crown submission recorded at [33] that the Crown proceeded on the basis that the two men were co-offenders.  
     
      
    194 Thus, Stanton is another case where it was assumed, rather than decided, that the two people involved were co-offenders. The result in Stanton was that the applicant’s sentence was reduced. The fact that his “co-offender” had committed different crimes to the applicant was not seen as an obstacle to that result.  
     
      
    195 While the proposition that Basten JA states in para [12] in OM is consistent with the cases on which he bases it, it is not one compelled by them. However there are many other cases that are also consistent with it. 
     
      
       
      Huang and Siu 
       
      
    196 The Applicant reminded us that this Court’s judgment in Huang & Siu referred in para [1] to Huang and Siu as being co-offenders. That was a case in which the parity principle was not involved at all. When there was no occasion for the court either to assume or to decide whether they were co-offenders for the purpose of the parity principle, this reference to them as being co-offenders leads nowhere for present purposes.  
     
      
       
      Three Cases the Applicant Relies On  
       
      
    197 Three cases are relied upon by the Applicant as being recent examples of the application of the parity principle. One of them, Tuifua v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 224; (2008) 189 A Crim R 1, was a case involving co-offenders in the sense already recognised by the High Court, because each had pleaded guilty to a charge of conspiracy to commit (the one) armed robbery. Thus, it does not advance the present argument. The second, Melikian v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 156, proceeded on the basis that an applicant who had pleaded guilty to a charge of knowingly taking part in the supply of heroin, was a co-offender with someone charged with supplying heroin. They had acted together in acquiring the heroin that was to be supplied. The disparity that this Court (Spigelman CJ, Hidden and Price JJ) found resulted in the sentence being reduced. The third case, Hudson v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 59, is another case where it was assumed without deciding, that the parity principle applied, and the appeal was rejected on the ground that there was no marked disparity. The result means that the making of the assumption has the effect that it is of limited use for present purposes.  
     
      
       
      The Queensland View of Proper Scope of Parity Principle 
       
      
    198 The same conclusion as I have arrived at concerning the scope of operation of the parity principle has been arrived at in Queensland without reference to the New South Wales course of authority. R v AAH & AAG [2009] QCA 321 concerned the sentences imposed on four men who had participated in a gang rape of a complainant D. Two of those men, the Hussein brothers had also, on another occasion, together raped another complainant, C, in circumstances that bore a marked similarity to the circumstances of D’s rape. The Husseins had been sentenced for their participation in both rapes before the applicants were sentenced. Chesterman JA (with whom Fraser JA agreed, at [9], in this respect) said, at [21]-[22]: 
     
      
       
        
        “The parity principle applies only to co-offenders:  
        Postiglione v R 
         (1997) 189 CLR 295 at 325 per Gummow J:  
        Lowe v R 
         (1984) 154 CLR 606 at 609 per Gibbs CJ, at 611 per Mason J and at 617–18 per Brennan J. 
        
       
       
        
        The applicants and the Husseins were only co-offenders with respect to the series of offences against complainant D. As to those offences the disparity in penalties imposed upon the Husseins and on the applicants is in the applicants’ favour and is explained by their co-operation with the administration of justice. The applicants were not co-offenders with the Husseins with respect to the offences against complainant C for which they were sentenced to 15 and 15 and a half years imprisonment. The comparison between those sentences and those imposed on the applicants does not invoke the parity principle.” 
        
       
      
    199 The “series of offences against the complainant D” were the various individual acts of rape that each of the men had committed. This case is authority, not just assumption, that the parity principle is capable of applying between people who participate in a common criminal enterprise even if they do not all commit the self-same crime.  
     
      
       
      Is This A type of Case to Which the Parity Principle Could Never Apply? 
       
      
    200 There is one case, namely Wurramarbra, that speaks as though as a matter of principle the parity principle is capable of applying only between people who have committed the same crime. The statement in Krakouer that I have set out at para [108] above might be read as suggesting that the principle can be applied only where the offenders in question are charged under the one Act, or (possibly) for the same “kind” of offence.  
     
      
    201 Gleeson CJ in Watson was not so emphatic – rather he said that when two offenders are charged with “significantly different crimes” considerations of parity are “difficult to apply”, and he decided that parity was inapplicable in the case before him because the particular charges involved were “so different”. Krakouer does not purport to give a test of when the parity principle does, and does not apply – rather, it gives a reason why the principle does not apply in that particular case. Krakouer might be explicable on the basis that it is a case of the same type as Pham and Woodgate, where the applicant sought to obtain the benefit of parity by comparison with the sentence of someone who had been charged with an offence less serious than his own, and no basis was provided on which the difference arising from the differing charges could be factored out of the difference between the sentences. Further, it is not clear what the judges intended in Wurramarba when they said that “different considerations apply” when “the person convicted of the more serious offence receives a sentence which is less than the person convicted of the less serious offence, all other aspects being approximately equal.” It is in precisely that situation that other judges have regarded the parity principle as capable of application. There are numerous examples of the parity principle being applied to reduce the sentence of one of the participants in a common criminal enterprise even though they have not all committed the self-same crime: Sumner; Nguyen; Rend; Shen; OM; Melikian; AAH & AAG. There are also cases where the judge has proceeded on the basis that the parity principle could apply between people who had participated in a common criminal enterprise but not committed the same crime, though in the result the sentence was not actually reduced: Armstrong; Hudson. As well, one aspect of Kerr was that parity with the sentence of a participant in the same criminal enterprise but who had been charged with a different crime was a legitimate consideration. In Formosa Simpson J was not prepared to reject that aspect of Kerr, though she recognised that there would be practical difficulties in its application in that circumstance. 
     
      
    202 Even though there was no issue squarely raised in the cases mentioned in the previous paragraph except AAH & AAG, as there has been in this, of whether as a matter of principle the parity principle can apply between people who have not committed the self-same crime, it is not to be supposed that the large number of judges who proceeded in this way did so by oversight. As the facts of Sumner, Nguyen, Rend, Shen, OM and Melikian illustrate, unequal treatment that is so great as to bring about a justifiable sense of grievance can sometimes arise between participants in a common criminal enterprise who have committed different crimes. In my view there is no obstacle of the type the Crown submits to the parity principle being applied simply because a case is one in which the sentence by comparison with which the sentence under appeal is sought to be reduced was for a different crime.  
     
      
    203 There are significant limitations, however, on reducing a sentence on the basis of that of a co-offender who has committed a different crime. At least some of the limits on the use of the parity principle in such a case are:  
     
      
       
      1. It cannot overcome those differences in sentence that arise from a prosecutorial decision about whether to charge a person at all, or with what crime to charge them:  
      Howard 
      ;  
      Wurramarbra 
      ;  
      Formosa 
       
       
      2. If it is used to compare the sentences of participants in the same criminal enterprise who have been charged with different crimes, there can be significant practical difficulties. Those practical difficulties become greater the greater the difference between the crimes charged becomes, and can become so great that in the circumstances of a particular case a judge cannot apply it, or cannot see that there is any justifiable sense of grievance arising from the discrepancy:  
      Gibson 
      ;  
      Howard 
      ;  
      Formosa 
       
       
      3. It cannot overcome differences in sentence that arise from one of the co-offenders having been given a sentence that is unjustifiably low:  
      Armstrong 
      ;  
      Diamond 
      ;  
      Rexhaj 
      ;  
      Isamundar 
       
       
      4. There are particular difficulties in an applicant succeeding in a disparity argument where the disparity is said to arise by comparison with the sentence imposed on a co-offender who has been charged with an offence that is less serious than that of the applicant:  
      Krakouer 
      ;  
      Pham 
      ;  
      Woodgate 
      . See also  
      R v Stanbouli  
      [2003] NSWCCA 355; 141 A Crim R 531 at [127]-[134].  
      However  
      Nguyen 
       stands as one example where that result arose.  
       
       
      Application to Facts 
       
      
    204 There is no basis in the Agreed Facts for concluding that the Applicant knew of the existence of Huang or Siu. There is no basis in the Agreed Facts for concluding that the Applicant knew that Mr Chen had ever engaged another person to take money to the bank for remission to Hong Kong in parcels of less than $10,000. The period when the Applicant was taking money to the bank for Mr Chen did not coincide, or even overlap, with the periods when Siu and Huang were taking money to the bank for Mr Chen. The sums of money that the Applicant remitted to Hong Kong are different to the sums of money that each of Huang and Siu remitted to Hong Kong. Thus, the Applicant, Siu and Huang, did not commit the same crime. However, it is clear that the Applicant, Siu and Huang were all being used by Mr Chen as part of an enterprise involving the repeated commission of crimes of a similar character. That suffices, in my view, to make them participants in a common criminal enterprise. The Crown’s submission that the parity principle cannot apply because they are not co-offenders in the relevant sense fails. 
     
      
    205 While the Applicant and Huang were not charged with contravention of the same provision of the criminal law, the offence with which Huang was charged is a more serious one than the offence with which the Applicant was charged. Thus the particular difficulties of applying the parity principle to effect a comparison with the sentence imposed on a co-offender charged with a lesser offence do not arise. 
     
      
    206 The Crown correctly points out that the parity principle was not specifically relied upon before the sentencing judge, by either the Crown or the Applicant. While the judgment in the Crown appeals concerning Huang and Siu were relied on in submissions, it was on the basis that they provided the closest comparative sentence cases available. However, the Crown does not submit that, because the principle was not relied on in the court below, it is not open to this Court to consider whether the parity principle should properly be applied.  
     
      
       
       PART D – OTHER ASPECTS OF THE “PARITY” APPEAL 
       
       
      Different Sentences Justified? 
       
      
    207 The Crown submits that if its first argument fails (as it does), there were differences between the circumstances of the Applicant, Huang and Siu that justify the sentence that the judge imposed on the Applicant. 
     
      
    208 Huang was sentenced for a different offence, that has a higher maximum penalty. He provided assistance held to be “truly exceptional” and “extremely valuable”. While the Applicant offered assistance, that offer proved “fruitless”. Huang would remain in protective custody for the duration of his sentence, which would be burdensome to him, while there was no suggestion that the Applicant would be placed into protective custody. 
     
      
    209 There were also significant differences, the Crown submitted, between the Applicant and Siu. Siu was much older, a disabled pensioner, and in poor health. It was accepted that Siu’s time in custody would be much harder than for a healthy young male by reason of his medical conditions. By comparison, the Applicant was aged 37 when he started offending, 43 when sentenced, and had no adverse health condition. It was Siu’s personal subjective circumstances, including his age and compromised state of health, that played a large part in the adoption of a 50% ratio between his non-parole period and his head sentence.  
     
      
    210 Apart from these matters, it is also submitted to be relevant – indeed highly relevant – that the sentences actually imposed on Huang and Siu were each the product of successful Crown appeals. In accordance with the usual practice in this State concerning Crown appeals, because permitting the Crown to appeal at all exposes a convicted person to double jeopardy of being punished, the sentences that were imposed following the successful appeal were at or towards the low end of the permissible range for a sentence on those particular people, bearing in mind both the objective and subjective circumstances of each: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 341 [62]; R v Holder [1983] 3 NSWLR 245 at 256, 269-70; R v Wall [2002] NSWCA 42; (2002) 71 NSWLR 692 at 707 [70] (e); R v Underwood [2005] VSCA 80 at [2]. (A different approach to sentencing on Crown appeals has now been adopted in Queensland: R v Lacey; Ex parte Attorney-General (Qld) [2009] QCA 274 at [114] ff & esp [114]-[153] per de Jersey CJ, Keane, Muir and Chesterman JJA, a decision influenced by peculiarities of the relevant Queensland legislation.) 
     
      
    211 In applying the parity principle it is permissible to compare the sentence of an applicant with a sentence that has been imposed on a co-offender following a Crown appeal: R v Guzman [2000] NSWCCA 261 at [20]; R v Christie [2000] NSWCCA 354 at [15]; Sharpe v The Queen [2002] NSWCCA 96 at [21]; Bowtell v The Queen [2004] NSWCCA 17 at [30]-[31]; Em v The Queen [2006] NSWCCA 336 at [131]. However, that it is possible to compare an applicant’s sentence and the sentence that a co-offender has received following a Crown appeal does not answer the question of how one goes about making that comparison.  
     
      
    212 In Christie at [19], Fitzgerald JA (with whom Newman and James JJ agreed) said: 
     
      
       
        
        “An otherwise appropriate sentence imposed on an offender is reduced if that is necessary to ensure that he or she is not treated unjustly compared to a co-offender,  
        even a co-offender to whom leniency has been extended 
        , unless the co-offender’s sentence is unsuitable as a basis for comparison because of manifest error.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    213 Fitzgerald JA is clearly referring to a person sentenced on a Crown appeal as being the relevant “co-offender to whom leniency has been extended”, because of the leniency involved in sentencing at the bottom end of the range in Crown appeals. However, this statement says nothing about how one decides whether an applicant has been “treated unjustly compared to a co-offender”. In the result, Fitzgerald JA was able to find, at [20], sufficient differences between the applicant’s position and that of his co-offender (not including any difference arising from the fact that the co-offender had been sentenced on a Crown appeal) to mean that there was not a marked disparity between their sentences. 
     
      
    214 As I read Christie, it is not authority for the proposition that in comparing the sentence of an applicant with that of a co-offender, one must leave out of account that the co-offender’s sentence was imposed on a Crown appeal in deciding whether there is a marked discrepancy between them, or whether the applicant has been treated unjustly by comparison with the co-offender.  
     
      
    215 Other authority has recognised that, in effecting the comparison between the two sentences, it can be a relevant difference between the situations of the applicant and the co-offender that the sentence on the co-offender was the result of a Crown appeal: R v Salameh (NSWCCA, 9 June 1994, unreported) at 3; El Hassan v The Queen [2003] NSWCCA 252 at [13]; Bowtell v The Queen [2004] NSWCCA 17 at [35]; Kauwenberghs v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 98; (2008) 186 A Crim R 197 at [109]; Osman v The Queen [2008] NSWCCA 157 at [38]. 
     
      
    216 In my view, the result arrived at in these cases is justifiable in principle. It is a subjective circumstance of the co-offender that he or she has, contrary to the usual principles of the criminal law, twice been put in jeopardy of being punished at the instance of the Crown. That subjective circumstance is one that has resulted in the co-offender receiving a lesser sentence than he or she otherwise might have received. That subjective factor is one not applicable to the applicant (save in the situation which could in theory arise where the respondent to a Crown appeal against sentence argues that the court should take into account parity with the sentence of a co-offender concerning whom a Crown appeal has succeeded). Just as it is possible, in deciding whether there is a disparity between the sentence of an applicant and a co-offender, to take into account that the co-offender has received a lesser sentence than he or she otherwise might have received because of a subjective factor like age or ill health, so it is possible to take into account that the co-offender has received a lesser sentence than he or she might otherwise have received because that sentence was imposed on a Crown appeal. 
     
      
    217 When re-sentencing Huang and Siu, this Court was quite explicit about the extent of the leniency that it granted to them by virtue of the sentencing being done on Crown appeal. For Huang, a starting point of the 11 years was adopted, notwithstanding that, had it not been a Crown appeal, the appropriate starting point was between 12 and 14 years (para [42] above). For Siu, the starting point adopted was 8 years, notwithstanding that, had it not been a Crown appeal, a more appropriate starting point would have been between 9 and 11 years (para [45] above). The extent of the leniency arising from them having been sentenced on a Crown appeal must be taken into account in the comparison between their sentences and that of the Applicant. 
     
      
    218 As noted earlier, this Court’s reasons in the Crown appeal concerning Huang and Siu had been delivered before the Applicant was sentenced. Submissions were made to her Honour about how the objective and subjective circumstances of the Applicant compared with those of Huang and Siu. Even though those submissions were not made to her Honour for the purpose of an application of the parity principle, they are entitled to some weight unless shown in some respects to be mistaken. 
     
      
    219 Her Honour specifically recognised “the serious nature of this offence, and its maximum penalty.” She held that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… although I accept … that this accused was a relatively minor player compared to Mr Chen and others in the whole scheme of things, but money laundering warrants severe punishment, not the least in order to reflect general deterrence to a very significant degree.” 
        
       
      
    220 The judge referred explicitly to similarities and differences between the respective cases of the Applicant and Mr Siu, including the difference in the amount of money involved, and the number of transactions involved. She concluded: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I am of the view that taking into account the objective seriousness of the offence and the subjective circumstances that I have referred to, this is a case that is in the mid to lower range of seriousness. I would assess somewhat less serious than the objective and subjective circumstances in the case of Siu but not significantly so.” 
        
       
      
    221 The Crown also submits that, even if there were a disparity between the sentences imposed on the Applicant on the one hand and Huang and Siu on the other, Lowe requires there to be a “marked disparity” (per Gibbs CJ at 610 (with whom Wilson J agreed), per Mason J at 611) or “[t]he difference … must be manifestly excessive and call for the intervention of an appellate court in the interests of justice” (per Dawson J at 624 (with whom Wilson J agreed)).  
     
      
    222 In my view it can distort the principle that is being applied if one tries to break it up into elements, as this submission presupposes one should. What Dawson and Gaudron JJ in Postiglione required, before an appellate court intervenes, is “a marked disparity which gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance”. There is a sense in which every difference between sentences, even for the same crime, is a disparity, because equal treatment has not been meted out. What the composite phrase conveys is that what matters is not only the fact of difference but also its extent and whether the difference can be explained by reference to the principles on which the criminal trial process including criminal sentencing operates. The elements of the composite phrase are coloured by each other, and if the elements are considered separately there is a risk that some of that colour will be lost.  
     
      
    223 I am not persuaded that there is the marked discrepancy which gives rise to a justifiable sense of grievance in the present case. The notional head sentence of the Applicant, of seven years, is well short of the 12 to 14 years that would have been appropriate for Huang if he were not being re-sentenced on a Crown appeal. That difference is not out of keeping with the greater seriousness of Huang’s criminality, as shown by the different offence with which Huang was charged, the longer time over which his activities occurred, and the larger sum of money involved. The Applicant’s offending had occurred over a long enough period not to be regarded as an isolated offence.  
     
      
    224 Nor is there the relevant sort of marked discrepancy between the Applicant’s sentence and that of Siu. There were aspects of the objective circumstances that made Siu’s criminality greater (the greater number and value of transactions, and his understanding that the money had an illegal source), but his subjective circumstances were more favourable to a lessening of what otherwise might be an appropriate sentence than were the subjective circumstances of the Applicant. The appropriate head sentence for Siu, absent a Crown appeal, of between 9 and 11 years, is in keeping with the undiscounted sentence of the Applicant. 
     
      
       
       PART E – THE NON-PAROLE PERIOD 
       
      
    225 The judge both gave her reasons, and sentenced the Applicant, on 19 September 2008.  
     
      
    226 When the judge had reached the stage in her remarks on sentence of having decided on a starting point for a head sentence of 7 years, and discounts totalling 50%, leading to a head sentence of 3½ years, her reasons continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “I note that the accused has spent seventy-eight days in gaol and I will attempt to take that into account and I will round it off and I will say now that I will round that down at two and a half months. Therefore when fixing a non-parole period, again I find no special circumstances. …  
        
       
       
        
        A sixty per cent non-parole period is in my view appropriate. 
        
       
       
        
        If counsel can just give me a little assistance in relation to the time he has already served. Different courts have different practices. Some adopt the fairly artificial but much easer to calculate approach of backdating a sentence to a time before today. 
        
       
       
        
        [CROWN]: They are. I think – this is almost a pragmatic approach, your Honour – but for ease and working out the reduction, it might be simpler to deduct two and a half months from the three and a half year head sentence. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: And have the sentence start today. 
        
       
       
        
        [CROWN]: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: Mr Wilkinson, do you agree-- 
        
       
       
        
        WILKINSON: I don’t wish to be heard. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: You don’t wish to be heard? 
        
       
       
        
        WILKINSON: No.” 
        
       
      
    227 When actually imposing the sentence on the Applicant, the judge said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The term of the imprisonment that I propose to sentence you is based on a three and a half year head sentence but because you have spent in total around about two and a half months in gaol already before you were granted bail, I propose to sentence you to a period of imprisonment of thirty-nine months to commence today with a non-parole period of twenty-six months or two years and two months to commence today. That means that you will be eligible for release on parole on 18 November 2010. And you will then be on parole for an additional thirteen months which will expire on 18 December 2011. 
        
       
       
        
        Counsel, as I am doing this on the run, I am happy for you to look at those dates and let me know if I have made an arithmetical error, because that sometimes happens and I’d rather know now before everybody goes away. 
        
       
       
        
        [CROWN]: We think that’s correct, your Honour. The head sentence is 39 months and will expire on 18 2011 [sic]. 
        
       
       
        
        HER HONOUR: The non-parole period expires on 18 November 2010. And I have made fairly strictly a two-thirds, one-third because that turned out to be, in my view, the appropriate way to deal with pa",2010-04-08 00:00:00,NSW Court of Criminal Appeal

      NON-PUBLICATION ORDER 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused Mark Robin Wilhelm was indicted before me today on an indictment containing three counts.  
     
      
    2 The first count alleges, in effect, that he unlawfully killed Ms Brimble on board a cruise ship, the Pacific Sky, on 24 September 2002. That of course is an offence of manslaughter. It carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for twenty-five years.  
     
      
    3 The second count is an alternative to the first count. It alleges an offence under s 39 of the Crimes Act. That section is entitled ""Using poison et cetera to endanger the life or inflict grievous bodily harm"". The section has a very long history and is derived from the English Offences Against the Persons Act from Victorian times. The charge alleged that on the same day, that is 24 September 2002, on board the Pacific Sky the accused, recklessly as to injuring Ms Dianne Brimble, did cause to be taken by Ms Brimble a noxious substance which is known as GHB and the thing caused to be taken inflicted upon Dianne Brimble grievous bodily harm. The accused pleaded guilty to that count. The offence carries a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 10 years. 
     
      
    4 The third count on the indictment alleges that on the same day, that is 24 September 2002, the accused supplied a prohibited drug, being GHB, to Ms Brimble. The accused inconsistently with the plea to the second count pleaded not guilty to this offence. 
     
      
    5 The Crown indicated that it was prepared to accept the plea to the second count in discharge of the indictment. However that plea cannot discharge the accused from the third count as it was a separate charge. 
     
      
    6 The matter has a lengthy and unfortunate history. The accused stood trial before me and a jury last year on an indictment alleging two charges; the first being the offence of manslaughter and the second being an offence of supply. He pleaded ""not guilty"" to each of those counts on the indictment.  
     
      
    7 The Crown initially alleged that the accused was guilty of manslaughter on two bases; the first being an unlawful and dangerous act manslaughter based upon his supply of the GHB to Ms Brimble and therefore substantially causing her death and the second base being gross criminal negligence. The second count was the same as the third count on this indictment, being an offence of supply of GHB to Ms Brimble. 
     
      
    8 Before addresses to the jury I indicated my view to the Crown Prosecutor that it was impossible for the Crown to make out the offence of manslaughter based upon gross criminal negligence, it being an allegation of the accused's failure to assist Ms Brimble, with a result that that failure caused her death. In my view the evidence did not give rise to any of the elements of gross criminal negligence manslaughter, including that there was no duty of care between the accused and Ms Brimble. The Crown ultimately withdrew that basis of manslaughter from the jury because the Crown acknowledged that it could not prove that Ms Brimble was alive at the time at which the Crown was alleging that the accused had failed to assist her. 
     
      
    9 The matter, therefore, went to the jury, despite a large number of photographs which were indecent and which were highly prejudicial to the accused but which the Crown relied upon to prove the charge of manslaughter based on gross criminal negligence. Notwithstanding my view that the accused's fair trial had been placed in jeopardy by the failed basis of manslaughter on gross criminal negligence, the accused elected to continue with the trial. 
     
      
    10 The jury were ultimately unable to bring in a verdict on the first count of manslaughter. They did have a verdict on the second count but, having been told by the Crown that it intended at that stage, or at least could not tell me that it was not intended, to re-try the accused on the charge of manslaughter, I refused to accept a verdict from the jury on the charge of supply. The jury were discharged. Eventually the Crown decided that it would continue the prosecution of Mr Wilhelm on the charge of manslaughter. The matter was listed for trial today. 
     
      
    11 At a mention of the matter about a week before today I was informed that there was likely to be a plea and that, therefore, the trial might not proceed. In order that the accused not be prejudiced by such negotiations, that matter was not made public. 
     
      
    12 This morning this indictment was presented before me. I immediately raised with the Crown and with the accused's representative my concerns about the second count. That count alleges that the accused caused Ms Brimble to take a noxious substance, being GHB. I pointed out to the Crown that there were a number of cases which tended to suggest, at least to me, that what was required for the Crown to prove was that the accused stood in a position of authority or control over Ms Brimble so that he could, in effect, overbore her will and therefore cause her to take the drug. I had a good idea of what the evidence was, having been the trial judge, and I had difficulty in seeing, on the evidence that was at the trial of the accused, how it could be said that he had any authority or position of control over Ms Brimble whereby he could, in effect, cause her to take the drug. 
     
      
    13 The Crown submitted that it was not necessary for the Crown to prove those facts but it was merely sufficient to prove that the accused gave Ms Brimble the drug and encouraged her to take it. I indicated to the Crown that there was a number of authorities that seemed to me to be against that proposition. 
     
      
    14 One of those authorities is Castle v Olen (1985) 3 NSWLR 26, a judgment of Yeldham J, which is concerned with an offence of causing another person to supply a dangerous drug. Yeldham J at 30 quoted a passage from the judgment of the High Court in O'Sullivan v Truth Sportsman Limited (1957) 96 CLR 220 at 228 which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “… This appears to mean that when it is made an offence by or under statute for one man to ‘cause’ the doing of a prohibited act by another the provision is not to be understood as referring to any description of antecedent event or condition produced by the first man which contributed to the determination of the will of the second man to do the prohibited act. Nor is it enough that in producing the antecedent event or condition the first man was actuated by the desire that the second should be led to do the prohibited act. The provision should be understood as opening up a less indefinite inquiry into the sequence of anterior events to which the forbidden result may be ascribed. It should be interpreted as confined to cases where the prohibited act is done on the actual authority, express or implied, of the party said to have caused it or in consequence of his exerting some capacity which he possesses in fact or law to control or influence the acts of the other. He must moreover contemplate or desire that the prohibited act will ensue.” 
        
       
        
      
    15 His Honour then went on:  
     
      
       
        
         
        In Lovelace v Director of Public Prosecutions [1954] 1 WLR 1468; [1954] 3 All ER 481, Lord Goddard CJ, with whom the other two members of Queen's Bench Division comprising the court agreed, said (at 1471; 483) that: “… the fact is that if a man is charged with causing or permitting something, it follows that that must result by reason of some act of his which is equivalent to causing, such as a command or direction to do the act.” In Clark v Hunter 1956 SLT 188, Lord Russell (at 191) said that “the word ‘causes’ appears to me to involve the person possessing some degree of control or authority to order or direct the use by another, and the giving of such an order or direction”. 
        
       
      
    16 Yeldham J quashed a conviction in the Local Court on the basis that the plaintiff had no such authority or control over the person to whom it was alleged he had caused to supply drugs to him. 
     
      
    17 There are other decisions that have come to the same conclusion: see Shave v Rosner [1954] 2 All ER 280; Attorney General of Hong Kong v Tse Hung-lit [1986] 3 All ER 173. They require that the person be in a position of authority or control over the person who is being caused to commit an act. Of course the interpretation of the words of a statutory provision will be determined on the subject matter of the provision and I have found no decision dealing with causing drugs to be taken. However the cases confirm the view that I would have formed at any rate from the judgment of Yeldham J that the words ""cause another person to take"" in s 39(1)A require that the accused be in a position of authority or power over the person who takes the drug. 
     
      
    18 The offence is concerned with a person who administers to another, that is a person who directly gives the other person a drug, or causes another person to take the drug; that is a person who uses his authority over the other person to require that person to consume the drug. 
     
      
    19 There is no suggestion here that the accused administered the drug to Ms Brimble. It is quite the opposite. The facts indicate that Ms Brimble took the drug willingly, having had a dose poured for her by the accused. The question is, therefore, whether on the facts being relied upon by the Crown to support the charge, the accused caused Ms Brimble to take the drug. 
     
      
    20 The following paragraphs appear in the Agreed Statement of Facts: 
     
      
       
        
        “13. Whilst in the cabin Mrs Brimble asked the Accused what he was doing. The Accused told Mrs Brimble that he was having some Fantasy. Mrs Brimble asked what it was and the Accused said it was like ecstasy but that it made you ten times hornier. Evidence of this exchange was given by Mr Kuchel. 
         
         
        14. The Accused consumed a dose of the drug by pouring it into the lid of a water bottle and poured a dose for Mrs Brimble which she consumed. Mrs Brimble's dose was also poured into a lid of a water bottle. 
         
         
        15. In making available the dose of GHB to Mrs Brimble and saying words that encouraged Mrs Brimble to consume the drug, the Accused caused Mrs Brimble to take the drug and was reckless as to injury that might be occasioned to Mrs Brimble given that: 
         
         
        a Mrs Brimble had consumed alcohol; 
         
         
        b Mrs Brimble had not consumed GHB before and 
         
         
        c the general effects of GHB.” 
        
       
      
    21 It should be noted that there was no evidence in the trial that the accused had any awareness of the general effects of GHB apart from those that he had experienced as a result of his own ingestion of the drug. 
     
      
    22 Those three paragraphs do not, in my view, support an allegation that the accused caused Ms Brimble to take the drug. He may have influenced her by answering questions that she asked him about the nature of the drug. He may have encouraged her by the reference to the fact that it would make her ten times hornier in the context that they were about to indulge in sexual intercourse. But the offence is not one of encouraging or inciting or influencing a person to take a poison, it is one of causing a person to take a poison. 
     
      
    23 The Crown sought to overcome this problem by indicating that it was enough that the accused influenced Ms Brimble to take the drug and made reference to one of the cases that I had earlier raised with him that referred to a person being in the position of influence over another. But there is a difference, in my view, between a person being in a position of influence over one person and a person influencing another person. They are two very different concepts. The accused was not in a position of influence over Ms Brimble. 
     
      
    24 In my view, the use of the words ""causes another person to take"" is to cover that situation where a person in authority over another, for example an adult over a child, orders, commands, or directs the child to take the drug and, therefore, brings about the consequences that the section covers. It must be an act of the accused that caused Ms Brimble to take the drug. In my view, there is no such act shown in the Agreed Statement of Facts and, as I understand it, there will be no further evidence to support the charge other than the Agreed Statement of Facts.  
     
      
    25 In my view, in accordance with Castle v Olen and other authorities, the offence is not made out simply because the accused may have offered the drug, with encouragement or influence, to Ms Brimble. It was her act in taking the drug and the accused did not cause her to take it. All the accused did was to answer her question so that she could make up her own mind whether she would consume the drug or not. Those answers might have had an effect upon her decision but it was her decision. 
     
      
    26 This has been an issue that no doubt concerned the jury on the last occasion. It is clear from the questions that the jury asked that they were satisfied that the accused had supplied her with GHB, they were satisfied that GHB was a dangerous drug but they were concerned as to whether or not the accused's act of supply substantially contributed to Ms Brimble's death. It is clear that at least more than one member of the jury had a doubt about that issue, and that is not hard to understand. Ms Brimble was a forty-four year old woman. There is no suggestion she was in the cabin other than of her own willingness to be there, to engage in consensual intercourse with the accused and that she took the opportunity, when it was presented to her, to take the drug. There is no doubt that some members of the jury were concerned whether the accused was responsible for the death of Ms Brimble in that factual situation, particularly, as he had told Ms Brimble all he knew about the drug. 
     
      
    27 That is a problem that, in my view, infects this current charge. It is a problem that the Crown may or may not have in respect of the charge of manslaughter but in my view the agreed facts do not support the offence under s 39 of the Crimes Act. More than that, although the facts state that the accused was reckless as to injury to Ms Brimble and although he is quite entitled to make that acknowledgment and to indicate that at the time that he provided Ms Brimble with the drug, he foresaw the possibility that Ms Brimble might be injured, when I asked counsel appearing for the accused what that injury was, counsel could not indicate what the injury was that the accused foresaw at that time. It is not difficult to see why counsel has this problem because Mr Wilhelm was himself taking the drug. It is highly unlikely that he would have foreseen harm to Ms Brimble from a drug that he himself was prepared to take on that night and had taken on previous occasions without any ill-effects. 
     
      
    28 However, that is not the reason why I will allow the accused to withdraw his plea. If he had not made this application, I would have rejected the plea in any event. The facts do not make out the offence under s 39 and therefore I cannot permit the accused to plead guilty to an offence he has not committed. 
     
      
    29 The application is allowed and the accused is permitted to withdraw the plea to the second count on the indictment.

     JUDGMENT 
     1. In 2006 Angus O’Casey was the victim of a serious assault to his head resulting in skull fractures and damage to his auditory canal and significant psychological problems. On the basis of those injuries O’Casey received $37,000 by way of a victim injuries compensation payment in late October 2008.2. Some of the money he used to repay debts to his mother and for various doctors’ reports. He bought a PlayStation and other items. He spent monies on himself and others. It is likely he bought a new mobile phone in early December of 2008 and he spent $12,000 purchasing 900 ecstasy tablets for the purpose of selling them in Alice Springs. He said he was wanting forty or fifty dollars for each tablet.3. On 16 December he was travelling west along the Stuart Highway to Balranald at a speed of ten kilometres over the posted speed limit. He was a passenger. The car was pulled over by police and as events turned out the car was searched. 700 of those 900 tablets were found. He and his mates had used 200 of the tablets the previous weekend.4. How he was planning to get from Balranald to Alice Springs having come, as I understand it, from the Gosford region is moot. The ecstasy tablets weighed in at 175 grams thereby constituting a commercial quantity. He was arrested and charged with supply commercial quantity of ecstasy, an offence that carries a maximum penalty of twenty years imprisonment and, for a case falling in the middle of the range of objective seriousness, a standard non-parole period of ten years. At the time of the offence Angus O’Casey was eighteen years and three months.5. Today he is to be held accountable for his criminal conduct. He asks that I take his possession of twenty-two grams of cannabis into account when sentencing him on a Form 1 although no Form 1 has yet been handed up.6. As sentencing judge it falls to me to resolve a number of competing tensions as I strive to determine the appropriate sentence for this offence before this court committed by this offender harming or potentially harming the community to which he was heading.7. My initial task requires an assessment of the objective criminality of the offence before the court. I will also need to have regard to matters personal to him called subjective matters. The starting point for these assessments requires me to make findings of fact from the evidence before the court relating to the offence and to the offender.8. My fact finding task has been circumscribed in that an agreed set of facts has been tendered to which I shall shortly return. It is sufficient at this point that I remind the court a judge is not a party to the agreed set of facts. The tender of agreed facts does not relieve the sentencing judge from his or her fact finding responsibility. It simply limits the material from which facts may be found. To the extent if it be the case that the facts as agreed do not reflect the actual events that occurred it must be remembered a court can only find facts from the evidence placed before it.9. The offender’s rehabilitation prospects will have to be assessed even if looking through a glass darkly. Before any sentence can be made there are likely to be technical questions relating to deterrence, discounts, whether special circumstances are to be found, the Form 1 matter I have referred to, whether this offence does in fact attract a standard non-parole period and the length of the parole period, and finally, of course, the ultimate length of the term of imprisonment to be imposed.10 None of those things can be commenced until the primary facts are determined. What weight needs to be given to all of these matters against an imperative that sentencing should have as its primary focus the protection of the community will also need to be determined, see R v Cuthbert [1967] 2 NSWR 329, R v Rushby [1977] 1 NSWLR 597 and R v Hayes [1984] 1 NSWLR 740.Facts11. The vehicle was pulled over some seventy-five kilometres east of Balranald. It was stopped so that police could conduct a mobile random breath tests. The driver of the vehicle indicated negative to alcohol. The offender was seated in the front passenger seat of the vehicle. As a result of inquiries at the scene police executed a police power to search the vehicle. In the boot of the vehicle police located a black backpack. Inside that backpack police located a small plastic releasable bag containing cannabis leaf.12. Further search revealed a glass bong and a metal bowl containing a small amount of loose cannabis leaf. The offender immediately informed police that the cannabis and bong located belonged to him.13. In a blue backpack also belonging to the offender and located in the boot of the vehicle police located a clear plastic resealable bag containing a large amount of Australian currency. Upon further search of the blue backpack police located two small plastic resealable bags containing a number ecstasy tablets. The offender told police, “The cash is mine from a compo payout and the ecstasy tablets are mine for personal use”.14. Further in the boot of the vehicle police located a brown plastic shopping bag containing a large number of small empty resealable plastic bags. Police continued to search the vehicle and found a yellow torch behind the driver’s seat. When opened, police located a clear plastic resealable bag containing a number of other plastic resealable bags which in turn contained ecstasy tablets.15. O’Casey told police, “They are mine as well and I wasn’t going to tell you they were there”. He was arrested and taken back to Hay Police Station and placed in police custody.16. The drugs were weighed by police in the presence of the offender and his money counted. The cannabis leaf in the small plastic resealable bag weighed in at 22.3 grams and the loose cannabis leaf weighed in at half a gram. The total weight therefore of the cannabis leaf was 22.8 grams.17. The two small plastic resealable bags located in the black backpack weighed in at 19.2 grams.18. The clear plastic resealable bag from inside the yellow torch was removed and it contained a further twelve resealable bags each containing tablets. They were tested by DAL, analytical laboratories, and found to be 3/4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine. The total quantity of the tablets found was 175 grams.19. The cash from the blue backpack was counted in front of the offender and it amounted to $5,390 Australian currency in varying denominations.20. Despite the comments made by the offender to police while the vehicle was being searched, the Crown accepts the plea of guilty on the basis that the offender had the ecstasy tablets in his possession for the purposes of supply, a proposition that appears to have been agreed to by the offender when giving evidence.21. Although there is no evidence before me of prior drug dealing as best I can discern from the material before me in thirty-six SMS messages which had been captured on his new mobile phone between the fifth and 14 December, he appears to have been involved in something less than half a dozen deals, at least two of which appear to have been related to the supply of cannabis and all his dealing to apparent end users.22. I can identify beyond reasonable doubt two customers, one of whom appears to owe him some $700. His purchase of the ecstasy tablets was a step intended to elevate him from a small time supplier to known friends or associates to a mid level supplier to persons he did not necessarily know or have any other basis for contact with them.23. On the evidence before me there is a reasonable possibility the cash found by police is as he describes it, is cash he was able to withdraw from a bank account because of his victim injury compensation. It is not unreasonable to infer he took it as part of a bankroll for the further purchase of drugs or for a larger purchase of drugs than he originally made or as a bankroll for the trip he was then embarked upon.Objective Criminality24. From the facts as he finds them to be a sentencing judge is required to assess the objective criminality of the offence as an essential step in assessing the seriousness of the criminal behaviour of the offender. That is done by comparing objectively the criminality exhibited in the instant case with criminality of offences of a similar kind. It is in this way that the objective seriousness of the criminality of this offence can be evaluated. The objective criminality has an important, indeed in this case, the vital impact upon the overall sentencing outcome.25. Courts and the legislature, that is, parliament, have made it clear that drug supplying, that is, the supplying of illegal drugs, is an unacceptable criminal activity. It is not difficult to understand why drug supplying is a criminal activity. Contrary to the impression this offender may well have entertained, it is not a social. but rather antisocial, behaviour.26. Courts have long recognised that in assessing the objective seriousness of a drug offence it is necessary to have regard to the actual harm done by the drug or in this case the drug’s potential for harm, see Drug Law in New South Wales 2nd ed, Zahra et al.27. Harm to others when inflicted by someone else is antisocial. Drug dealing has as its core an attack upon the health of members of the public. For his $12,000 investment O’Casey was seeking a profit ranging from $16,000 to $23,000 on his investment. He had sufficient quantities to supply to those who would in turn on-supply to others.28. Ecstasy, at least from my experience where I sit, seems to be sold to individual users in lots ranging from single tablet through to twenty or twenty-five tablets. Thus a working potential for the number of discrete deals appears to range from somewhere between twenty-eight and 140 deals. In Lozanovski v The Queen [2009] NSWCCA 123, Adams J with whom McClellan CJ at CL and James J agreed, noted: 
     
      
      “Although the amount of drugs supplied is far from the only factor to be considered when assessing the objective seriousness, yet it is in most cases the most significant factor since it measures at once the scale of the dealing itself which is at the very centre of the offence but also the risk to society that dealing in such quantities entails”. 
       
       
      
    29. Ecstasy is addictive. The user’s intent may be to one of seeking a relaxed, upbeat mood and seeking social confidence. Ecstasy however is well known for its long lasting negative impacts. These will build up the more the ecstasy is used. Those negative impacts include confusion, sleep deprivation, anxiety, paranoia, depression, aggression, brain damage including impaired memory, chills and sweating. Significantly many of those complaints are complaints reported to Dr Lennings by this offender.30. While the amount of ecstasy he had to supply as he intended would not have caused any of these symptoms in those using the tablets to a point of illness, what would have happened is they would have contributed to the health deterioration or further health deterioration of numerous unknown users.31. Treating drug addicts and conditions, particularly mental health conditions, caused by drug abuse is costing this nation many hundred of million dollars annually. If the effects of drug abuse is not the major health problem of the nation, it is certainly one of them.32. This offender was seeking to move to a middle level of drug dealing. As such his potential to contribute to the public health problem rose proportionally from his earlier dealings. He says he did not turn his mind to detection. That cannot be so. In order to conceal them he placed a large number of the ecstasy tablets in the shell of his large yellow torch. That can only be because he was seeking to minimise risk.33. At the time of this offence he was bailed in the Local Court upon a charge of breaking, entering and stealing. That bail was, by the time of this offence, only one month old. His commission of this offence, whilst being allowed at large on bail, must aggravate the seriousness of this charge before me. That is because he has breached an understanding that he would be of good behaviour to the court which granted him bail.34. The Crown argued the objective seriousness of the offence fell within the mid range of seriousness. That cannot be so. The quantity of ecstasy subject of this charge is in the lower quadrant of the range between 150 and 500 grams. Indeed, it is only twenty-five grams above the threshold.35. The basis of the charge is in possession for the purposes of supply, that is, that the potential for harm was real and on that basis punishable, for example, such in driving in a manner dangerous where the potential danger to the public is the nub of the offence. But that potential had not been realised as it may have been had the actual supplies been consummated.36. I made the point earlier that the likely consequence of supply of this quantity as planned was contribution to harm or further harm rather than causing measurable harm. Even that contribution to harm did not occur.37. The background against which the offence is to be evaluated is that of a small time dealer taking the opportunity provided by access to substantial cash to step up his level of drug dealing. He was aiming to deal in Alice Springs. That is to say, there were still a number of days before supply for financial gain was to be undertaken. Again, that puts his criminality less than somebody whose background has been that of a full time middle level dealer who returned immediately to his established market with his product.38. This background does not reflect the same level of criminality as a mid level supplier of some standing replenishing his supplies and being caught. Nonetheless this offender’s intent was clear and firmly held. There does not appear to have been any ambiguity or ambivalence about it.39. I would assess this offence, bearing in mind it is a charge of supply a commercial quantity of ecstasy as falling in the bottom quadrant of seriousness for those kind of offences, but towards the top of that quadrant.Subjective Matters40. I turn now to the subjective factors. I am both entitled and required to do that. Not only am I sentencing for this criminal offence but I am also sentencing this offender for it. Each offender coming before the court varies from others who stand or who have stood for sentence.41. Circumstances personal to Angus O’Casey may offer to the court some explanation and insight into the commission of this offence by him or some reason why a more or a less sentencing outcome is appropriate.Family, Relationships and Background42. At the time of the offending Angus O’Casey was a single man aged eighteen years and three months. He is as best I can tell the oldest of three siblings. He says he has reasonable relations with his younger brother and a sister. His parents separated when he was two. The father has maintained contact but is described as abusive towards this son. The son seeks to minimise that abuse in his reports of his father.43. His mother, Mrs O’Casey, reports some long term defacto relationships after the separation and one of those partners apparently was also abusive towards the offender.44. I sense there were behavioural problems through adolescence which are being minimised as “adjustment issues” in one of the reports before me.Education, Training and Experience45. Angus O’Casey’s present income stream is a disability pension. He was somewhat hyperactive at school and had some hearing problems which may have had some impact upon his capacity to receive information in a classroom. He left school in Year 8. Frequent family movement must have resulted in some instability in his educational settings. There was problematic behaviour, at least towards the end.46. He told Dr Lennings he saw himself as a protector of the weak. While I accept that may have been true for him at school, it is clearly a principle he has now abandoned because his intention was to prey upon the weak, the drug addicts and the drug users and make money out of their addictions.47. Having left school he continued at TAFE. He completed Year 9 but not Year 10. He then shifted to studying various vocational streams initially Engineering Certificate II passing only two out of the eight subjects and withdrawing from most. He had more success with a Certificate for Foundational and Vocational Attainment passing seven out of the ten.48. Then he moved to Hospitality II, obtaining a pass only in food handling. He obtained an Occupational Health and Safety Certificate for general construction work. At nineteen he is still needing some direction and time to sort out a career path.49. His strongest interests at school were sport and mathematics, but from the evidence before me he does not appear to have persisted in either. He has a long history of unemployment with a few days as a labourer in 2008 and in the past week.50. Post-injury he sought employment through an employment agency but his behavioural problems impeded progress.General Health51. He presents as a fit young nineteen year old. There is a hearing problem I earlier referred to. Whether that has resolved itself or was exacerbated by the injury is unclear. Nor is there any history of it being treated or addressed. There apparently has been some damage occasioned to the auditory bone. He reports a dizziness with postural change which may be related either to blood pressure or to those parts of the ear that relate to balance.Mental Health52. Dr Lennings diagnosed a post-traumatic stress disorder falling into the mild clinical range which Dr Lennings thought was elevated beyond a degree he would have anticipated from a young person with a history of chronic oppositional behaviour, that is, somebody who was used to getting into trouble quite a lot.53. Dr Lennings regarded O’Casey’s level of high anger as his most serious psychological problem. That assessment was made two years after the assault. Whether it has abated in the last two years is not disclosed. The doctor assumed the anger arose from the assault upon him by the three youths. I do not rule out the anger having its origins in causes long before the assaults. The pre-assault oppositional behaviour suggests that may be so.54. Dr Lennings saw him being “locked into being an angry and bitter young person if unable to process his difficulties”. There is a remarkable nonchalance exhibited by this offender in tending to his problems, although he has seen a usefulness in relying upon them at sentence.55. There is also some claimed cognitive deficits but these must be assessed against his IQ and pre-existing problems. While his mother regarded him as having a high IQ in his younger years that assessment may have been made upon the basis of his then development as against his youth or his young child status.56. In any event, his current IQ has been assessed as quite low being at the bottom of the average end or at the top of the low average range. He has excellent non-verbal skills falling into the above average range.57. Angus O’Casey’s cognitive assessments as tested by Dr Lennings revealed mixed signs. It was not inconsistent with poor educational adjustment and/or subclinical ADHD. It may also have been reflective of injury or intrusion into the cognitive system based upon anxiety. 58. Testing confirmed obsessional attitudes, paranoia, intense suspiciousness and anxiety. Dr Lennings described him as “a disturbed and psychologically vulnerable young man who is in need of urgent treatment”. He noted that delay in treating him for the original injury has led to some embedding of maladaptive psychological responses.59. The offender is concerned that he has had impaired memory and difficulty finding the precise word he wants since the assault upon him. He reports that his thought processes have been slowed and “thinking in a fog or feeling confused”. Dr Lennings’ assessment was that Angus O’Casey’s functions were “more or less within acceptable limits”, although there was a verbal/non-verbal discrepancy. He thought many of the problems were driven by anxiety. It was Dr Lennings’ opinion that the psychologic rather than the neurological sequelae of the assaults causes most harm to the offender.60. Of real worry with the high level of anger is the noted impaired executive function of the brain. Contained within the executive functioning is the function of judgment. Judgment or impaired judgment and a high level of anger suggests further trouble to come if it is not addressed and treated.Drug and Alcohol Issues61. He had been using cannabis prior to his head injury. Since the head injury his usage increased to ten cones daily. He was abusing ecstasy. He gives as an example he and his mates consuming 200 tablets, if I have understood the evidence, over a weekend.62. He claims only occasional binge drinking. His evidence was that at the time of the offending he was using five to ten tablets per day and double that on weekends.63. As I said earlier many of the symptoms he claims are consistent with the side effects of the drugs he has been abusing. He claims either restricted use or no use since his arrest on this charge.Character and Criminal History64. Angus O’Casey comes to sentence a young man with a history of oppositional behavioural issues that saw him in trouble at home and at school but significantly not before the courts. This was his second major offending conduct. It is of concern that it occurs a month after a break, enter and steal offence.65. He has been assessed as having a disability presumably arising from his mental health issues. He appears to have made a good effort to obtain vocational training at TAFE.Attitude to the Offence66. Angus O’Casey has no understanding of the public health issues relating to drug abuse or how his intended sales of ecstasy may have contributed to them. Nor does he understand his own symptoms of anxiety, confusion, anger and aggression may be sustained or aggravated by his personal abuse of drugs. It seems to me he is putting all that down to the effects of the attack upon him. I suspect his attitude to this offence is formulated by this. 67. He well understands the law regards what he did as an offence and a serious offence and that it is being dealt with in the District Court where the range of penalties is greater than the lower court. He certainly regrets being caught with the drugs.68. He understands the stress and anxiety it has caused his mother and family and no doubt himself. And I genuinely believe he is minded not to re-offend for those more concrete reasons than the other. Frankly he may be a concrete thinker and may not be able to come to an understanding of the real basis of criminality of drug dealing.Early Plea69. This plea was entered on the day this offender’s trial was listed as a second trial in the criminal list at the Griffith District Court at its last sittings. One of the disadvantages that occurs in circuit courts is that the various legal representatives are not in daily contact with each other in the weeks or months leading up to the next sittings of a District Court. While I accept that measured against city centres the utilitarian value of a plea at committal or on arraignment is greater, this is another instance of a system working against those in remote and regional areas. I must, however, assess the real utilitarian value and against that I intend to give a fifteen per cent discount for the plea.Rehabilitation Prospects70. This offender’s rehabilitation prospects are clouded. As I said but a moment ago I do believe he genuinely intends not to re-offend. He enjoys the strong support of his mother and says that he gets on well with his younger siblings. Family support is crucial to rehabilitation.71. He appears since leaving school to have made genuine efforts to advance his education in vocational training areas but his present income stream is a disability pension and one week of labouring work.72. As best one can tell he has reasonable physical health although if he still has a hearing problem it may be contributing to some of his issues. On the other hand his psychological profile is far from supportive. But worse, he has done nothing to treat it in the past two years and his drug taking could only have exacerbated it. The conduct bringing him before the court is an example of his willingness to take risks, that is, an example of his poor execution of judgment.73. His commission of the break and enter offence a month before demonstrates the same character flaw. His executive functioning including judgment is impaired. He claims to have cut back on his use of drugs but there is no forensic evidence to support that. The Crown has not disputed his claim. I am cautious in accepting it, and when I do accept it I cannot know entirely what motivates it, that is, whether it is the sentence hanging over his head or a genuine desire to abandon drugs.74. He is not likely to purchase $12,000 worth of ecstasy tablets and to seek to trade at that level. But my sense is that is in part because he has exhausted the compensation funds he received rather than any conversion from drug abuse or understanding of the public health harm drug dealers create.Setting the Sentence75. I acknowledge a drug supply offence is one calling for strong weighting of general deterrence. I have already noted that the maximum penalty for this offence is one of twenty years imprisonment with a standard non-parole period for an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for offences in the standard non-parole period table.76. Should the standard non-parole period apply? I have found this offence falls below the middle of the range of objective seriousness. For that reason the standard non-parole period does not apply but when setting the sentence I must remember it still has work to do. In considering the residual impact the standard non-parole period should have on this sentence I note that even had the offence fallen in the middle of the range there are other reasons why a standard non-parole would not have applied. These reasons must be found in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. Section 21A(1) requires the court in determining an appropriate sentence for a mid range offence to take into account: 
     
      
      (a) aggravating factors referred to in s 21A(2); 
       
      (b) mitigating factors referred to in s 21A(3); 
       
      (c) and/or objective or other subjective factors that affect the relative seriousness of the offence. 
      
    77. Under aggravating factors I have already taken into account 21A(2)(j) that O’Casey was on bail.78. Mitigating factors include 21A(3)(a), loss, injury, emotional harm caused by this offence was not substantial. Although there was a real potential for harming public health it did not eventuate; 
     
      
      (e) the offender does not have any significant record for past offending; 
       
      (j) the offender was not fully aware of the potential consequences of his action because of his age, modest intellectual capacity and concrete thinking patterns. 
      
    79. 21A(3)(k), a guilty plea by the offender but that; of course has been addressed.80. Finally I am satisfied of a line of authority endorsed by Hearne’s case (R v Hearne (2007) 124 AcrR 457) case supports a finding of special circumstances in cases where young offenders are to be incarcerated but given parole based upon the weight to be given in such cases to the need for rehabilitation.81. Thus where there are multiple compelling reasons to give a lesser parole period than the standard non-parole the weight to be given to the residual effect of the provisions of s 54B of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 must become more muted than would be the case if there was only, say, a plea of guilty.82. R v Clarke unreported NSWCCA 15 3 90 does it apply? In this case police intervention as a consequence of police search resulted the seizure of 700 ecstasy tablets on the road between Balranald and Hay. I have noted the original purchase was 900 tablets, 200 of which were consumed by the accused and his mates over the weekend prior to his arrest. They are uncharged, but form the backdrop of his circumstances when arrested.83. There is no evidence the distribution of those tablets was for financial gain or even for any money. The Crown has not established on the facts before me the money found on the accused was from the sale of drugs. Clarke’s case establishes: 
     
      
      “The policy laid down by the Court of Criminal Appeal, that only in exceptional circumstances will a non-custodial sentence be appropriate for drug traffickers, is not restricted to those cases in which it has been demonstrated that a profit has been obtained. That policy is principally directed to the trafficking, the dissemination of drugs to others. The position is worse when there has been a profitable commercial exploitation but trafficking alone in any substantial degree should normally lead to a custodial sentence” (head note). 
       
      
    84. Also of importance coming out of the same case, and perhaps to the same effect, are the following: 
     
      
      “This court has, on occasions too numerous to mention, emphasised that sentences involving a substantial general deterrence are to be imposed on drug traffickers and it is indicated that only in exceptional circumstances will a non-custodial order be appropriate...” 
       
      
    85. What the statement is principally directed to is the trafficking- the dissemination of drugs to others. That is made clear by Street CJ in Hayes’ case at 457.86. While I accept it was certainly O’Casey’s intention to traffic with these drugs, that is, to disseminate them to others, in the unusual circumstances of this case he did not do so in respect of the 700 tablets he has been charged with. There was an earlier distribution of 200 tablets among himself and others on the weekend. That certainly constitutes the start of the dissemination but it is a question of degree.87. I am prepared to find there was, in the circumstances of this case, no dissemination or trafficking of the drugs subject to the charge to or in any substantial degree, although as I earlier found he was stepping up to become a mid level drug supplier. Because of his possession of more than a trafficable quantity for the purpose of supply he must obviously be regarded as supplying. But this offence does not reach the seriousness of trafficking in, or disseminating, 700 tablets among the community or even to undercover police operatives as is so often the case.Setting the Sentence88. I reviewed the JIRS statistics for supplying a commercial quantity of amphetamines both pre standard non-parole period and post standard non-parole. Ninety-two and ninety-four per cent respectively of all offenders are subject to full time imprisonment. This offender does not fall into this extraordinary category of six per cent who have been able to avoid full time incarceration.89. Prior to the standard non-parole impacting on sentence the imprisonment range for full sentences ranged from eighteen months to seven years with forty-six per cent receiving sentences of three and a half years or less. Post the standard non-parole period impacting upon sentences the full range has now climbed from two and a half years to twelve years with forty per cent receiving five years imprisonment or less.90. Prior to the standard non-parole period, the non-parole periods ranged from six months to four years with fifty-two per cent receiving a standard non-parole period of two years or less. Since the standard non-parole has come into force only nineteen per cent of imprisoned offenders receive a standard non-parole period of two years or less. Forty-eight per cent of imprisoned offenders receive a standard non-parole period of three years or less.91. The objective seriousness of the offence I am dealing with, having 700 ecstasy tablets for supply, is so serious that a full time custodial sentence is called for. This offender has a strong subjective case but even so custody is nonetheless required. The observations of the professionals that he be treated urgently should not be ignored. A copy of these remarks should be sent to Justice Health together with a copy of the defence forensic reports outlining the health issues.92. I have been concerned that full time custody will stand in the way of needed recommended treatment but little has been done to advance that treatment in the past two years nor, it seems to me as a matter of law, can needed treatment be a basis, at least in this case, for avoiding the inevitable.The Form 1 Matter93. The Form 1 matter relates to possession of less than an indictable quantity of cannabis. Frankly, if it had been dealt with before the Local Court the offender would likely have been fined. It will be taken into account but its impact on the overall sentence will be minimal.94. My initial assessment of the objective seriousness put this matter in the lowest quadrant of seriousness for commercial supply. The subjective case I have classified as strong. The standard non-parole period impact is more muted than it otherwise might have been because of the youth, abstinence of actual harm and minimal criminal record in addition to the plea of guilty. I have distinguished Clarke’s case.95. But for the plea of guilty I would have set an overall sentence of three and a half years. That figure can be discounted by fifteen per cent which amounts on my calculation to a six month discount. Thus, the overall sentence is to be one of three years imprisonment.96. I find special circumstances namely the need for rehabilitation to be undertaken in the community, the treatment of psychological issues needs to be undertaken in the community, the need to enforce illicit drug abstention needs to be undertaken in the community.97. I come now to the formal sentencing but before I do that, do we have a Form 1?[Discussion between His Honour and legal representatives]98. Angus Bartholomew O’Casey, you are convicted that you on 16 December 2008 at Hay in the State of New South Wales did supply an amount of prohibited drug to wit 175 grams of 3/4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine more commonly known as ecstasy being an amount which was not less than the commercial quantity applicable to that prohibited drug.99. I sentence you to a non-parole period of fifteen months to date from 12 April 2010 and to expire on 11 July 2011. I set a balance of term to make up the three years to expire on 11 April 2013. I order your release to parole on 11 July 2011. Pursuant to s 52 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999, I order that you be supervised by Probation and Parole.100. I require as conditions of your supervision that you accept drug and alcohol counselling, that you submit yourself to random drug screening four times monthly for the balance of your parole and you are to undertake psychological treatment as agreed between you and the Probation and Parole Service.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GROVE J: I have had the advantage of reading, in draft form, the respective judgments of Simpson J and RA Hulme J. As, like the latter, I agree with the order proposed by Simpson J I will limit the matters to which I advert or upon which I comment.  
     
      
    2 It is not necessary to repeat the facts and circumstances, the statements of which I gratefully adopt from the judgment of Simpson J. However, even giving generous weight to factors favourable to the respondent, I would consider the combination of the objective gravity of the indicted offence, the need to reflect the criminality in the offences scheduled in the Form 1 and the subjective matters unfavourable to the respondent including his prior criminal record, generally and for offences of a like nature, his failure to respond appropriately to significant leniency previously received and the currency of a bond to be of good behaviour, leads to an assessment of the sentence as manifestly inadequate. I would so conclude. 
     
      
    3 In reaching that conclusion, I have taken into account the non-custodial consequence of the order for suspension and, in that sense, “a wrong type” of sentence is considered to have been imposed: see Dinsdale v The Queen (2000) 202 CLR 321 at 325. 
     
      
    4 Reference has been made to the opinion of Simpson J in R v Thai [2009] NSWCCA 314 concerning the primary focus upon the length of sentence and not, in that case, upon an order that it be served by periodic detention. McClellan CJ at CL, with particular reference to s 6(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, opined that consideration of all elements including the manner in which a sentence is to be served was appropriate (when determining of a sentence is manifestly inadequate or excessive). The third member of the Court (Hidden J) found it unnecessary to express a view. 
     
      
    5 Neither is it necessary in the present appeal to seek to resolve any apparent controversy between the views mentioned and, to the extent that Simpson J has reiterated that which she expressed in Thai, I would record that I reserve my opinion, particularly as submissions upon the matter were not made in this appeal. 
     
      
    6 Like RA Hulme J, I am struck by the possibly serendipitous consequence that a “discount” from an (unstated) assessment of sentence should produce the maximum term in respect of which an order for suspension is permissible. I agree with what he has written. 
     
      
    7 Although I differ from Simpson J in finding manifest inadequacy, this Court retains a discretion to decline to intervene subject to the restrictions legislated by s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 as explained in R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49. I share the reasons of Simpson J for exercising that discretion in this case. 
     
      
    8 As above stated, I agree with the order proposed by Simpson J. 
     
      
    9 SIMPSON J: This is a Crown appeal against what is asserted to be the manifest inadequacy of a sentence imposed upon the respondent in the District Court on 14 August 2009, following his plea of guilty to a single charge of conspiracy to cheat and defraud. In addition, pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Procedure Act”), the respondent asked that seven further offences (five of having custody of a false instrument, and two of using a false instrument) listed on a Form 1, be taken into account. 
     
      
    10 The offence of conspiracy to cheat and defraud is a common law misdemeanour, subject to no statutory maximum penalty. Sentencing is “at large”. The sentencing judge imposed a sentence of imprisonment for 2 years. Pursuant to s 12 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, he ordered that execution of the sentence be suspended conditional upon the respondent entering into a good behaviour bond commencing on 14 August 2009. It will be noted that he specified no non-parole period. 
     
      
       
      The facts 
       
      
    11 An agreed statement of facts was put before the sentencing judge. 
     
      
    12 The offence was committed over a period between 1 September and 6 October 2006. In short, the respondent became involved in a conspiracy to defraud a finance company of $800,000. This was to be achieved by means of a fraudulent loan application. One participant was a man called Anwer Wanna. He, it seems, was the participant who was to pose as the loan applicant. Another participant was Meng Wang. Two other participants were mentioned in the statement of facts, named only as “Alex” and “Steve”.  
     
      
    13 For his part, Wanna was to receive a (unspecified) daily allowance, plus a lump sum of between $40,000 and $80,000. 
     
      
    14 The respondent’s role was to arrange for the manufacture of a fraudulent driver’s licence, and a fraudulent Medicare card both in the same name. This was the name of a real person, who was entirely unaware that his personal details were being appropriated. The driver’s licence contained a photograph of Wanna. Using the false driver’s licence and Medicare card Wanna and Wang opened various accounts with a number of banks. The respondent assisted Wanna in preparing the false documentation for these accounts. He also coached Wanna on what to say and how to present himself when dealing with the finance company; he went to the extent of preparing a script for Wanna to follow. 
     
      
    15 On 4 October a loan application in the amount of $780,000 was submitted to a financial institution, in the same name as that used in the false documents, and accompanied by false documents. It attracted the suspicion of the financial institution employee who dealt with it, who sought legal advice, referred the matter to police, and contacted the person whose identity had been used to create the false documentation. 
     
      
    16 The financial institution employee arranged for Wanna to attend at the office of the financial institution’s solicitors on 6 October, purportedly in order to complete the loan application documentation. Police were in attendance and Wanna was arrested. He was in possession of a number of fraudulent identity documents and credit cards, all bearing the same name. They had been supplied to him by the respondent.  
     
      
    17 Wanna told police that the respondent was the organiser of the enterprise. 
     
      
    18 The respondent had been under suspicion at least since 26 September and he was under surveillance and his telephone monitored. The summaries of his telephone contacts contained in the agreed statement of facts tends to support Wanna’s account that the respondent had an organising role in the conspiracy. For example, on occasions he coached Wanna on what to say and how to present himself when attending at the finance company to complete the documentation for the loan application. 
     
      
    19 The respondent was arrested on 10 October and was then charged with the Form 1 offences, but not with the substantive offence. He was granted bail. In his possession were two false credit cards, in a different false name. The respondent falsely told police that they belonged to a friend of his and were in his possession because he owed money.20 On execution of a search warrant at an office used by the respondent, police located a false NSW driver’s licence and a false Medicare card, both in yet another name. Possession of these together with the two credit cards, account for four of the custody of false instrument offences on the Form 1. Subsequent inquiries revealed that, earlier on the day of his arrest, the respondent had used a false credit card to purchase Hong Kong dollars (the equivalent of AU$4000), and the Medicare card as identification. Later on the same day he opened a cash account in the same false name, depositing $19,800 in cash. These constitute the two offences of using a false instrument on the Form 1.  
     
      
    21 It was not until 11 January 2007 that the respondent was charged with the indictable offence of conspiracy. He remained in custody until 17 January when he was able to meet bail conditions imposed on 12 January. 
     
      
    22 Wanna and Wang (the latter of whom seems to have played a relatively minor part) each pleaded guilty in the Local Court to various offences. Wanna, who was charged with and pleaded guilty to six offences of possessing false instruments with intent to use them, was originally sentenced to imprisonment for 12 months with a non-parole period of 9 months. The sentence was reduced by reason of the plea (although the reduction was unquantified) and by 25 percent for promised assistance in the prosecution of the respondent. Wanna had been on parole at the time of the offences. He was 67 years of age and in poor health. On appeal to the District Court, the non-parole period was reduced to 6 months. 
     
      
    23 Wang pleaded guilty to two offences of the same kind, and was fined $200 and released on a Community Service Order (100 hours). 
     
      
    24 Following several days of committal proceedings, the indictable charge against the respondent was listed for trial in the District Court on 6 April 2009 – 2½ years after his arrest. On 9 April he entered a plea of guilty. (It does not appear that the trial actually commenced.) It was not until 14 August that he was finally sentenced – almost 3 years after arrest. The reason for the delay between plea and sentencing is not before this Court. From 17 January until the date of sentencing, the respondent was on conditional bail, reporting to police, initially daily, and, from 12 April 2007, three times weekly. 
     
      
       
      The proceedings on sentence 
       
      
    25 Before the sentencing judge were a Pre-Sentence Report prepared by an officer of the Probation and Parole Service, a report of Professor Stephen Woods, a psychologist, and also letters written by Ms Yinghua Liu (the respondent’s then fiancée, who also gave oral evidence), and by the respondent’s brother, mother and an employer. 
     
      
    26 The respondent did not give evidence. 
     
      
    27 As a result of that evidence, the sentencing judge found that the respondent had presented “a strong subjective case”. I turn now to that case. 
     
      
       
      The respondent’s personal circumstances 
       
      
    28 The respondent was born in May 1978, in China. He was therefore 28 years old at the time of the offences. His father migrated to Australia in 1986. The rest of the family joined him in 1991, when the respondent was 13 years old. The respondent has a brother, younger than he by five years. In Australia, the family was united, supportive and education/career orientated. However, his parents worked long hours, managing and owning restaurants, often leaving the children unsupervised. 
     
      
    29 The respondent experienced difficulties at school, and was suspended for truancy, as a result of which he terminated his formal education at the age of 17. He had employment of various kinds, and in 1999 opened a computer shop. His parents retired and he took over the management of three restaurants and a catering business that they had operated. 30 At the age of 13 he began gambling, and this developed, by the age of 16 into what was later termed (by Professor Woods) a pathological habit.  
     
      
    31 He has a criminal history that commenced in the Children’s Court in 1994 (when he was 16), and includes six offences of larceny, others of being in possession of goods reasonably suspected of being stolen, receiving, buying and selling second hand goods without a licence, and one of inciting the commission of a criminal offence. Most tellingly, for present purposes, in 2001 he was convicted on 10 counts of having a false instrument with intent to use it. There is no detail as to the nature or circumstances of these last offences. In respect of those (and others) he was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 months, to be served by way of home detention. However, only a month after that sentence was imposed, the State Parole Authority revoked the order that the sentence be served in that way, and the respondent served the balance of the term of 5 months in full-time custody. 
     
      
    32 Subsequently, in May 2002, he was convicted of another charge of receiving, in respect of which he was sentenced to imprisonment for 5 years with a non-parole period of 3 years. An appeal against the severity of the sentence was dismissed. His record shows that, in July 2005, a parole order was revoked and he was ordered to serve the balance of his term, of 13 months, in custody. In October 2005 he was convicted of reckless driving, and sentenced to imprisonment for 3 months. 
     
      
    33 Again significantly for present purposes, in October 2005 he was convicted of using a false instrument with intent, and with possession of a false instrument with intent to use it. On this occasion he was given the benefit of a 12 month bond under s 9 of the Sentencing Procedure Act, conditional upon his entering a residential rehabilitation programme. The bond was still current (although close to expiry) at the time of the present offences. 
     
      
    34 Both the author of the Pre-Sentence Report and Professor Woods accepted that the respondent’s criminality stemmed from his gambling addiction. Both also accepted that he had ceased the habit following his 2006 arrest. Professor Woods accepted that his behaviour satisfied the criteria for a diagnosis of pathological gambling, in remission from October 2006. 
     
      
    35 The Probation and Parole Service officer considered the respondent to be “intelligent and hardworking”. Professor Woods assessed him to be “of high average intelligence”. 
     
      
    36 Professor Woods considered him to be a low risk of offending; but to be at risk of “a clinically severe reaction (ie depression and anxiety)” when sentenced. This was because he further considered the respondent to be engaging in “active denial” (Professor Woods did not specify to what the denial related, but I am prepared to assume that that was the risk of incarceration). 
     
      
    37 As mentioned above, the respondent’s then fiancée, Ms Liu, gave oral evidence. She had known the respondent for about 4 years. The most significant aspect of her evidence concerned the respondent’s current work and personal situation. She said that, in 2007, he was successful in obtaining a catering contract at Mascot, and this involved his working 6 to 7 days per week. Since then, he has acquired several more catering contracts, at clubs and golf courses, and the business is progressing to the point that it employs 15 to 20 people, and is making a (modest) profit. 
     
      
    38 As a result, Ms Liu said, the respondent has gained confidence, and does not avoid contact with people as he previously had, and has given up gambling altogether. 
     
      
    39 She said that the respondent has taken on the sponsorship of two children in China as some sort of atonement. Finally, she said that she and he had jointly purchased a house over which there is a mortgage in the amount of $520,000. Although she works as an accountant, she would not be able, herself, to meet the repayments on the mortgage. 
     
      
      The remarks on sentence 
       
      
    40 In his carefully considered remarks on sentence, the sentencing judge began by outlining the facts. He recorded the sentences imposed upon the co-offenders, and noted that, because they were dealt with in the Local Court, principles of parity did not strictly apply. 
     
      
    41 He noted that the penalty for a common law misdemeanour is “at large”, but that, for sentencing purposes, regard could be had to the maximum penalty for an equivalent substantive offence (which he considered to be imprisonment for 5 to 10 years). Nevertheless, he accepted that the offence was “objectively a serious matter” (as it plainly was). He noted that, because the enterprise was intercepted, there was no actual loss of money, and no breach of trust involved. He acknowledged that the respondent was subject to a bond at the time of the offences, and that this had to be treated as an aggravating feature.  
     
      
    42 He found it difficult to identify the respondent’s role in the conspiracy. There was no evidence as to what he was to receive by way of remuneration. He was not satisfied that the respondent was “the prime instigator”. That was because the facts showed that other individuals, who had never been arrested or charged, were, on occasions, giving advice and instruction to the respondent. 
     
      
    43 In the course of assessing the objective seriousness of the conspiracy offence, he acknowledged that “identity fraud” (which this undoubtedly is) “cost[s] the community dearly”. Having said that, he added that this “does not appear to be the most sophisticated conspiracy to defraud”, as evidenced by its early detection. 
     
      
    44 He considered that the plea of guilty had “real utilitarian value” but recognised that, by reason of its timing, that value was limited; he allowed a reduction in sentence of 10 percent. 
     
      
    45 He declared himself impressed by the evidence of Ms Liu. He noted the Pre-Sentence and psychological reports. He considered relevant matters of aggravation and mitigation required to be taken into account by s 21A of the Sentencing Procedure Act. He accepted Professor Woods’ assessment that the respondent was unlikely to re-offend and therefore that he had good prospects of rehabilitation. He expressly considered the question of remorse, as governed by s 21A(3)(i) (as recently amended) of the Sentencing Procedure Act and, notwithstanding that the respondent did not give evidence, concluded (from the evidence of Ms Liu and the report of Professor Woods and the Pre-Sentence Report) that there was objective evidence that the respondent was remorseful, and he took that into account. 
     
      
    46 He gave special consideration to the delay between arrest and sentencing. He acknowledged that some of the delay was attributable to the respondent, but also noted that he was not originally charged with conspiracy to cheat and defraud, and said that “negotiations have taken some time”. The material before this Court does not disclose the course of events in this respect. According to the (undisputed) particulars before this Court, the conspiracy charge was laid as early as 11 January 2007. The judge considered that, as a result of the delay, three relevant matters arose. These were: 
     
      
       
      (i) the suspense or uncertainty in which the respondent had been left “following intervention by authorities following his arrest”; 
       
       
      (ii) the evidence of rehabilitation during that period; 
       
       
      (iii) the principles concerning sentencing for “a stale crime”: he referred to  
      R v Hathaway  
      [2005] NSWCCA 368.  
       
      
    47 He held that the respondent had shown “real progress on the road to rehabilitation” and that he could “truly” be said to be “at the crossroads”. In explication of this, he noted that the respondent’s catering business provided employment for up to 20 employees, that he had not re-offended since arrested, that he had strong family support, and that he had been on relatively strict bail for a long period. He then said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The real relevance of the rehabilitation in this case is that a full time custodial sentence is very likely to undo the good progress to date.” 
        
       
      
    48 He returned to a consideration of the sentences imposed on Wanna and Wang and said that the respondent played a more prominent role in these offences than Mr Wanna, but that Wanna had a more serious criminal history. (This last finding may have been unduly favourable to the respondent. Wanna’s criminal history was not before this Court, but both the magistrate and the District Court judge who heard the appeal commented on his record in terms that suggest it was “significant”. No issue was taken with the finding by North DCJ.) 
     
      
    49 He took into account the need for general and specific deterrence. 
     
      
    50 He then found that special circumstances pursuant to s 44(2) of the Sentencing Procedure Act existed (although, in the result, because he ordered that the sentence be suspended, he did not impose a non-parole period: Sentencing Procedure Act, s 12(3)). 
     
      
    51 He paid particular attention to s 3A of the Sentencing Procedure Act, which precludes the imposition of a sentence of imprisonment unless the court is satisfied that, having considered all possible alternatives, no penalty other than imprisonment is appropriate. He made a finding to that effect, and concluded that the appropriate sentence was of imprisonment for 2 years. (That was the sentence he imposed after allowing the reduction of 10 percent in recognition of the plea of guilty.) 
     
      
    52 In the result, it appears to me, two circumstances played a major part in his Honour’s determination to order that the sentence be suspended. These were the delay in bringing the respondent to sentence, and his substantial demonstrated rehabilitation. He concluded that the interests of the community would be better served by allowing the respondent’s rehabilitation to continue, and that a full-time custodial sentence was likely to undo “all the good progress” that had been made to the date of sentence. 
     
      
    53 He, accordingly, imposed the sentence that he had indicated he would, and ordered that its execution be suspended.  
     
      
       
      The Crown appeal 
       
      
    54 As I have indicated above, the Crown appeals on the ground that the sentence is manifestly inadequate. It contends that three errors can be identified that may account for the asserted manifest inadequacy. These are: 
     
      
       
      (i) the sentencing judge failed to give adequate regard to the need for general deterrence; 
       
       
      (ii) the sentencing judge gave too much weight to the respondent’s subjective circumstances and failed to impose a sentence that adequately reflects the objective criminality of the offence; 
       
       
      (iii) the sentencing judge failed to impose a sentence that reflected the offences taken into account pursuant to Pt 3 Div 3 of the  
      Sentencing Procedure Act 
      . 
       
      
    55 The Crown accepted and relied upon the sentencing judge’s characterisation of the principal offence as one of “identity fraud” and pointed to a decision of this Court (Stevens v R [2009] NSWCCA 260) on that subject, and in particular the judgment of Spigelman CJ. (That judgment post-dates sentencing of the respondent.) It is unnecessary to quote what his Honour said; he referred to the effects of identity crimes on victims, and on the community generally, and the costs associated therewith. He also referred to prevalence as a matter relevant to the selection of sentence. He emphasised the weight that must be given to general deterrence.  
     
      
    56 The Crown submission was, simply, that the suspended sentence of 2 years’ imprisonment would not operate as a deterrent to others considering embarking upon criminality of this kind. 
     
      
    57 Further, the Crown pointed to the respondent’s criminal history, including the fact that, at the time of the offence, he was subject to a good behaviour bond. 
     
      
    58 While not challenging his Honour’s refusal to find that the respondent was “the prime instigator” of the conspiracy, the Crown pointed to the evidence that the respondent recruited, trained, directed and instructed Wanna in performing his role. As I have said earlier, there was evidence to support a conclusion that the respondent was involved in the organisation of the scheme; that is not inconsistent with the sentencing judge’s inability to find that he was “the prime instigator”.  
     
      
    59 The Crown also argued that the sentence failed adequately to take into account the Form 1 offences which were, themselves, serious. 
     
      
       
      The response on behalf of the respondent 
       
      
    60 The submissions made on behalf of the respondent addressed each of the individual errors which the Crown theorised could be seen to be behind the sentence that resulted. Noting that the decision in Stevens had not been delivered at the time of sentence, senior counsel nevertheless argued that the sentencing judge had correctly anticipated the kind of matters there alluded to. He pointed out, however, that the judge had expressly found that the offence was not “the most sophisticated conspiracy to defraud” because it was detected by the finance institution at such an early stage, and that there was no actual loss of money and no breach of trust. I think it is correct that the sentencing remarks denote an appreciation of the approach taken by the Chief Justice in Stevens. 
     
      
    61 In R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17, Howie J outlined the steps to be taken in criminal sentencing: paras [26]-[30]. On behalf of the respondent it was submitted that these steps had been correctly followed. 
     
      
    62 Senior counsel then took issue with the Crown’s suggestion that the sentencing judge gave too much weight to subjective factors at the expense of a proper appreciation of the objective gravity of the offence. He also took issue with the suggestion that inadequate attention was given to the Form 1 offences.  
     
      
       
       * * * 
       
      
    63 One difficulty in the resolution of this appeal is this: the Crown never clearly identified whether its complaint concerned the length of the sentence, or the fact that the suspension order was made, or a combination of the two. The following appear in the Crown’s written submissions: 
     
      
       
        
        “12 … 
         
         
          
          (i) in imposing a wholly suspended sentence of 2 years imprisonment …”; 
          
         
         
        “20 A wholly suspended sentence of 2 years …”; 
         
         
        “21 It is evident that his Honour’s decision to wholly suspend the sentence of imprisonment was made as a result of the respondent’s subjective case.”; 
         
         
        “29 The sentencing judge erred in imposing a manifestly inadequate sentence in circumstances where a more severe sentence was warranted.” 
        
       
      
    64 A sentence may be manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate by reason of the mode by which it is to be served – in full-time custody, or by way of one of the more lenient alternatives (periodic detention, home detention or on suspension); it may be manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate by reason of the term of the sentence: Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321 at [6]. It may, of course, be manifestly excessive or manifestly inadequate for both reasons, or because the two in combination produce an unacceptable result. A sentence that is within the reasonably available range may be made manifestly inadequate because ordered to be served way of periodic detention (Sentencing Procedure Act s 6), home detention (Sentencing Procedure Act s 7), or by reason of being wholly suspended (Sentencing Procedure Act s 12). 
     
      
    65 Although the question never arose during the course of argument, and it would therefore be unfair to be unduly critical of the Crown, it seems to me that it is necessary, when appealing against a sentence to be served other than by way of full-time custody, that the Crown identify with more particularity than it has in the present case, the basis upon which it is said to be manifestly inadequate. In R v Thai [2009] NSWCCA 314 at [50] – [54] I expressed the view that, when the sentence against which the Crown appeals is one ordered to be served by way of periodic detention, the primary focus of this Court, in determining whether the sentence is manifestly inadequate, is upon the length of the sentence, and not the order that it be served by way of periodic detention. That is because the sentencing court is required, before considering periodic detention, to determine, and to impose, the sentence: it is only after the proper sentence has been imposed that it may be ameliorated by an order under s 6 of the Sentencing Procedure Act that it be served by way of periodic detention. The language of s 6(1) (“a court that has sentenced an offender to imprisonment for not more than 3 years may make a periodic detention order …” – italics added) supports that view; authority (R v Wegener [1999] NSWCCA 405 at [23]; R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [26]; Douar v R [2005] NSWCCA 455; (2005) 159 A Crim R 154; Reed v R [2007] NSWCCA 4 at [25]) supports that view; and the fact that a periodic detention order may be revoked by the Parole Authority (not by a court), as a consequence of which the offender will be required to serve the balance of the sentence in full-time custody (Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1999, ss 163, 164 – the same applies in relation to a sentence to be served by way of home detention (Administration of Sentences Act, ss 167, 168)), supports that view. A sentence must not, therefore, be extended by reason that it is to be served by way of periodic detention (see the cases cited above). The same, it appears to me, applies in relation to sentences to be served by way of home detention under s 7 of the Sentencing Procedure Act. In Thai I expressed, and I adhere to, the view that the same reasoning dictates that this Court approach a Crown appeal of a sentence to be served by way of periodic detention in the same way – that is, by first considering the length of the sentence imposed without regard to the order that it be served by way of periodic detention.  
     
      
    66 In Thai McClellan CJ at CL took a different view: see [6]. Hidden J found it unnecessary to decide. 
     
      
    67 The same line of reasoning applies to sentences that are suspended. So much has been held in Zamagias. A bond imposed under s 12(1)(b) may be revoked by a court (not the Parole Authority) for failure to comply with any of its conditions: Sentencing Procedure Act, s 98. Where that happens, the court is obliged to restructure the sentence into a non-parole period and a balance of term (or give reasons for not doing so). That carries the implication that a judge who is contemplating suspending a sentence needs to bear in mind that the sentence imposed – before suspension – ought to reflect an appropriate head sentence for the offence. 
     
      
    68 It is convenient here to set out the terms of s 12(1) of the Sentencing Procedure Act. It provides: 
     
      
       
        
        “12(1) A court that imposes a sentence of imprisonment on an offender (being a sentence for a term of not more than 2 years) may make an order:  
         
          
          (a) suspending execution of the whole of the sentence for such period (not exceeding the term of the sentence) as the court may specify in the order, and 
           
          (b) directing that the offender be released from custody on condition that the offender enters into a good behaviour bond for a term not exceeding the term of the sentence.”  
          
         
        
       
      
    69 In this case, it is not clear to me that the term of 2 years was manifestly inadequate. In this regard, the sentence imposed on Wanna is relevant, even on the basis that the respondent’s role involved him at a more organisational level. However, but for the long delay in bringing the respondent to sentence, together with his established rehabilitation, I would have no doubt that the order that the sentence be suspended was erroneous, and rendered the sentence imposed manifestly inadequate. Except for those circumstances, nothing other than a sentence of full-time custody was adequate to recognise:  
     
      
       
        the objective gravity of the substantive offence; 
       
       
        the Form 1 offences; 
       
       
        the respondent’s record of offences of like nature on two previous occasions; 
       
       
        the respondent’s criminal history otherwise; 
       
       
        that the respondent was on a bond at the time; 
       
       
        that, on two previous occasions, when the respondent had been granted significant indulgences (a home detention order, and parole) he abused the privilege and was returned to custody. 
       
      
    70 Even taking into account the two highly favourable features – delay and rehabilitation – it is difficult to conclude other than that the respondent should have been sentenced to a period of full-time custody. 
     
      
    71 Having regard to the view to which I have ultimately come as to the proper disposition of this appeal, it is unnecessary to reach a final view about manifest inadequacy. 
     
      
    72 Regrettably, the Court does not have available to it any information about the previous two occasions on which the respondent had committed offences of a similar kind to those now under consideration. His record certainly does nothing to assist him. He has repeatedly been given the benefit of lenient, non-custodial sentences, and has repeatedly abused the privilege. 
     
      
    73 One of these (delay) is of dubious validity, because it was, in some measure, brought about because of the respondent’s persistence, until the very last minute, in going to trial. Even so, however, one would not expect 2½ years to elapse before a date was fixed for trial. And the evidence showed that he used the time productively, in establishing his catering business, giving up gambling, and in bringing his personal life in to order, such that a finding that he was unlikely to offend could reasonably be made. 
     
      
    74 Against the possibility of a conclusion that the sentence was manifestly inadequate, the Court was provided with an affidavit affirmed by the respondent on 5 February 2010. He gave a history of having reported to the Probation and Parole Service. His marriage to Ms Liu has taken place, but he has been unable, by reason of bail conditions, to travel to China to meet his fiancée’s family. Following sentence, arrangements were made to travel to China, with his parents, for the purpose of marrying there. 
     
      
    75 Arrangements were made for the marriage to take place in NSW. However, shortly before that occurred, his mother was diagnosed as suffering from multiple myeloma. The travel to China was abandoned. 
     
      
    76 The respondent’s business has continued to grow. The respondent is working about 80 to 90 hours per week in the business. 
     
      
    77 All of this was put on the basis that this Court, even if having found manifest inadequacy, retains a discretion to decline to intervene. 
     
      
    78 And there is another factor. The respondent was sentenced on 14 August 2009. The Crown appeal was filed and served reasonably promptly (17 September and 20 September respectively). Ordinarily, such an appeal would be brought on for hearing with expedition. But, in this case (as in many others) additional delay was brought about by reason of the introduction into the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 of s 68A, effective from 24 September 2009 and made retrospective to extend to appeals commenced but not finally determined as at that date (including this appeal). Section 68A significantly varied the manner in which this Court is to deal with Crown appeals against sentence. The extent of that variation was initially uncertain. It was resolved by the decision of this Court, sitting as a bench of five, in R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49, delivered on 22 March 2010. The hearing of many Crown appeals, or delivering of judgment in those that were heard (of which this was one) was delayed pending guidance as to the proper interpretation of s 68A. The end result of that has been to impose yet further delay in the resolution of this appeal. It is now 3½ years since the respondent’s offences: he has turned that time to advantage, and demonstrated that his rehabilitation is complete. 
     
      
    79 An additional affidavit affirmed by the respondent on 26 March, was received. This reveals that the condition of his mother has deteriorated, and that his wife is pregnant. 
     
      
    80 One of the things that was decided in JW was that the discretion that this Court has always had to decline to intervene in a sentence that is shown to be manifestly inadequate continues to exist, although it may not be exercised on the basis of the distress or anxiety to which all respondents to Crown appeals are presumed to be subject (shortly known as double jeopardy). It may, however, be exercised on grounds that do not fall within that description. 
     
      
    81 I have concluded that grounds for the exercise of the discretion here exist. They are essentially the same grounds as moved the sentencing judge to suspend the sentence – but they are now made manifestly stronger by the additional delay, in combination with the respondent’s demonstrated rehabilitation. Even if the sentence initially imposed was manifestly inadequate by reason of the suspension, I would, in the exercise of this Court’s discretion, dismiss the Crown appeal. 
     
      
    82 The Court has also received additional submissions from the Crown. These do not persuade me that the course I propose ought not to be followed. 
     
      
    83 I propose the following order: 
     
      
       
      (i) Crown appeal dismissed. 
       
      
    84 R A HULME J: Subject to what immediately follows I agree with the judgment of Simpson J.85 I agree with what her Honour has said in the first sentence of paragraph 65 of her judgment. However I am unable to agree with what then follows in relation to the point she raised in R v Thai, supra. The matter was of some controversy in that case. It is not a matter that needs to be determined for the resolution of the present case and was not the subject of submissions. Accordingly I refrain from expressing a view about it.86 There is also an observation that I wish to make. The sentence of imprisonment for a term of 2 years that was imposed by North DCJ was lenient but it was made inadequate by the order that its execution be suspended. That order could only have been made if the judge first determined that there should be a sentence of imprisonment for a term of not more than 2 years (s 12(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999). North DCJ arrived at the sentence of 2 years after having said that he would, “discount … the offender’s sentence otherwise to be imposed by ten percent because of the plea (of guilty)”. His Honour did not explain in his sentencing remarks what sentence he would otherwise have imposed. Mathematically, it must have been one of 2 years 2 months and some 20 days. Perhaps he had in mind a sentence of 2 years 3 months and there was some rounding down. Both seem to be curious starting points.87 One of the purposes for which a range of “discount” for the utilitarian value of pleas of guilty was identified in R v Thomson & Houlton [2000] NSWCCA 309, 49 NSWLR 383 was to improve the transparency of the process: per Spigelman CJ at [162]. To my mind, to indicate that a certain “discount” will be allowed and then to impose a sentence that leaves considerable doubt as to whether the sentence has been so reduced does nothing to foster the transparency of which the Chief Justice spoke. An offender, the community and an appellate court are left to speculate as to whether the sentence was reduced and, if so, whether it was to the extent indicated. 88 Where a judge announces that he or she intends to allow a percentage reduction for the utilitarian value of a plea of guilty and subsequently imposes a sentence that is the most that can be the subject of an order suspending the sentence (2 years), or the subject of an order that the sentence be served by way of periodic or home detention (3 years or 18 months (ss 6(1) and 7(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act) respectively), and it appears that the starting point is, as in the present case, a most unlikely one, again, the offender, the community and an appellate court are left to wonder whether there has in fact been a reduction of the sentence in the specified terms or whether the sentencer has simply selected a sentence that fits within the prescribed maximum limit for a sentence to be suspended or served in an alternative way.

   DECISION : 
   The offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 18 years 9 months and a balance of term of 6 years 3 months. The sentence is to commence on 7 June 2008 and the non-parole period expires on 6 March 2027. This is a sentence of imprisonment for 25 years and the offender cannot be considered for release to parole until 6 March 2027. It will then be a matter for the Parole Board to determine whether she can be released safely into the community.After sentence was imposed, it was brought to my attention by the parties that I had failed to deal with two matters under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act, they being related matters of drive with middle range PCA and drive whilst unlicensed. These are matters that were taken into account when I assessed the objective seriousness of the offence of murder. There is no purpose in imposing any additional punishment for these offences. In respect of each the offender is convicted under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 without any punishment.

      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The offender was convicted by a jury of murder arising from an incident during which she intentionally drove a motor vehicle at the deceased, Eli Westlake. At the commencement of the trial the offender pleaded guilty to manslaughter, but the Crown rejected the plea. From defence counsel’s opening to the jury, it seems that the plea was based upon an acceptance by the offender that she acted with gross criminal negligence in the control of her vehicle resulting in the deceased’s death. 
     
      
    2 The facts can be stated briefly. There was some dispute as to the incidents leading up to the killing, but a CCTV camera operating on premises next to where the killing took place captured the driving of the vehicle immediately before, and at the time of, the killing. Much of the evidence at the trial related to the background to these events and need not be given in any detail. 
     
      
    3 The deceased, his brother Joel and a number of other young persons had gathered at Joel’s home principally to record music by a band in which a number of them played. After the recording session concluded they consumed alcohol and eventually decided to walk the short distance from the premises to a local tavern. CCTV footage shows that at about 3.00am the group walked past the place where the main incidents leading to the death of the deceased later occurred. The deceased is easily distinguishable from the others because he is the only person wearing a white top. The group went to the tavern where they drank alcohol, talked and played pool. They left at closing time, about 4.00am. 
     
      
    4 In the meantime the offender had left her premises with a companion to purchase cigarettes at a convenience store on the corner of Christie Street and the Pacific Highway at St Leonards. This store is directly opposite the tavern on the other side of the Pacific Highway where the group of young persons had been drinking. The offender had been consuming alcohol since the afternoon and had also smoked cannabis. She took the keys of the vehicle owned by the person, with whom she was residing at the time, without his knowledge. She was unlicensed to drive and was very much under the influence of alcohol. 
     
      
    5 She drove the vehicle down the Pacific Highway and eventually entered Christie Street at the corner where the convenience store was situated. In the meantime the deceased’s group had left the tavern. They crossed the Pacific Highway and entered Christie Street. As they passed the store, the deceased decided he wanted something to eat. He, his brother and a third member of the group became separated from the rest while a packet of, what has been referred to as, “cheese balls” was purchased. By this time the rest of the group had gone down Christie Lane that ran from Christie Street not far from the convenience store to Lithgow Street. There they waited for the other three to join them. 
     
      
    6 Just how the three, who had stopped at the store, and the offender’s vehicle came into contact was never made clear. It seems obvious to me that at some stage, as the three young men entered Christie Lane, the offender turned into the lane from Christie Street. She had travelled past the parking available outside the store and turned into the lane. She was going the wrong way in what was a one-way street. At about this time something occurred that caused the three young men to react to the offender’s driving. Whether she sounded her horn, or startled them or simply because she was driving the wrong way in the lane, the deceased reacted by throwing the cheese balls into the air onto the front of the vehicle. He made some sarcastic remark wishing the occupants “happy anniversary” or something similar. 
     
      
    7 There was abuse thrown between the three young men and the occupants of the vehicle causing the passenger to get out of the vehicle to confront them. However, he decided discretion was the better part of valour as Joel was a very heavily built young man whereas the passenger was slight. There is a dispute as to what then occurred. I believe that as the passenger tried to re-enter the vehicle, there was a tug of war between one or more of the young men and the passenger resulting in the passenger’s shirt and jumper being pulled off him. It was not a serious incident and the passenger regained the safety of the vehicle and retained his clothing. 
     
      
    8 At about this time the offender exited the motor vehicle. She was in a highly aggressive and abusive state. I have no doubt that she confronted Joel, remonstrated with him and commenced to physically attack him. At least one of the three was trying to placate the offender indicating that it was only cheese balls that had been thrown onto the vehicle. An observer, Mr Coyle, believed that the deceased was wiping the vehicle with his top in an endeavour to convince the offender that no harm had been done. I find that the offender struck at Joel and at one stage tried to kick him. I believe Joel retaliated and as a result the offender was either pushed or fended off so that she fell to the ground at least once. 
     
      
    9 Shortly after this incident the three men turned and left the vehicle walking down the lane to Lithgow Street where the rest of the group were waiting. Joel, with some premonition of danger, ran up Lithgow Street having warned the others to be careful of the vehicle. At the end of the lane the offender could have driven to the right up to the Pacific Highway which could be easily seen about 50 metres away. However she chose to turn left into that part of Lithgow Street where the group were walking on the pavement. This was an area where a number of commercial premises backed onto the street. There were a number of very large driveways. 
     
      
    10 The offender drove along Lithgow Street and suddenly turned left into one of the driveways at the very moment that the deceased was walking across the driveway. She either struck him or came very close to him and he avoided the vehicle at the last moment. This can be seen on the CCTV footage. The vehicle then reversed and the deceased can be seen walking near the passenger side of the car, clearly remonstrating with the occupants. He is then pulled away by one of the group, Stuart Taylor. 
     
      
    11 The deceased and Taylor then waited behind one of the two industrial bins that were on the kerbside. The offender’s vehicle remained in the middle of Lithgow Street. Although the vehicle is out of the range of the CCTV, the headlights can be seen. The vehicle appears to straighten but remains where it is in Lithgow Street. 
     
      
    12 One of the group had been lying on the grass verge on the other side of the driveway waiting for the others. He was warned by another of the group to get up because someone was trying to kill them. He got to his feet. The deceased can be seen on the CCTV footage leaving from behind the bins and crossing the driveway. He walked onto the verge close to the building at the far end of the driveway. Suddenly the headlights of the offender’s vehicle appear to go into high beam. The vehicle drove diagonally from the street mounting the curb. It hit a glancing blow to the young man who had been lying on the grass. It then made contact with the deceased who was struck by the front of the vehicle and carried forward. The vehicle continued until it careered down a flight of stairs to a gym at the corner of the building taking the deceased with it and crushing him beneath the vehicle at the foot of the stairs. 
     
      
    13 The offender tried to put the vehicle into reverse but it did not move. The passenger exited the vehicle taking the keys with him and fled the scene. Joel returned down Lithgow Street to the scene of the accident. He was joined by some of the group at the front of the vehicle and they tried to lift it off the deceased. By this time the offender had alighted and went to the front of the vehicle where she tried to help. Joel accused her of having killed his brother and she was told to leave. The offender was in a highly emotional condition on the roadway when a nurse from nearby premises arrived to offer support. 
     
      
    14 At this time a call was made to emergency services. A short time later an ambulance arrived and then the police. The offender was in a very distressed state and concerned that she may have killed the deceased. She eventually made two recorded interviews. In both she was distressed but gave an account that the jury must have rejected. That account was in effect that, as a result of the incident in the lane, she was terrified and wanted to escape the group. She said that turning into Lithgow Street she saw more of the group and panicked. She tried to do a thee-point turn to get away. She said that the passenger pulled the wheel and that because of her boots she hit the accelerator and was unable to stop the vehicle. 
     
      
    15 As I have indicated, this account was the basis of her plea of guilty to manslaughter but the jury obviously and properly rejected it. I believe that there was more to the incident in the laneway than Joel and the other man who was present were prepared to concede and that there was some aggression at least to the passenger. But thereafter the aggressor was the offender. I do not believe that she was set upon in the way she described. She was by and large the cause of any injuries she suffered. She was not provoked but was incensed by the fact that she had been humiliated as she saw it and had decided to retaliate. 
     
      
    16 In this regard the most highly relevant statement she made in her interviews was what she said about the effect of alcohol upon her. She told police that sometimes she could not handle it. When asked by the police about what happens when she could not handle it, she replied: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “I suppose I can get emotional and fight.” 
        
       
       
      Although she then denied getting aggressive, I believe her answer was an accurate description of her reaction to alcohol on the night of the killing. 
       
      
    17 It should be made clear that in no way was any member of the deceased’s group, including the deceased’s brother, responsible for his death. The incident in the lane was a relatively trivial one no doubt arising because all the parties were intoxicated. It was when the offender alighted from the vehicle that the incident increased in its seriousness because of her uncontrolled fury. Her aggression continued from the lane into the vehicle, and she told her passenger that she was “sick of them”. When she turned left into Lithgow Street she clearly wanted to teach the young men a lesson. I have no doubt she chose the deceased to vent her anger upon, probably because he could be identified by the white top and because his brother was no longer in the immediate vicinity. The passenger sensed what was happening. He warned her against doing anything that was likely to damage the motor vehicle. 
     
      
    18 I am prepared to find that when she first drove into the driveway she was acting only to scare the deceased. There is no doubt that she achieved that result. But this did not mollify her. Rather I think that the deceased’s reaction by remonstrating with the occupants of the vehicle further angered her. I have no doubt that she waited in the street until the deceased would venture out of hiding. He did so but seeking the protection of the wall at the end of the driveway. As soon as he crossed on to the verge, the deceased saw him, put the lights into high beam and drove straight at him. 
     
      
    19 I do not believe she intended to kill him but the jury were right to conclude that she at least intended to seriously injure him. If she only intended to scare him, there was no reason to drive at him the second time as she had already given him a fright. In the circumstance where a vehicle is being used as a weapon against a person who is incapable of defending himself or taking evasive action, there is little difference between an intention to kill and an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. There was a real likelihood that whatever injury resulted was going to be serious. 
     
      
    20 The offender has a criminal record from 1989 mainly for traffic matters. However she was convicted of malicious wounding in the Local Court in 2001 and received a suspended sentence of 12 months. That offence occurred on 14 October 2000. The offender who was intoxicated had an argument with her then husband over family matters. Her husband was lying face down on the lounge when the offender stabbed him twice with a kitchen knife. She was immediately remorseful for what she had done and called an ambulance.  
     
      
    21 In 2002 she was fined in June for contravening a domestic violence order taken out by her husband and fined again in December for assaulting him. In 2003 she received a suspended sentence for entering a dwelling with intent to assault the victim who was lying on her bed in her home. The offence occurred in October 2002. The offender, having looked through an open window and seen the victim, climbed through the window and started punching the victim asking for the return of her money. She was also charged with assaulting the victim causing her actual bodily harm. She breached the bond in respect of both those offences as she was called up and ordered to serve the suspended sentence by way of periodic detention. The breach appears to have been another assault upon her husband in February 2003. 
     
      
    22 The offender has a bad driving record including a low range PCA in 1989 and then a number of charges of being an unlicensed driver. In 2004 she was fined for driving while suspended and driving with mid range PCA. She was both unlicensed and in the high range of PCA at the time of the killing. 
     
      
    23 Evidence was given as to the offender’s history of psychiatric treatment before the jury in respect of the issue of substantial impairment. There is no doubt that she suffers from a mental disturbance, probably a bipolar disorder that was first diagnosed in 2009. The issue in the trial was whether that disorder was relevant at the time of the killing. A major difficulty with the defence was that the offender was highly intoxicated at the time and the jury had to disregard the evidence of intoxication when considering whether that defence had been made out. Despite the views of Dr Roberts I do not believe that she suffered from any brain injury. Nothing found in the neuropsychological examination conducted by Dr Pullman contributed to the events of this night. 
     
      
    24 Simply because the jury rejected the defence of substantial impairment, it does not follow that I cannot or should not take into account any mental condition that may have contributed to the commission of the offence. However, I am satisfied by the evidence of Dr Allnutt that the offender’s mental disorder had nothing to do with the offending. She was not suffering from mania at the time. She simply is very aggressive when under the influence of alcohol. She was aware that whenever she is under the influence of alcohol she is likely to act in an impulsive, aggressive manner to people or things that irritate her. 
     
      
    25 The offender was born on 5 January 1971 and is aged 39. She has a son aged 14 who resides with her former husband in Coffs Harbour. She is visited in custody by her mother and occasionally her son. Psychiatric problems became first evident in her school years and she commenced using alcohol and cannabis in her teens. She left school at 15 having been a difficult student. She was first diagnosed with having ADHD at the age of 20. She was prescribed medication that she did not take. She binged on alcohol and used cannabis. At age 21 she started using heroin. She was diagnosed with depression at this time and the depression increased after she was sexually assaulted at the age of 30. She is generally depressed although at times she was suffering from a change of mood in which she would find her mind racing and become talkative and irritable. She suffers from substance abuse disorder in relation to alcohol and drugs. She has had various forms of work throughout her life, including modelling, but found that her drug taking interfered with steady employment. She had last worked four weeks before the offence. 
     
      
    26 In the period prior to the offending she had been binge drinking, smoking cannabis, and using valium over the prescribed dose. She had recently visited her son, which she found stressful and she was trying to secure a place for her and him to live together. She had not suffered from anxiety or panic attacks the week before and was generally hopeful and happy about resolving the situation with her son. 
     
      
    27 While in custody she had been prescribed various medications to stabilise her emotions. She had found Seroquel helpful and has been taking it at the prescribed dose. She had been recently diagnosed with bipolar disorder. As I have indicated I am not satisfied that her culpability was reduced because of her mental disorder. Whether it has any other relevance I will discuss later. 
     
      
    28 This was not an impulsive offence. But it was not long in the planning and was a result of her instantaneous angry reaction to the incident in the laneway. But she could have changed her mind when she reached the end of the laneway and brought this incident to an end by turning onto the Pacific Highway in the direction of where she was staying. The passenger warned her against doing anything rash when she turned left into Lithgow Street. After the first incident when she drove at the deceased she had time to reflect upon her conduct and could have continued up Lithgow Street and again brought the incident to an end. She was never in any danger from the group when she was in Lithgow Street. 
     
      
    29 I accept that she was immediately remorseful. That is why she tried to help lift the vehicle. It was one of those acts, probably like the stabbing of her husband, that was immediately regretted after it had occurred. She probably lied to the police because she could not admit to herself what she had done as much as wishing to escape punishment. 
     
      
    30 Because the offence carries a standard non-parole period it is necessary to undertake the stepped approach that has been set out by the Court of Criminal Appeal. First I have to determine where in the range of murders this particular offence lies. This is a task that must sound callous to the deceased’s family who would be entitled to believe that it is in the worst category because it involved the deceased and was such an over-reaction to what was a trivial incident. It must have been unbearable for the deceased’s brother to be unable to help him. A number of the group who gave evidence at the trial are clearly traumatised, as of course are the deceased’s parents and his brother. 
     
      
    31 But there are different categories of murder. For example a killing by a professional hit man must be towards the top of the scale. In order to determine where this offence lays in the range one must look at its objective seriousness. The law is, that in determining this issue, a judge cannot look at the consequences of the killing upon those who are affected by it. The law protects all human life and it is as serious to kill a homeless person as it is to kill a famous heart surgeon. Here the life taken was a young man of considerable talent, much loved by family and friends and his family is inconsolable in their loss. But that cannot be factored into the assessment of punishment. It is a crime against the community in general. The law cannot seek to place a value on a particular life and attempt to impose retribution commensurate with that value. However, the very moving victim impacts statements should bring home to the offender the grief she has brought to others in the community by her senseless act of anger. 
     
      
    32 The typical case of murder coming before this Court is probably lower than mid-range. These tend to be domestic killings usually in the heat of the moment and often fuelled by alcohol. This offence seems to me to be more serious than that. Very few murders are planned although they may occur in the course of planned activity. Those where the killing is planned would almost inevitably be well above mid-range. This was not planned in any long-term sense but it was not an instantaneous reaction to the events in the lane. 
     
      
    33 There are aggravating factors under s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 that impact upon the objective seriousness of the offence. There was a use of a weapon and one of a particularly dangerous kind when used as the offender used it. Although the offence was committed without regard for public safety in that there were other persons in the vicinity of the driving, it seems to me that this aggravating factor is subsumed by the fact that this offence involved a grave risk of death to another person. The offender struck another young man with the motor vehicle as she drove it in the direction of the deceased. He was fortunate not to be killed or more seriously injured. It does not matter that the offender may not have been aware of that person or of the risk she was causing to him. Although the Crown submitted that the deceased was vulnerable, this is not the type of vulnerability with which the section is concerned. 
     
      
    34 There was in my opinion no provocation, or, if there were, it was of such a minor nature and so out of proportion to the consequences of the offender’s act that it should not mitigate the offence. It explains why the killing occurred but it does not diminish her objective culpability. As I have indicated, it was the offender who was the aggressor once she exited the vehicle. Further she had opportunity to take stock of the situation having been warned by her passenger and after she had driven at the deceased on the first occasion. It is clear that she waited for the deceased to emerge from behind the safety of the bins for another chance to vent her rage and seek retribution. Her mental disorder or any psychological abnormality was not related to the offence so as to diminish her culpability. Nor was the fact that she was under the influence of alcohol. It may explain why she reacted so aggressively but she was aware that she could be aggressive when drunk. 
     
      
    35 The offence is in my opinion in the mid-range of offending. This is despite the fact that I am prepared to sentence her on the basis of an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm rather than an intention to kill. It was an intention to inflict very serious injury and the risk of death was very high. 
     
      
    36 The only matter of mitigation is her remorse. I accept that almost immediately she regretted her actions. Her remorse for the killing is not inconsistent with the fact that she pleaded not guilty to murder. She accepted responsibility for the killing when she pleaded guilty to manslaughter although she tried to minimise her culpability. Her remorse is confirmed by the letter from the chaplain at the prison. There is also considerable evidence of remorse in the psychological notes from the Department of Corrective Services.  
     
      
    37 There is no evidence before me that her mental disorder makes prison more onerous for her. It certainly does not negate or diminish general deterrence to any significant degree. It is clear that all of her offending has been as a result of alcohol abuse yet, despite her involvement with the probation service, she continues to abuse alcohol and drugs rather than take prescribed medication to address her problems. I have no views on her prospects of rehabilitation although if she addresses her reliance upon alcohol and is more amenable to proper medication to treat her mental disorder and to give herself more emotional stability she is unlikely to re-offend. But this will require her to change a pattern of behaviour that has persisted for a number of years. 
     
      
    38 It appears that much of her depression and anxiety that has resulted in her inability to cope is the result of traumatic events in her past. Her mother described her attitude to life to a probation officer in July 2003 as immature and irresponsible and her lifestyle as chaotic. This seems to have continued until the commission of the present offence. She has, however, since coming into custody for this offence been compliant with her medication and sought psychological counselling. She has completed a Getting SMART programme. Her criminal record does not assist her although it is not an aggravating factor. 
     
      
    39 There are no special circumstances requiring that the parole period be greater than would result from an application of the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the total term. Nor is there any reason to reduce the non-parole period. There will be ample time on parole for her to receive whatever assistance she might require when released from custody. I have departed from the standard non-parole period because of her immediate and continuing remorse for having killed the deceased. 
     
      
    40 The offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment made up of a non-parole period of 18 years 9 months and a balance of term of 6 years 3 months. The sentence is to commence on 7 June 2008 and the non–parole period expires on 6 March 2027. This is in effect a sentence of imprisonment for 25 years and the offender cannot be considered for release to parole until 6 March 2027. It will then be a matter for the Parole Board to determine whether she can be released safely into the community. 
     
      
    41 After sentence was imposed, it was brought to my attention by the parties that I had failed to deal with two matters under s 166 of the Criminal Procedure Act, they being related matters of drive with middle range PCA and drive whilst unlicensed. These are matters that were taken into account when I assessed the objective seriousness of the offence of murder. There is no purpose in imposing any additional punishment for these offences. In respect of each the offender is convicted under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 without any punishment.

     Judgment 
    [1] These are my reasons for dismissing the application brought by the defendant for these proceedings (which is set down for hearing as a 5-day non-jury trial for 7 June 2010) to be heard by a jury.[2] The plaintiff commenced proceedings on 24 September 2009 by Statement of Claim pleading publication of an email by the defendant on 10 June 2009 conveyed the following imputations: 
     
     “A. That the plaintiff was a bully (Line 7). 
      
      
     B. That the plaintiff conspired with others to dishonestly obtain the benefit of the publisher’s sale territory (Lines 9-11). 
      
      
     C. That the plaintiff as a Manager was unprofessional (Lines 12-13). 
      
      
     D. That the plaintiff was a liar (Line 16). 
      
      
     E. That the plaintiff was a thief (Line 16). 
      
      
     F. That the plaintiff was not suitable for a position of Manager (Lines 21-22) 
      
      
     G. That the plaintiff was dishonest (Lines 21-22). 
      
      
     H. That the business of Muswellbrook operations of Total Fasteners deteriorated as a result of the failings of the plaintiff (Lines 22-24).” 
    [3] There has never been any determination of form and capacity of the imputations.[4] On 30 October 2009, the defendant filed a Cross-Claim in defamation and subsequently, on 4 November 2009, a Defence was filed pleading defences of truth, contextual truth, comment and qualified privilege.[5] Although a Notice of Intention to Elect Trial by Jury in Defamation Proceedings was filed by the defendant on 13 October 2009, no announcement was made in court by the defendant when the matter was next before the court on 11 December 2009 for the trial to proceed by way of a jury trial contrary to Part 29 r 29.2(4) Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 2005 (NSW). Further directions hearings were held on 12 February, 26 February and 19 March 2010, when the matter was listed for hearing as a 5-day non-jury matter. [6] The matter was given a degree of fast tracking because of the limited extent of publication of the matter complained of as set out in paragraph 1 of the Statement of Claim. When the matter was set down for hearing, Mr Rasmussen, who appeared for the defendant, did not oppose the matter being set down for hearing, provisionally, for Monday 7 June 2010 as a 5-day non-jury matter.[7] My associate then received the following letter on 23 March 2010 from the solicitors for the defendant: 
     
     “We refer to the Directions Hearing in this matter on Friday 19 March 2010 when a Hearing date was set for 7 June 2010 as a  
     non-jury trial 
      with an estimate of five days. 
      
      
     We  
     enclose 
      Notice of Intention to Elect Trial by Jury in Defamation Proceedings which was filed with the Court on 13 October 2009. 
      
      
     The matter is next before Her Honour on 16 April 2010. 
      
      
     At that time we respectfully request that our Notice of Intention to Elect Trial by Jury be noted, and the appropriate order be made to ensure that this matter is heard before a jury.” 
    [8] When the matter came before me on 16 April 2010, this being for the purpose of review of the readiness of the matter for trial as a non-jury matter, Mr Evatt, who appeared for the defendant, raised with me whether the trial would proceed as a non-jury trial or as a jury trial.[9] Upon it being drawn to Mr Evatt’s attention that his client had not served the Notice of Intention, made a jury announcement, filed a requisition for jury or paid the fee, and had consented to the matter being set down (albeit provisionally) as a non-jury hearing, in circumstances where the hearing date would have to be vacated, Mr Evatt said that he would make no further submissions. As an experienced jury advocate who has appeared in a number of trials since the enactment of the Defamation Act 2005 (NSW), Mr Evatt agreed that there was no prospect of the jury trial being completed in 5 days; the “triple length” rule (on page 18-19) referred to by McClellan CJ at CL in his recent discussion paper “Eloquence and Reason - are juries appropriate for defamation trials?” <http://www.lawlink.nsw.gov.au/lawlink/Supreme_Court/ll_sc.nsf/vwFiles/mcclellan041109.pdf/$file/mcclellan041109.pdf> given on 4 November 2009 is far more likely to be correct. This is especially so in circumstances where the defendant has filed a cross-claim in defamation, which presents as a further complication adding to the length of the trial.[10] I have set out in my judgments in Bechara v Bonacorso (No. 3) [2010] NSWDC 52 and Allen v Lloyd-Jones (No. 3) [2010] NSWDC 53 the relevant rules and procedure for:  
     
     (a) the filing of a Notice of Intention to Elect Trial by Jury in Defamation Proceedings (s 21(2)(a)  
     Defamation Act 
      2005 (NSW), r 29.2(3)  
     Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 
      2005 (NSW)); 
      
      
     (b) a public announcement in court (r 29.2(4)  
     Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 
      2005 (NSW)); 
      
      
     (c) the filing of a requisition for jury (s 76A  
     District Court Act  
     1973 (NSW); r 29.2(2)  
     Uniform Civil Procedure Rules 
      2005 (NSW)); and 
      
      
     (d) the payment of the $913 jury fee (s 21(2)(b)  
     Defamation Act  
     2005 (NSW);  
     Civil Procedure Regulation  
     2005 (NSW), Schedule 1, Part 3 cl 4). 
    [11] The plaintiff sought an order for costs on the basis of the lateness of the application, the circumstances in which prior notification had not been given to the court and lack of notice to the plaintiff of this proposal.[12] The procedure for requisitioning a jury should by now be clear to practitioners. Fundamental to this procedure is the early notification not only of the court by way of an announcement made in open court but, just as importantly, if not more so, by the service of the relevant documents on the opposing party.Orders(1) Application by the defendant for the hearing fixed for 7 June 2010 (5 day estimate) to proceed by way of jury is dismissed with costs.(2) Judge Gibson to email judgment to parties.

      2008/165581 REGINA v Mark Robin WILHELM 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: On 21 April last the offender, Mark Robin Wilhelm, pleaded guilty to an offence of supply a prohibited drug. That drug being Gamma Hydroxybuterate known as GHB. 
     
      
    2 The circumstances in which Mr Wilhelm came to commit that offence must be known to almost every member of the adult community of this State and really there is little for me to say about the nature of the offence. 
     
      
    3 However, for the purposes of sentencing him I should indicate that the facts are that the offender took on board the cruise an amount of the drug. How much drug he had and what he intended to do with it is not in the evidence. However, there is no suggestion at all that he intended to do anything with the drug by way of a commercial nature. 
     
      
    4 Mrs Brimble, a mature woman, although under the influence of alcohol, as was the offender, went to the offender’s cabin in order to have consensual intercourse with him. While in the cabin Mrs Brimble observed the offender was doing something with a liquid and asked what he was doing. The offender told her that he was having some fantasy, which is a street name for the drug which is also called GHB. Mrs Brimble asked what it was and the offender said that it was like ecstasy but it made you ten times hornier. 
     
      
    5 The offender consumed a dose of the drug by pouring some of it into the lid of a water bottle and drinking it and then poured a similar dose for Mrs Brimble, which she consumed. It is a matter of history now that as a result of the ingestion of that drug and her previous ingestion of alcohol that Mrs Brimble died as a result, in effect, of failure to breathe as a consequence of the effect of the drug on her central nervous system. 
     
      
    6 It must be obvious that I am sentencing the offender only for supply of a drug to Mrs Brimble. I cannot sentence him for any other offence that he may have committed in relation to either Mrs Brimble or in relation to the drug. In particular, I am not sentencing the offender for the consequences of his supply of the drug to Mrs Brimble. That material must be put to one side and concentration must be on the nature of the supply of the drug for which he has pleaded guilty and for which he must be sentenced. 
     
      
    7 The offence of supply, when charged on indictment, as this charge is, would normally carry a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment. However, a supply of this nature would never be dealt with on indictment except in the very exceptional circumstances of this particular case. That is because a supply of this nature would never be so serious as to warrant prosecution in the District Court or Supreme Court and would never warrant any consideration of the maximum penalty for the offence when prosecuted on indictment. In fact, it is almost unknown for a charge of supply of drugs to be prosecuted in this Court. 
     
      
    8 The reason why the offender is before this Court and not before a Magistrate is because he was charged after a coronial inquiry with an ex officio indictment alleging both that he unlawfully killed Mrs Brimble and that he supplied her with the drug GHB. The history of the matter is that the offender has always pleaded not guilty to both the supply of the drug and bringing about the death of Mrs Brimble. 
     
      
    9 It is also history that he recently attempted to plead guilty to an offence in relation to the effect of the drug on Mrs Brimble. That plea was allowed to be withdrawn because in my view he had not committed the offence to which he had pleaded guilty. As I have made perfectly clear, Mrs Brimble was voluntarily consuming the drug, even though she did so under the influence of alcohol and therefore in no way was the offender responsible for the effect of the drug upon Mrs Brimble. No more needs to be said about it. 
     
      
    10 If this matter were dealt with, as it normally would, before the Magistrate, the maximum penalty is one of two years imprisonment. Depending upon whether the quantity of the drug is a small quantity or where it is over a small quantity, that affects the fine that might be imposed upon the offender. 
     
      
    11 This is an unusual supply offence to have been prosecuted. The reason for that is because almost invariably an offence of supply that results in a charge before a court is a supply for profit. The police would have observed the offence take place or the supply was to an under-cover police officer or something of that nature.  
     
      
    12 It is in my experience rare to have what I might call a social supply offence before the Court. The reason for that is because both the person supplying the drug and the person receiving and administering the drug are committing offences. It was an offence for Mrs Brimble to consume the drug just as it was an offence for the offender to supply it to her. In those circumstances it seems unlikely that persons involved in that activity are going to bring the matter before the authorities. 
     
      
    13 Therefore, on the scale of offences of supply it must be on the very lowest rung. I cannot think of a supply offence which would be less serious than that committed by the offender in relation to Mrs Brimble. 
     
      
    14 The statistics for offences dealt with in the Local Court, in relation to ecstasy, which is not the same drug but something akin to it, show that very few offenders received a prison sentence for a single offence of supply. Of 37 people who fell into that category only two received gaol sentences and one can only imagine whether that was because of their criminal records or the nature of the supply. The largest percentage of persons in that category received a s 9 bond, that is, they were placed on a good behaviour bond and provided that they did not re-offend no action would be taken in respect of the offence. 
     
      
    15 The offender has a very limited criminal record. He was fined for an offence in 2001 that can be disregarded as being irrelevant; it had nothing to do with the use of drugs. Of more concern is that in 2005 he was charged with what was in effect cultivation of cannabis but that offence has to be seen in the somewhat unusual legislation that I understand exists in South Australia in relation to the use of cannabis. That State takes a different approach to that drug than other States do. The only matter of concern is that the offender was involved in another drug offence whilst under the cloud, if I may say so, of this matter. However, that penalty, because he was not convicted, does not seem to me to be of any great significance in determining what I should do with him in respect of this supply. 
     
      
    16 A large amount of material has been placed before me really to indicate that substantially the offender is a person of good behaviour and of good reputation, apart from the reputation that has been destroyed by the allegations made against him and the reporting of those allegations in the media. This is not meant to criticise the media, it is not for me to sit in judgment of the media or their behaviour in respect of this matter. But as I have already indicated in this Court, there was a degree of hysteria which surrounded the allegations in respect of the death of Mrs Brimble which was brought about by rumours and mistakes or misunderstandings in relation to the events of the particular night and they do not need to be revisited for the purposes of sentencing the offender. The relevance, however, is the effect this has had upon the offender. 
     
      
    17 I myself am aware of much of the publicity and it would be impossible for any adult in this State not to be aware of it. There have been some suggestions at times of callousness in respect of this offender and others in respect of the death of Mrs Brimble. In respect of one person it would be justified and again I do not sit in judgment of that person. But in respect of this offender such an allegation is not justified. As soon as he discovered that Mrs Brimble was unconscious he tried to assist her. This is part of the reason why the Crown case for manslaughter failed. More than that, there was evidence before the Court during the trial and now before me of the reaction of the offender once he had sobered up and once he was aware of the real situation and what had happened to Mrs Brimble. 
     
      
    18 There was admitted into evidence at the time of the trial and admitted into evidence before me in the present proceedings a statement by a counsellor who was on board at the time of the death of Mrs Brimble. She makes it quite clear, in very impressive terms, the extraordinary effect that the death of Mrs Brimble had upon the offender, who was distraught and unable to comprehend the effect of what had occurred by what, to him, was a fairly minor incident in supplying the drug to Mrs Brimble and having intercourse with her. But that remorse and reaction has continued over the years. 
     
      
    19 There are before me a number of psychiatric reports which indicate that the offender has, over a long period of time, suffered from severe mental illness as a result of the allegations against him, the publicity of them and the ramifications of what he has done. Again because I am sentencing him for the offence of supply, it is unnecessary to go into those matters in any detail. However, nobody should have any doubt that Mr Wilhelm has suffered grievously as a result of what occurred on that particular night. 
     
      
    20 He has, through a period of years, been subject to acute mental illness as a result of depression and anxiety, not simply for himself and the predicament he found himself in but because of the reaction it has had on him, his family and the Brimble family, as a result, as I have said, what would have been seen by him as an insignificant incident that occurred on this cruise boat.  
     
      
    21 I mention these matters only because it is a significant punishment that he has already suffered. The Court takes into account, as it is able to do, what is called extra-curial punishment, that is, punishment that is inflicted upon an offender otherwise than by a court of law. There are many instances of this sort of factor being taken into account in sentencing. 
     
      
    22 In this case the offender has been subject to an enormous amount of public derision that has stigmatised him and others as persons of bad character that has led to death threats being sent to him by members of the community so whipped up have they been by the reporting of the incident. 
     
      
    23 This, unfortunately, is not unusual. The Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of Allpass took into account the effect that publicity of the offence and the sentence imposed upon the offender had upon members of the community who had acted as vigilantes in threatening Mr Allpass, a man of some senility, and his wife and damage to their home. 
     
      
    24 So here I am entitled to take into account not only issues of public humiliation of the offender but also the consequences of that upon him and his mental health. I do not think it is an exaggeration to say that his life has been destroyed. His marriage has broken up, he has lost his home, he has had to move interstate to find work.  
     
      
    25 He has had to come to this State to face a criminal trial. The first trial was funded by himself privately such that he now is eligible for Legal Aid, so lacking in finances is he in order to defend himself. 
     
      
    26 Any reasonable person in the community would see that this punishment exceeds in any way, shape or form the criminality of the supply to Mrs Brimble in the social context of the drug that he himself was taking. 
     
      
    27 In particular, the public humiliation that has gone on for so many years for Mr Wilhelm can now be seen against the actual charge for which he is being sentenced, that is supply of a drug to a consenting adult who asked him to give it to her. Such a matter would hardly rate mention in any newspaper. Such a matter would hardly be the subject of any public concern, interest or derision. 
     
      
    28 It is, unfortunately, no doubt an incident that occurs frequently within the community to youngish people who are having a good time in social situations. May this be a lesson to any such persons that they know the consequences of what seems to be harmless and innocent but is criminal activity of supplying a person with a drug of such nature. 
     
      
    29 Mr Wilhelm will, I am quite sure, be dissuaded from ever involving himself in such conduct again, such were the consequences of this particular night and the way it has affected his whole life since then. 
     
      
    30 Deterrence is an important part of sentencing, particularly when the sentence of the offender will probably receive a degree of media interest. Therefore, he is a suitable case for general deterrence because so very frequently the Court imposes deterrent sentences upon people where that deterrence is of a theoretical nature rather than of a real effect. 
     
      
    31 But surely the consequences for Mr Wilhelm and what he has been through over the years must indicate to people of a like mind in the community that they may bear the overall consequences for their actions in relation to the use and supply of what are some times referred to as party drugs. 
     
      
    32 GHB is a dangerous drug, as are others such as ecstasy and those drugs that have been proscribed under the Act. Why are they proscribed is because they are dangerous as Mr Wilhelm will now understand until his dying day.  
     
      
    33 There is in my view no need to impose any further punishment on Mr Wilhelm. No punishment that I could give would be anything like the punishment that he has suffered over the years as a result of the activity of this night. 
     
      
    34 The Crown does not suggest that I should do anything more than place him on a good behaviour bond. That is, of course, clearly common sense. Again, if one strips away all of the consequences of this activity it seems to be an indicator of the very lowest criminality of the offence of supply that could be imagined. 
     
      
    35 I have been asked by defence counsel to dismiss that charge under s 10. I do not intend to do that, mainly because I think that might send a different message to members of the community. 
     
      
    36 It seems to me that taking into account everything now that has happened to Mr Wilhelm, the proper way to deal with the matter is to deal with it under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. That seems to me to be a section that has recently been added to the armoury of the sentencing court in such a case where the Court indicates that the charge was deserving of a conviction but one where it is deserving of no other punishment in the circumstances of the particular case. 
     
      
    37 I just want to make it clear, as I hope I have done, the limited criminality for which Mr Wilhelm is being sentenced and the severity of the extra-curial punishment that he has suffered as a result of what occurred on this particular night and the remorse that he has shown constantly from the very day after the death of Mrs Brimble, for the consequences of his conduct which he could in no way have foreseen even if he had been sober. 
     
      
    38 In those circumstances the offender is convicted under s 10A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. I impose no further penalty. 
     
      
    39 Mr Wilhelm, finally it has come to an end and you can get on, hopefully, with the rest of your life as best as you are able.

      JUDGMENT 
       
       
       
      HIS HONOUR: 
       
       
      (1) Introduction 
       
      
    1 In these proceedings against the State of New South Wales (“the State”), the plaintiff claims damages for wrongful imprisonment and, in the alternative, for assault and/or battery and trespass to the person. The factual matters subjacent to the claim were the subject of an Agreed Statement of Facts (Tab 1, Exhibit A). 
     
      
    2 Mr T A Game SC with Mr A P L Naylor of counsel appeared on behalf of the plaintiff. Mr G P Craddock SC with Ms S A Beckett of counsel appeared on behalf of the State. 
     
      
       
      Order pursuant to s.72, Civil Procedure Act 2005 re identity of the plaintiff 
       
      
    3 Mr Game raised the question as to whether the Court should exercise circumspection with respect to the matters raised in this judgment concerning matters personal to the plaintiff. Although he did not have specific instructions in this respect, he raised the matter in her interests. Mr Craddock, with respect quite properly, raised the question of power of the Court under s.72 and that, given the nature of the matters concerning the plaintiff, they might constitute a proper basis for the making of such an order. 
     
      
    4 Upon consideration, I have determined that an order should be made under s.72 with a view to prohibiting disclosure of any information tending to reveal the identity of the plaintiff. The approach to be taken, I consider, should be that the plaintiff is to be referred to, in this judgment, by initials which I consider will serve the same purpose as the use of a pseudonym. I accordingly make an order to that effect and additionally make a further order in terms of s.72 prohibiting disclosure of any information which tends to reveal the identity of the plaintiff. 
     
      
       
      Determination of the separate question on liability 
       
      
    5 On 26 February 2009, this Court made an order for liability, to be determined as a separate question.  
     
      
    6 The proceedings raise for consideration a significant question of law concerning the circumstances in which a mentally ill person may be detained following completion of a special hearing under s.19 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990 (“MH(CP) Act”) where:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The person concerned has been found, on the limited evidence adduced at such a hearing, to have committed an offence. 
       
       
      (2) A “ 
      limiting term” 
       has been nominated. 
       
       
      (3) An order has been made (as in this case) for the person’s detention in a  
      “hospital” 
      . 
       
      
    7 The principal question for determination is whether it was lawful for the plaintiff in the circumstances referred to in (1), (2) and (3) to be detained in a “prison” where the prison did not form part of a “hospital” within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1990 (“MH Act 1990”). In this case, the “prison” was Long Bay Prison Hospital. 
     
      
       
      (2) The plaintiff 
       
      
    8 The plaintiff was born on 5 December 1970. Accordingly, she was 31 years of age at the time of the relevant events. She is a “protected person” with the meaning of the Protected Estates Act 1983, she being a person under a legal incapacity within the meaning of the Civil Procedure Act 2005. Accordingly, the proceedings are brought on her behalf by her tutor, the Protective Commissioner of New South Wales, who has been so appointed under the Protected Estates Act.  
     
      
       
      (3) The pleadings 
       
      
    9 The proceedings have been pursued on the basis of the Second Further Amended Statement of Claim filed on 11 December 2009. The defence to those proceedings is contained in the Further Amended Defence filed on 9 February 2010. The amendment to the original defence raised a limitation defence under s.18A of the Limitation Act 1969 whereby it was pleaded that the whole of the plaintiff’s claims of wrongful imprisonment, assault and/or batter and trespass to the person are statute-barred. However, the limitation defence has not been pressed on the basis that the proceedings do not raise a claim for damages for personal injury. 
     
      
       
      (4) The applicable legislation 
       
      
    10 There have been changes in the relevant legislation since the events concerning the plaintiff’s detention in 2002 occurred. Since then, the MH Act 1990 has been repealed and replaced by the Mental Health Act 2007 (“MH Act 2007”). Additionally, the MH(CP) Act has been amended and renamed the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990 (“the MHFP Act”). 
     
      
    11 The provisions that were applicable to the events with which the present proceedings are concerned are as follows:- 
     
      
       
      (1) MH Act 1990 (version for 3 April 2000 to 3 July 2002), Chapters 1 to 3, Chapter 4 (Part 3), Chapter 5, Chapter 8 (Part 1, Division 1), Schedule 1; ss.3, 62, 66, 89 and 208, Schedule 1. 
       
       
      (2) MH(CP) Act (version for 1 January 2000 to 23 February 2003), ss.19, 22, 23, 24, 27, 28 and 29. 
       
      
    12 Many of the provisions of the current legislative scheme have similarities to the scheme as it existed under the 1990 Acts referred to above. In the submissions for the plaintiff, it was contended that whether it is lawful to detain a “forensic patient” in a “prison” or “correctional centre” where the person is the subject of an order that he or she be detained in a “hospital”, remains a pertinent question. 
     
      
       
      (5) The facts 
       
      
    13 The facts set out below are based upon the Agreed Statement of Facts in Exhibit A. 
     
      
       
      (a) The plaintiff 
       
      
    14 The plaintiff is a single Aboriginal woman who, at all material times, suffered form chronic schizophrenia and a mild to moderate developmental disability. 
     
      
       
      (b) The charges and fitness hearing 
       
      
    15 The plaintiff was arrested and charged with a robbery offence and, on or about 23 July 2001, she was indicted with respect to that charge. Following a fitness hearing under s.14 of the MH(CP) Act, she was found unfit to be tried on the charge and was referred to the Mental Health Review Tribunal for it to determine whether she would be fit to stand trial within the next 12 months. On 17 September 2001, the Tribunal determined that question in the negative. 
     
      
    16 On 27 November 2001, the plaintiff (on an amended indictment) was charged, in the alternative to the charge of robbery, with a charge of assault with intent to rob. On 28 November 2001, she was found to be unfit to be tried on the latter charge. Following referral to the Tribunal, it was determined that the plaintiff would not be fit to stand trial on the assault charge for a 12 month period from the date of the fitness hearing. 
     
      
       
      (c) The special hearing 
       
      
    17 On 7 February 2002, a special hearing under the MH(CP) Act was directed pursuant to s.18(a) of that Act in relation to the two abovementioned charges. 
     
      
    18 On 30 April and 1 May 2002, the District Court (his Honour, Woods DCJ), conducted a special hearing. On 1 May 2002, the plaintiff was found not guilty of the robbery charge but found, on the limited evidence available, that the plaintiff committed the offence of assault with intent to rob. 
     
      
       
      (d) The nomination of the “limiting term” 
       
      
    19 On 2 May 2002, Woods DCJ, pursuant to s.23 of the MH(CP) Act, nominated a “limiting term” of 20 months in relation to the assault offence, to commence on 24 November 2000 and to expire on 23 July 2002. Section 23(5) of the MH(CP) Act permitted a limiting term to be backdated.  
     
      
       
      (e) Interim order under s.24(1) 
       
      
    20 Woods DCJ also made an order under s.24(1) of the MH(CP) Act in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “IN ACCORDANCE WITH SECTION 24(1)(A) OF THE ACT, HIS HONOUR ORDERS THAT SHE BE REFERRED TO THE MENTAL HEALTH REVIEW TRIBUNAL. SHE IS TO BE DETAINED AT MULAWA CORRECTIONAL CENTRE. 
         
        HIS HONOUR DIRECTS THAT SHE NOT BE PLACED IN SEGREGATION AND THAT ANY PRESCRIBED MEDICATION IS NOT TO BE NEGLECTED.

      (f) The determination of the Mental Health Review Tribunal 
       
      
    21 On 30 May 2002, the Tribunal determined, pursuant to s.24(2) of the MH(CP) Act that the plaintiff was suffering from a mental illness (chronic schizophrenia) and that she was mildly to moderately intellectually disabled. 
     
      
       
      (g) The detention order made under s.27 of the MH(CP) Act 
       
      
    22 On 24 June 2002, Woods DCJ made the following order pursuant to s.27 of the MH(CP) Act:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…

        In accordance with section 27 of the said Act, I therefore order that  
        [TD] 
         be taken to and detained in a hospital 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
       
      (h) Additional facts 
       
      
    23 In the Agreed Statement of Facts, the following additional facts are set out:- 
     
      
       
        
        “22. On 1 July 2002, at the direction of officers, servants, agents and/or others in the service of the First Defendant, the Plaintiff was transferred from the Mulawa Correctional Centre to the Long Bay Prison Hospital to be detained. 
         
         
        23. From 1 July to 12 July 2002 inclusive (the ‘ 
        First Detention Period’ 
        ), 
          
        officers, servants and/or others in the service or employ of the First Defendant detained the Plaintiff in cell 16 of D Ward of the Long Bay Prison Hospital. 
         
         
        24. At all times during her detention in the Long Bay Prison Hospital during the First Detention Period, the Plaintiff was a ‘forensic patient’ within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1990. 
         
         
        25. On 12 July 2002, pursuant to section 89(1) of the Mental Health Act 1990, the MHRT re­classified the Plaintiff as a ‘continued treatment patient’ within the meaning of that Act. 
        
       
       
        
        26. On 12 July 2002, officers, servants, agents and/or others in the service of the First Defendant and the Second Defendant transferred the Plaintiff from the Long Bay Prison Hospital to the Rozelle Hospital 
         
         
        27. On 12 July 2002, at about 2.50pm, the Plaintiff absconded from the Rozelle Hospital. 
        
       
       
        
        28. During the afternoon or evening of 12 July 2002, the Plaintiff was located by officers of the New South Wales Police Force and returned to Rozelle Hospital. 
         
         
        29. During the evening of 12 July 2002, officers, servants, agents and/or persons in the service of the First Defendant (Department of Health) at the Rozelle Hospital refused the Plaintiff's re-admission to that hospital and directed that the Plaintiff be transferred to the Long Bay Prison Hospital. In particular, Dr Leonard Chin, Psychiatry Registrar of Rozelle Hospital, following a conversation with his Clinical Superintendent Dr Trenaman, signed a form (as delegate for the Medical Superintendent) purporting to facilitate the transfer of the Plaintiff from Rozelle Hospital to the Long Bay Prison Hospital pursuant to section 78 of the Mental Health Act 1990. 
         
         
        30. During the evening of 12 July 2002, at about 11.30pm, the Plaintiff was taken to the Long Bay Prison Hospital and detained in cell 16 of D Ward of that facility by officers, servants, agents and/or others in the service of the First Defendant. 
         
         
        31. From 12 July to 16 July 2002 (the  
        ‘Second Detention Period’ 
        ), 
          
        officers, servants, agents and/or others in the service of the First Defendant continued to detain the Plaintiff in cell 16 of D Ward of the Long Bay Prison Hospital. 
         
         
        32. On 16 July 2002, at about 6.30pm, the Plaintiff was discharged from the Long Bay Prison Hospital and taken to the Edgar Eager Lodge in Darlinghurst where a placement had been found for her. 
         
         
        33. During both the First Detention Period and the Second Detention Period, the Long Bay Prison Hospital was a ‘prison’ within the meaning of the Mental Health Act 1990 and a ‘correctional centre’ within the meaning of the Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Act 1990  
        (‘CAS Act’ 
        ). 
          
        In particular, the Long Bay Prison Hospital was the subject of a declaration made pursuant to section 225 of the CAS Act that it be a ‘correctional centre’ within the meaning of that Act or the Correctional Centres Act 1952. 
         
         
        34. On 4 June 1999 there was published in the NSW Government Gazette, No. 66, an order by the Director-General of the Department of Health declaring beds 1-15, only, of the East Wing of D Ward, Long Bay Prison Hospital, to be a ""hospital"" pursuant to section 208 of the Mental Health Act 1990. During both the First Detention Period and the Second Detention Period, cell 16 within D Ward did not form part of a ‘hospital’ within the meaning of the MH(CP) Act or the Mental Health Act 1990. 
        
       
       
        
        35. During both the First Detention Period and the Second Detention Period, cell 16 of the Long Bay Prison Hospital was under the control of the First Defendant. 
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
          
        
       
      (i) The meaning of “hospital” 
       
      
    24 In the written submissions for the plaintiff dated 2 June 2009, the following additional matters are set out:- 
     
      
       
        
        “20. Section 3 of the MH(CP) Act provided that ‘ 
        hospital 
         has the same meaning as in the Mental Health Act 1990’. 
        
       
       
        
        21. Section 3 and Schedule of the MH Act defined ‘hospital’ to mean: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ‘(a) any premises the subject of an order in force under section 208 by which the premises are declared to be a hospital, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) an authorised hospital.’ 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        22. An ‘authorised hospital’ was defined to mean premises in respect of which a licence had been granted under Division 1 of Part 1 of Chapter 8. The Long Bay Prison Hospital was not such a hospital. Rather, it was a hospital which was the subject of an order in force under s.208 of the MH Act 1990. 
        
       
       
        
        23. Section 208 of the MH Act 1990 provided:- 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ‘(1) The Director General, by order published in the Gazette:

              (b) a public hospital within the meaning of the Health Services Act 1997, and 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              (c) (Repealed) 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
             
              
              (d) where the person to whom premises belong or who has control of premises, by an instrument in writing given to the Director-General, agreed to the premises being premises to which this section applies – those premises.’ 
              
             
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        24. The ‘Director-General’ was defined to mean the Director-General of the Department of Health: MH Act 1990, Schedule 1. 
         
         
        25. Between 7 December 2001 and 19 September 2002, s.15 of the Health Services Act 1997 defined ‘public hospital’ to relevantly mean: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ‘(a) … 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (b) a hospital controlled by a statutory health corporation, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (c) … 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (d) a hospital controlled by the Crown (including the Minister or the Health Administration Corporation).’ 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        26. Section 41 and Schedule 2 of the Health Services Act had the effect that the Corrections Health Service (CHS) was a statutory health corporation. The CHS has since been re-named Justice Health. 
        
       
       
        
        27. The CHS (as it then was) controlled the Long Bay Prison Hospital and was responsible for the provisions of healthcare services to persons detained therein, including D Ward. 
        
       
       
        
        28. On 4 June 1999, the New South Wales Government Gazette (No. 66) published a declaration made by the Director General of the NSW Department of Health pursuant to s.208 of the MH Act, to the effect that the following premises within Long Bay Prison Hospital were declared to be a hospital for the purposes of the MH Act, specifically: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            ‘Ward A; 
             
            Ward C, beds 1 to 15 in the East Wing, only; and 
             
            Ward D, beds 1 to 15 in the East Wong, only.’ 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
        29. The declaration did not extend to bed (or cell) 16 of D Ward.” 
        
       
      
    25 After the plaintiff absconded from Rozelle Hospital, she was found by police and returned to that hospital, she was subsequently transferred back to Long Bay Prison Hospital. She remained in cell 16 until 16 July 2002 when she was transferred to the Edgar Eager Lodge. 
     
      
       
      (6) Plaintiff’s submissions 
       
      
    26 The nature and operation of an order made under s.27 of the MH(CP) Act occupied a central place in the plaintiff’s submissions. 
     
      
    27 As stated above, an order made under that section follows a determination of the Tribunal which, in turn, is made after a limiting term has been nominated by the Court under s.23(1) of the MH(CP) Act. The nomination of a limiting term permitted a Court to “make such order with respect to the custody of the person as the Court considers appropriate”: s.24(1)(b). An order was made under the latter section in this case. Such an order, as discussed below, is in the nature of an interim order. 
     
      
    28 An order subsequently made under s.27(a) of the MH(CP) Act (namely, that the person “be taken to and detained in a hospital”) was said by the plaintiff to have two effects. Firstly, it caused the earlier order made under s.24(1)(b) with respect to the custody of the plaintiff in Mulawa Correctional Centre (the interim order), to become spent. Secondly, the making of the order pursuant to s.27(a) had the effect that the plaintiff became a “forensic patient” within the meaning of the MH Act 1990. 
     
      
    29 The plaintiff’s submissions addressed specific matters concerning the two relevant periods of detention as follows 
     
      
       
      (a) First period of detention in Long Bay Prison Hospital 
       
      
    30 The first period extended for 12 days between 1 to 12 July 2002. On 1 July 2002, the plaintiff was transferred from Mulawa Correctional Centre to the Long Bay Prison Hospital and was there placed in and detained in cell 16 of D Ward.  
     
      
    31 The submission for the plaintiff was that it was unlawful for the plaintiff to be detained in cell 16 of D Ward because that cell did not form part of a “hospital” within the meaning of the MH Act 1990. As the order made by Woods DCJ pursuant to s.27(a) on 24 June 2002 required the plaintiff’s detention in a “hospital” within the meaning of the MH(CP) Act, it was contended her detention in cell 16 of D Ward was in breach of that order. The State’s submissions acknowledge that her detention in cell 16 of D Ward was in breach of the order made by Woods DCJ under s.27 on 24 June 2002. 
     
      
    32 It was further argued, that the “unlawful detention” was caused by the servants or agents of the State. That responsibility, it was alleged, was shared by the Governor of the Long Bay Prison Hospital, the Department of Corrective Services and the Department of Health: [46] of the Plaintiff’s Written Submissions. 
     
      
    33 That said, Mr Game stated that, on the question of vicarious liability, there was no need for the Court to determine which of the group of departmental officers was liable (if liability is established). The parties had agreed that it would not be necessary for the Court hearing the proceedings to determine which particular officers’ actions gave rise to the alleged liability (transcript, 15 March 2010, p.6). 
     
      
    34 It was contended for the plaintiff, that the alleged unlawful detention alternatively constituted a trespass to the person. The primary case presented, however, was based on false imprisonment. In addition, or in the alternative, the plaintiff’s detention was said to be capable of being characterised as an assault and/or battery. 
     
      
    35 In the course of his oral submissions, Mr Game referred to documentation to be found behind Tab 17 of the tender bundle, Exhibit A. The documentation related to specific factual matters that arose during the course of the plaintiff’s detention. I set out below a brief summary in relation to such material: 
     
      
       
      (1) On 1 July 2002, the Director of the Centre for Mental Health wrote to Mr Richard Mendon of the Mental Health Advocacy Service advising that arrangements  
      “… have been made for your client to be transferred to the Long Bay Prison Hospital pending assessment by The Rozelle Hospital Forensic Admission Team as to  
      (the plaintiff’s) 
       suitability for admission” 
      . 
       
       
      (2) On 1 July 2002 (Tab 17 of the tender bundle), the relevant entry recorded the fact that the plaintiff did not know that she was going to Long Bay Hospital but thought she was going to Rozelle and was feeling  
      “a bit scared because of other male inmates” 
      . Mr Game noted that the plaintiff was confined in a male prison hospital. 
       
       
      (3) On 2 July 2002, a note was made that the plaintiff believed that she was being transferred from Mulawa to Rozelle and was unhappy with the transfer to D Ward but was  
      “… resigned to same” 
      : Tab 17, p.48. 
       
       
      (4) On 2 July 2002, there was reference to Aboriginal Services visiting the plaintiff the next day with a view to  
      “… ‘celebrating’ her Aboriginality in D Ward” 
       (Tab 17, p.51). 
       
       
      (5) On 4 July 2002,  
      “… reports feeling distressed and wanting to return to Mulawa …” 
      . Reference was also made to protection inmates  
      “… masturbating in her presence whilst on exercise” 
       (Tab 17, p.53). 
       
       
      (6) On 5 July 2002, there was reference to a proposed transfer of the plaintiff being cancelled and reference to  
      “Section 27 ordering  
      [the plaintiff] 
       to be detained in a Hospital.  
      [Plaintiff] 
       extremely upset with same – screaming & crying …” 
       (Tab 17, p.54). 
       
       
      (7) On 5 July 2002 (Tab 17, p.55):- 
       
       
        
         
          
          “[Plaintiff] 
           is here on  
          COURT ORDER 
           Her transfer elsewhere, even if back to Mulawa can only be effected by rescinding the order ie Judge has to reverse order. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          LBH 
           was the only hospital flexible enough to accommodate her. Other alternatives are:- 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          1. Rozelle – when Rehab comes to assess and accept her. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          2. Back to Mulawa if Court reverses the order.” 
          
         
        
       
       
      (8) On 7 July 2002,  
      “… Becoming increasingly distressed re having to return to her cell at 1630 hrs. when male pts. came into the ward, noisy, abusive, tearful and generally disruptive, threatening to self-harm etc. Eventually given ‘time out’ …” 
       (Tab 17, p.58). 
       
       
      (9) On 8 July 2002,  
      “ 
      [Plaintiff] 
       expressed her distress at being in D Ward. I have spoken with Richard Mendon (MHAS) and he has requested an urgent MHRT r/v of  
      [plaintiff’s] 
       ‘inappropriate placement’ …” 
       (Tab 17, p.59). 
       
       
      (10) On 10 July 2002,  
      “10.30 am:  
      [plaintiff] 
       complained of feeling distressed and upset by the incident that occurred on the ward. She stated she was concerned about her safety …” 
       (Tab 17, p.62). 
       
       
      (b) Second period of the plaintiff’s detention 
       
      
    36 In accordance with the agreed statement of facts, the second detention period extended from 12 July to 16 July 2002. In this period it is said that the plaintiff was detained in cell 16 of D Ward of the Long Bay Prison Hospital. 
     
      
    37 The Long Bay Prison Hospital notes for that period are behind Tab 27 of Exhibit A. When the plaintiff was taken by police back to Rozelle after she absconded at approximately 8.00 pm on 12 July 2002, she was, according to nursing notes, returned to D Ward at about 11.30 pm. A file note of 15 July 2002 behind Tab 27 of Exhibit A recorded that “Gowan Wise was very concerned about the plaintiff’s placement in ‘male CC’ and that the plaintiff said that she wanted to be transferred to Mulawa”. The note records “for discharge today”. The plaintiff was, in fact, discharged and taken to the Edgar Eager Lodge. 
     
      
       
      (7) Submissions on behalf of the defendant 
       
      
    38 The State relied upon Written Outline of Submissions for the Defendant dated 9 February 2010. These were supplemented by oral submissions made on 15 March 2010. 
     
      
    39 Whilst the State admitted the plaintiff was detained, it asserted the detention was lawful. It was submitted that the defendant “… was obliged to detain the plaintiff pursuant to the limiting terms nominated by the District Court: Further Amended Defence [4] …”. 
     
      
    40 Similarly, in oral submissions on behalf of the State, it was contended that the limiting terms “… (had) the effect of denying a person’s liberty …” (transcript, 15 March 2010, p.27). It was also submitted that the power to order detention was “… a necessary consequence of the limiting term …” (t.28, lines 46 to 47; t.35, lines 18 to 19). 
     
      
    41 This point was reinforced by the contention that the discretion in a court under s.27 did not enable a judge to order that there be no detention (t.33, lines 35 to 37). 
     
      
    42 In the Outline of Submissions for the Defendant, it was contended:- 
     
      
       
        
        “9. The tort of wrongful imprisonment can only be understood by reference to the right which it seeks to protect: the right to liberty. In essence, the defendant’s position is that the right to liberty is removed when a limiting term is set and a custodial order made: ss.23(1), 24(1)(b), 27 of the Mental Health (Criminal Procedure) Act 1990. A limiting term may only be set following a finding that, on the limited evidence available, a person has committed the offence charged: ss.22(1)(c), 23(1).” 
        
       
      
    43 The contention for the State was that, in fact, the plaintiff’s liberty had been lawfully denied her (following the nomination of a limiting term and the making of a custodial order). Accordingly, she had no right that could be vindicated by resort to the law concerning wrongful imprisonment. In this respect, it was noted “… there is no doctrine of residual liberty which allows for a person lawfully detained to seek damages for wrongful imprisonment with respect to the circumstances of detention”: Regina v Deputy-Governor of Parkhurst Prison, ex parte Hague [1992] 1 AC 58, 162: Outline of Submissions for the Defendant, [10]. 
     
      
    44 It was further contended on behalf of the State (Outline of Submissions for the Defendant, [11]):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… She  
        [the plaintiff] 
         was forced to serve her detention in a non-gazetted hospital, not a gazetted hospital. That argument concerns the conditions that she was placed under, not the denial of liability  
        per se 
        . A breach of a right not to be subjected to certain conditions goes not to the legality of the deprivation of liberty in gaol but to the manner of confinement:  
        Hague 
         at 165F …” 
        
       
      
    45 In relation to the operation and effect of an order made under s.27, it was submitted for the State:- 
     
      
       
        
        “30. There is nothing in the scheme of the MH(CP) Act which permits of the possibility of the person being released under s.27(a) or (b). Detention in a hospital or prison or other place are exclusive alternatives.” 
        
       
      
    46 I note, at this point, that this latter submission not only does not find support in authority, but is contrary to the construction of s.27(b) adopted in Regina v AN (No 2) (2006) 66 NSWLR 523. The judgment of James J in that case (with whom Simpson and Rothman JJ agreed) is discussed below. That case involved an appeal which required the Court of Criminal Appeal to consider whether it should make an order under s.24(1)(b) of the MH(CP) Act that the applicant be detained in a specified Juvenile Justice Detention Centre and make an order pursuant to s.27(b) of the MH(CP) Act.  
     
      
    47 The submissions made on behalf of the State concerning limiting terms made under s.23 of the Act included a submission that the observations of Sperling J in Regina v Adams (2003) 58 NSWLR 1 at [31] concerning the use of the word “may” in s.27 was erroneous. However, the criticism of those observations cannot be regarded as valid, having regard to the construction placed on the section by James J in AN (No 2) (supra). 
     
      
    48 For the same reason, the submission made on behalf of the State in the Outline of Submissions for the Defendant that “All limiting term detainees must be the subject of either a hospital order under s.27 or another form of order under s.27” cannot be accepted as correct, having regard to the decision of the Court of Criminal appeal in AN (No 2) (supra). 
     
      
       
      (8) The tort of false imprisonment 
       
      
    49 Before considering the relevant statutory provisions pertaining to the plaintiff, the following common law principles may be noted:- 
     
      
       
      (1) The tort of false imprisonment has two elements. First, the fact of imprisonment and, second, the absence of lawful authority to justify it:  
      Hague  
      (supra). 
       
       
      (2) The plaintiff has the onus of proof in relation to the fact of imprisonment:  
      Cubillo v Commonwealth of Australia 
       [2001] FCA 1213, per Sackville, Weinberg and Hely JJ at [262]. The defendant has the onus of proof to show that the imprisonment was lawfully justified:  
      Ruddock v Taylor 
       [2005] HCA 48 at [97] per Gleeson CJ, Gummow, Hayne and Heydon JJ;  
      Cubillo v Commonwealth of Australia 
       [2000] FCA 1084 at [1150] 
       
       
      (3) It has been observed that it is not necessary to prove fault on the part of a defendant and in that sense the tort of false imprisonment is a tort of strict liability:  
      Regina v Governor of Brockhill Prison; ex parte Evans (No 2) 
       [2000] 3 WLR 843, 847. The tort, in other words, may be committed even though a defendant acted in good faith. In  
      Watson v Marshall v Marshall & Cade 
       (1971) 124 CLR 612, Walsh J (at 63) noted in the circumstances of that case that, although the defendant (a member of the Victorian Police Force) had acted in good faith and had believed that he was entitled to do what he did in detaining a person as a patient in a hospital and that it was right to do so, stated,  
      “… but this belief is irrelevant, in my opinion, to his responsibility in law for acts which were prima facie an infringement of the plaintiff’s rights, although it is highly relevant to the amount of damages which should be awarded …” 
       
       
      (4) In relation to statutory authorisations, in the interpretation of an Act which affects personal liberty, supposition as to the intention of the legislature has no place and the function of the Court is limited to interpreting and giving effect to its will as expressed in the statute:  
      Watson  
      (supra) at 629 per Walsh J. 
       
       
      (5) A power or authorisation to detain a person may be conferred for quite different purposes. In some contexts, such a power may have a punitive purpose. In others (eg, in the case of an immigration detention involving the power to detain unlawful non-citizens), the purpose of depriving a detainee of his or her liberty is not a form of punishment. See for example,  
      Behrooz v Secretary, Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs 
       (2004) 219 CLR 486, 499 per Gleeson CJ and Kirby J at 528. 
       
       
      (9) Special hearings and the nomination of limiting terms 
       
      
    50 Part 2 of the MH(CP) Act at the relevant time, as in the equivalent current legislation, contained provisions, inter alia, concerned with the basis or bases for and the procedure for the determination of a person’s unfitness to be tried. It also contained provisions concerning the functions of the Mental Health Review Tribunal on referral after inquiry, the holding of a “special hearing” and the nature and conduct of such hearing. 
     
      
    51 Sections 23 to 27 are of particular relevance to the present proceedings.  
     
      
    52 In a sense it could be said that the statutory scheme under the above Act, including in particular, s.23, s.24 and s.27 is, inter alia, a protective scheme so far as the rights of a mentally-ill person dealt with under the Act are concerned. 
     
      
       
      (a) Section 23 – nominating terms 
       
      
    53 Section 23 deals with a Court’s function following the completion of a special hearing:- 
     
      
       
        
        “23(1) If, following a special hearing, it is found on the limited evidence available that an accused person committed the offence charged or some other offence available as an alternative, the Court: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) must indicate whether, if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for the offence which the person is found to have committed, it would have imposed a sentence of imprisonment, and 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) where the Court would have imposed such a sentence,  
          must nominate a term in this section referred to as 
            
          a limiting term 
          , in respect of that offence, being the vest estimate of the sentence the Court would have considered appropriate if the special hearing had been a normal trial of criminal proceedings against a person who was fit to be tried for that offence and the person had been found guilty of that offence. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
        (2) If a Court indicates that it would not have imposed a sentence of imprisonment in respect of a person, the Court may impose any other penalty or make any other order it might have made on conviction of the person for the relevant offence in a normal trial of criminal proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        (3) Any such other penalty imposed or order made, under subsection (2), is to be subject to appeal in the same manner as a penalty or order in a normal trial of criminal proceedings. 
        
       
       
        
        (4) In nominating a limiting term in respect of a person or imposing any other penalty or making any other order, the Court may, if it thinks fit, take into account the periods, if any, of the person’s custody or detention before, during an dafter the special hearing (being periods related to the offence). 
        
       
       
        
        (5)  
        A limiting term nominated in respect of a person takes effect from the time when it is nominated unless the Court, after taking into account the periods, if any, of the person’s custody or detention before, during and after the special hearing (being periods related to the offence), directs that the term be taken to have commenced at an earlier time. 
        ”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    54 Section 23(1)(b), accordingly, empowers the Court to impose in the circumstances specified a limiting term that is equivalent to the sentence that it would have imposed had the person been convicted of the offence following a normal trial. It has been observed that s.23 does not, itself, contain any provision requiring that the accused person be detained in custody during the limiting term nominated: AN (No 2) per James J at [26], 528. 
     
      
    55 It was also there observed that it is unclear whether the nominating of a limiting term can be regarded as amounting to the imposition of a penalty at [32]. 
     
      
    56 Whilst a limiting term is a sentence for the purposes of s.5(1)(c) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 by reason of the definition of “sentence” in s.2 of that Act, it, of course, does not follow that a limiting term is to be considered as the equivalent of a sentence of imprisonment or penalty. The power of the Court of Criminal Appeal to grant leave to appeal against a limiting term was considered in Regina v AN [2005] NSWCCA 239 at 2 per Howie J. 
     
      
    57 Section 23 does not, upon the nomination of a limiting term (as observed in AN (No 2) (supra) at [26]), require that a person be detained in custody. 
     
      
    58 The detention of a person in respect of whom a limiting term is nominated depends upon the Court making orders as authorised by s.24(1)(b) and s.27.  
     
      
       
      (b) Section 24 orders 
       
      
    59 The Court is authorised to make an order “with respect to the custody of the person as the Court considers appropriate”: s.24(1)(b). 
     
      
    60 The Tribunal, following a referral from the Court under s.24(1)(a), must proceed to make a determination in accordance with s.24(2). 
     
      
    61 The s.24(1)(b) order made by Woods DCJ on 2 May 2002 (the “interim order”) specified and required the plaintiff to be detained in a correctional institution (Mulawa). The s.27 order, which was subsequently made by Woods DCJ, imposed what, for convenience, may be termed a hospital detention in the sense discussed above, that is, a detention in a proclaimed or declared “hospital”, not in a correctional institution. A consequence of the s.27 order, as discussed above, was that the plaintiff acquired the status of a “forensic patient”. 
     
      
    62 Section 24 entitled, Consequences of nomination of limiting term, provided for the making of an order with respect to the custody of the person “as the Court considers appropriate”: s.24(1)(b). An order made pursuant to the latter provision is in the nature of an interim order and has been so described in AN (No 2) (supra) at [23]. See also Mailes v Director of Public Prosecutions & Mental Health Review Tribunal [2006] NSWSC 267 per RS Hulme J at [28] to [20]. 
     
      
    63 Accordingly, the source of the power to detain an accused person comes, not from provisions empowering the Court to nominate a limiting term (s.23), but, as a form of interim order, from the terms of s.24(1)(b) following a nomination of the limiting term. 
     
      
    64 The position of an accused person’s liberty or detention arises, once again for consideration, once the Court has been notified by the Tribunal of its determination in respect of a person under s.24(3). It is important in the resolution of liability in the present case for the Court’s jurisdiction and power under s.27 to be carefully scrutinised. 
     
      
       
      (c) Section 27 orders 
       
      
    65 The provisions of s.27 are critical to the issue of liability. The section comes into operation following upon the determination by the Tribunal after a limiting term is imposed. Following notification by the Tribunal to the Court of its determination in respect of a person under s.24(3), the issue of the person’s detention or otherwise will be determined by order of the Court. Under s.27, the Court may:- 
     
      
       
        
        “27.  
        Orders Court may make following determination of Mental Health Review Tribunal after limiting term is imposed 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          If a Court is notified by the Mental Health Review Tribunal of it determination in respect of a person under s.24(3), the Court may:- 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) if the Tribunal has determined that the person is suffering from mental illness or that the person is suffering form a mental condition for which treatment is available in a hospital and that the person, not being in a hospital, does not object to being detained in a hospital – order that the person be taken to and detained  
          in a hospital 
          , or 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) if the Tribunal has determined that the person is not suffering from mental illness or from a mental condition referred to in paragraph (1) or that the person is suffering from such a mental condition but that the person objects to being detained in a hospital – order that the person be detained  
          in a place other than a hospital 
          .” ( 
          emphasis added) 
          
         
        
       
      
    66 The order made by Woods DCJ on 24 June 2002 under s.27 was expressed to be made upon the basis of the Tribunal’s notification under s.24(3), namely, that the plaintiff “is a person suffering from a mental illness”. It directed that the plaintiff’s detention be one “in a hospital”. That order was made under s.27(a). Section 3 of the MH(CP) Act provided that “hospital has the same meaning as in the Mental Health Act 1990”. 
     
      
    67 Section 3 and the Schedule to the MH Act 1990 defined “hospital” to mean:- 
     
      
       
        
        “(a) Any premises the subject of an order in force under s.208 by which the premises are declared to be a hospital; or 
        
       
       
        
        (b) An authorised hospital.” 
        
       
      
    68 The relevant declarations made by the Director General of the New South Wales Department of Health pursuant to s.208 of the MH Act 1990 (published on 4 June 1999), as earlier noted, declared the following premises within Long Bay Prison Hospital, a “hospital” for the purposes of the MH Act 1990:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Ward A 
        
       
       
        
        Ward C, beds 1 to 15 in the East Wing only, and 
        
       
       
        
        Ward D, best 1 to 15 in the East Wing only.” 
        
       
      
    69 The declaration did not extend to bed (or cell) 16 of Ward D. 
     
      
    70 I accept the submission for the plaintiff that the word “hospital” in s.27(a) of the MH(CP) Act is not interchangeable with the word “prison”. Both words, as observed in the plaintiff’s submissions, are used in the MH(CP) Act, eg, s.35 Transfer of prisoners. 
     
      
    71 In AN (No 2) (supra), James J noted, at [47], that the language of the crucial part of s.27, namely, “the court may … order that the person be detained in a place other than a hospital” is open to the interpretation either that the section confers a power to order both detention and a place of detention or the interpretation that s.27(b) merely confers a power to order a place of detention. 
     
      
    72 In that respect, James J observed at [48]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, s.27(b), on its proper interpretation, confers a power to order that a person be detained, as well as a power to determine where the person should be detained …” 
        
       
      
    73 James J set forth his reasons for reaching that conclusion. His Honour, firstly, referred to the definition of “forensic patient” in the Dictionary in Schedule 1 to the MH Act 1990 which is defined as meaning “(a) A person who is detained in a hospital, prison or other place … pursuant to an order” under certain sections of the MH(CP) Act which includes s.27 but which did not include s.24. 
     
      
    74 His Honour referred to the observations of RS Hulme J in Mailes (supra) in which his Honour held that a person detained pursuant to an order under s.24 of the Act is not a forensic patient. That conclusion followed from the terms of the definition of “forensic patient” with which James J agreed. 
     
      
    75 If a person did become a forensic patient, which would happen if an order is made under s.27, James J observed that Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the MH Act 1990 then became applicable. 
     
      
    76 Section 80, in that Part, prescribes the power of the Tribunal to review cases of persons found unfit to be tried. Section 82 conferred power in the Tribunal, at least every six months, to review cases of forensic patients whilst s.83 was concerned with notice of recommended releases. 
     
      
    77 Following reference to those provisions, James J continued at [53] and [54]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “53. It would seem to me odd, if a person’s becoming a forensic patient and becoming subject to the elaborate review provisions in Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the Mental Health Act could depend on the making of an order which  
        merely provided for the place 
         in which a person should be detained, as distinct from  
        an order providing for the person’s detention 
        . 
        
       
       
        
        54. Furthermore, it would make good sense for a court to have power under s.27 to decide what order should be made for the person’s future custody or detention. Even if the court has made an order under s.24(1)(b) with respect to the custody of the person, which the court, in the light of the information it then had available to it, considered to be appropriate, the court, by the time it considers  
        what order (if any) it should make under s.27 of the Act 
        , will have received the determination made by the Mental Health Tribunal pursuant to s.24(2) and is, accordingly, likely to have further information about the person in question.”  
        (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    78 A little later in the judgment, James J stated:- 
     
      
       
        
        “56. I conclude that the Court can now make an order under s.27(b) of the Act for the detention of the applicant and not merely an order providing for the place in which any detention of the applicant should occur.” 
        
       
      
    79 Accordingly, an order made by a court under s.27 is an order that operates in respect of the person’s liberty in terms of a detention duly authorised by the order. The section is the source of the power to decide what order should be made for a person’s future custody or detention. It is that order, following receipt by the Court of a notification by the Tribunal of its determination in respect of a person under s.24(3), which will determine both the question as to whether the person is detained and, if made, the place at which the detention is to occur. 
     
      
    80 A related matter of particular relevance to the present case is whether or not the statutory scheme under the MH(CP) Act, in particular, the above provisions that confer the power to make detention orders (s.27(a) and (b)), vests in the Court a discretion not to make an order under s.27(a) or (b) or whether the Court is confined, in its discretion, to ordering detention in a hospital or in a place other than a hospital and not a power to make no order under either s.27(a) or (b). 
     
      
    81 That was a matter that arose for decision in AN (No 2) (supra). James J observed that if no order is made under s.27(b) and if there was no continuing order under s.24(1)(b), the applicant in that case would have been entitled to be released, there being no warrant for his being held in custody. 
     
      
    82 On that question his Honour observed that, in certain provisions of the Act, the legislature used the word “must” where it intended to confer a power which the donee of the power would be obliged to exercise. Other provisions where the legislature intended to confer a power which the donee of the power might, at its discretion, exercise or not exercise, the legislature used the word “may”: see [60]. 
     
      
    83 James J observed that, such little authority as existed, supported the view that a court has a discretion whether to make an order under s.27(b). His Honour, in that respect, referred to the observations of Sperling J in Adams (supra) at 14, [31]. Following reference also to the decision of Regina v Tas (District Court, Keleman DCJ, 1 October 1997, unreported) and the remarks on sentence of Mathews J Regina v Boyle (18 September 1992, unreported), his Honour stated at [62]:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In my opinion, it is possible to conceive of circumstances in which it would be appropriate not to make any order under s.27. An example might be the circumstances in Regina v Boyle …” 
        
       
      
    84 In this latter respect, reference was made to the fact that the circumstances in that case were such that there may be no point in causing the review procedures in Part 2 of Chapter 5 of the MH Act 1990 to become applicable to the offender. 
     
      
    85 In AN (No 2) (supra), the Court of Criminal Appeal proceeded upon the basis that it was in the position of determining whether or not an order should be made under s.27(b). James J, having noted at [77] that, if the Court did not make any order under that provision, the applicant would be entitled to be released, ultimately concluded that, as a matter of discretion, it was open to the Court to order the applicant to be detained in a juvenile justice detention centre and that the Court should make an order to that effect. 
     
      
    86 I am of the opinion that, in light of the abovementioned authorities, the proper construction of s.27 is that the Court has a discretion as to whether to make an order in terms of s.27(a) or (b) or not to make an order for detention under either provision. As noted above, in the latter event, the person concerned (the plaintiff in the present proceedings) would be entitled to be released. 
     
      
    87 In the light of that conclusion, I do not accept the contention made on behalf of the State as to the asserted consequences of the nomination of a limiting term. I also do not accept the submission made as to the limited nature of the discretion said to exist under s.27. In that latter respect, it was contended (t.35):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… The way that limiting term works, it’s a little hard to construe the possibility of any residual discretion in a judge to do other than simply choose the place of custody when making a determination under s.27. Which brings us back to … the question that’s really only theoretical, which is whether the limiting term of itself has the effect of denying liberty. We say it does.” 
        
       
      
    88 With respect, that contention runs contrary to the construction that has been adopted in the authorities concerning s.23, s.24 and s.27 of the MH(CP) Act to which reference has been made above. 
     
      
    89 The terms of the order made by Woods DCJ in this case under s.27, of course, was the source of the power to detain and then within the limitations prescribed by it. By that order, the only lawful authority it conveyed was for the plaintiff’s detention in a “hospital” (as defined by law). 
     
      
    90 In asking then what did the order of Woods DCJ authorise – detention in a “prison” or detention in a “hospital” as defined, the answer is clearly the latter and not the former. The order neither expressly nor impliedly authorised the plaintiff to be lawfully detained in a prison (a place that could have been authorised only under s.27(b)). The detention was to be, and only to be, on premises that were specified in or as declared in an order made under s.208 of the MH Act 1990 and published in the Gazette.  
     
      
    91 In relation to the question of lawful detention, there has long been recognised a distinction between the place and/or nature of confinement, imprisonment or detention and the conditions of confinement, imprisonment etc. 
     
      
    92 In Collins v Downs (unreported, 14December 1982), Roden J stated at 5:- 
     
      
       
        
        “In  
        Arbon v Anderson 
         … in which earlier authority such as  
        Cobbett v Grey 
         (1849) 4 Ex 729 and  
        Osborne v Millman 
         (1886) 17 QBD 14 were considered, what appears to be a significant distinction was made between, on the one hand, the nature or place of imprisonment, and on the other, the conditions of imprisonment. This, I believe, is an important distinction to bear in mind when considering the other cause of action pleaded here by the plaintiff.” 
        
       
      
    93 Roden J then went on to deal with the plaintiff’s case based on false imprisonment in that case (at 5):- 
     
      
       
        
        “… I earlier referred, that there is a right of action for false imprisonment available to a  
        [sic]  
        convict prisoner if, during the term of the sentence imposed upon him when his imprisonment or otherwise would be lawful, he is wrongly subjected to imprisonment of a nature or in a place not authorised. In this regard, the distinction mentioned above between nature or place of the imprisonment and the conditions of imprisonment is, I believe, critical.” 
        
       
       
      Conclusions 
       
      
    94 At the time of the making of the order under s.27, the plaintiff had not, by reason of the limiting term, been deprived of her right to liberty. The order made under s.24 was not a final order but was an interim order. Her detention, its nature and place for the period of the limiting term was determined at the point in time at which the power under s.27 was exercised by the District Court. 
     
      
    95 In other words, the order made by Woods DCJ was both an order for the plaintiff’s detention and an order that specified both the nature and the place of the plaintiff’s detention (“a hospital”). It did not authorise her detention in any other place that could have been ordered under s.27(b). The distinction between a place that is a “hospital” as declared and some other place is, of course, one of importance, not only from the perspective of the treatment of a person with mental illness but as a matter of law in determining what constitutes lawful detention. 
     
      
    96 In this case on the agreed facts, the relevant provisions of the MH(CP) Act and the terms of the s.27 order, I have concluded that the plaintiff’s detention in cell 16 of D Ward was without legal justification. The detention was one in breach of the order made under s.27 of the MH(CP) Act and, accordingly, was not authorised as a matter of law. The detention constituted an infringement of her rights including the right to be free of unlawful restraint. 
     
      
    97 On the findings to which I have referred, the plaintiff has established that the State is liable on the cause of action pleaded, false imprisonment, and I propose to order judgment on that basis in her favour. 
     
      
    98 In relation to the plaintiff’s pleaded causes of action for assault and/or battery and trespass to the person, as indicated above, those causes of actions were pleaded in the alternative not cumulatively to the plaintiff’s primary case for wrongful imprisonment. In the course of his oral submissions, Mr Game stated that the causes of action for assault and battery and for trespass to the person had been pleaded more as “an abundance of caution” on the basis stated by him (transcript, 15 March 2010, p.19). I will, however, briefly refer to the competing submissions made on the alternative counts. 
     
      
    99 Reliance in respect to those alternative causes of action was placed upon the Supplementary Written Submissions on behalf of the Plaintiff dated 20 November 2009 at paragraphs [15] to [22]. Paragraph [18] of those submissions, is in the following terms:- 
     
      
       
        
        “18. It is submitted, in addition to and/or in the alternative to the false imprisonment claim, that the Plaintiff was assaulted and/or battered when she was required to be detained in cell 16 of D Ward of the Long Bay Prison Hospital. The Plaintiff was assaulted in that she reasonably apprehended imminent physical interference to compel her return to her cell if she was non-compliant with directions. Alternatively, if there was physical contact in the process whereby the Plaintiff was escorted or placed in her cell, it was battery.” 
        
       
      
    100 In the written submissions, reference was made to an extract from the clinical notes for 7 July 2002 between 0700 and 2100. It was stated that the entry made it clear that there was a requirement for the plaintiff to be detained in her cell whilst at Long Bay Prison Hospital. 
     
      
    101 It was further submitted for the plaintiff that the Court would “infer that physical interference with the Plaintiff was used or impliedly threatened in escorting the Plaintiff to her cell. Any actual physical interference constituted a battery. If there was no actual physical interference but it was threatened, whether expressly or impliedly, it was an assault. It is submitted that the Court may infer an implied threat from the circumstances …”. It was also contended that the plaintiff did not consent to any physical interference nor was there another lawful justification for any physical interference or threatened physical interference of the plaintiff whilst she was detained at the Long Bay Prison Hospital. 
     
      
    102 The State relied upon written submissions (paragraphs [49] to [61]) of the Outline of Submissions for the Defendant dated 9 February 2010. 
     
      
    103 Mr Craddock and Ms Becket submitted for the State that the plaintiff’s claim of assault and/or battery failed “at the first hurdle”. It was contended that the agreed facts do not establish that there was an assault or a battery. 
     
      
    104 It was acknowledged that assault connotes a reasonable apprehension of an imminent physical interference and battery is an intentional touching or physical interference with another person. 
     
      
    105 It was further contended that references in the clinical notes such as “transfer”, “detain”, “return”, “take and discharge” do not admit of a reasonable apprehension of physical interference or actual touching or physical interference. It was contended that there was no evidence in support of the plaintiff’s assertion that “she reasonably apprehended imminent physical interference to compel her to return to her cell if she was non-compliant”. It was further submitted there was no evidence of physical contact. 
     
      
    106 It was contended that the plaintiff’s reliance on a nurse’s note to the effect that the plaintiff was increasingly distressed at having to return to her cell was not evidence of an apprehension of any physical interference or, for that matter, action in the nature of compulsion. It was contended that the word “escort” is a benign term which did not necessarily attract physical interference. 
     
      
    107 In the alternative, it was contended that if the Court accepted that there was evidence of physical contact, then the State submitted that the actions of its officers, servants and agents were lawful and reasonable. The actions of detaining, transferring, returning and escorting the plaintiff were undertaken in the performance of each person’s duty to implement an order of a limiting term imposed by the District Court. 
     
      
    108 Reliance was again placed upon the decision in Hague (supra). In this respect, it was contended that it would appear anomalous to deny a plaintiff’s claim for wrongful imprisonment because the prisoner has no residual liberty but then to allow a claim in assault or battery for the actions that necessarily arise from the lawful constraint on her liberty (written submissions, paragraph [54]). 
     
      
    109 In this respect, the actions of Corrective Services Officers in moving a prisoner from a correctional centre to another such centre or around a prison arose naturally from the order of the Court to “imprison the plaintiff”: paragraph [54]. 
     
      
    110 Finally, it was contended that it was apparent that a Corrective Services Officer may use no more force than was reasonably necessary “in dealing with an inmate”: clause 121(1) and clause 119, Crimes (Administration of Sentences) Regulation 2001. 
     
      
    111 Finally the State took issue with the plaintiff’s alternative cause of action in trespass to the person. 
     
      
    112 It was contended, inter alia, that, following the reasoning in Cobbett v Grey (1849) 4 Ex 729 (supra), the detention which necessarily follows the limiting term that was imposed by the District Court in this case provided a similar authority which had removed the plaintiff’s liberty, adopting comments made in Hague (supra), that if there was a remedy for the apparent wrong inflicted upon the plaintiff then lay elsewhere in the law of wrongful imprisonment: Written Submission, paragraph [61]. 
     
      
    113 Finally, Mr Craddock on behalf of the State contended that there ought to be a verdict for the defendant with costs. 
     
      
    114 I consider there is considerable force in Mr Craddock’s submission that, although the nursing notes refer to matters such as the plaintiff expressing or manifesting a distressed state from time to time during her detention, the question remains as to whether the particular factual matters relied upon by the plaintiff rise to the level of establishing circumstances that constitute an implied use of force against her during and by virtue of her confinement or detention. 
     
      
    115 A similar question arose in Watson (supra). It was noted in that case that, although there was a dispute as to whether the officer told the plaintiff that he was arresting him, it was plain and it was made clear to him that he had to go to the hospital. The plaintiff protested but went to a police car nearby and went in it to the hospital with the defendant. Walsh J noted at 626 that no physical force had been used at any time by the defendant “… But I find that in the circumstances the plaintiff had a justified apprehension that, if he did not submit to do what was asked of him, he would be compelled by force to go to the hospital. Therefore, a restraint was imposed upon the plaintiff which amounted to an ‘imprisonment’ of him by the defendant …”. 
     
      
    116 I do not consider that the evidence establishes an assault, whether in terms of an apprehension in the plaintiff or an assault in the sense of the application of a physical force to the plaintiff. 
     
      
    117 I have earlier referred to extracts from the hospital notes to which my attention was drawn by Mr Game in the course of his submissions. Whilst there are references throughout the notes to the plaintiff’s distress and unhappiness at being confined to D Ward, there is also reference to the fact that she was “resigned to same”, although at times being recorded as feeling or exhibiting distress. 
     
      
    118 There is no evidence of the application of force or of threats being made to the plaintiff. Rather than there being evidence of protest by the plaintiff, the evidence indicates that the plaintiff acted with a sense of resignation to her placement in cell 16 in D Ward. 
     
      
    119 I, accordingly, do not consider that the evidence establishes either actual physical interference or an express or implied threat of an assault. 
     
      
    120 In relation to the plaintiff’s cause of action in trespass to the person, as I have earlier noted, the plaintiff relied upon that tortious cause of action as an alternative only to the claim in false imprisonment. In those circumstances, I do not consider that the need arises to express a concluded view in relation to the claim in trespass. 
     
      
    121 I will, however, permit the parties, should they wish, to make any further submissions in that respect in light of these reasons for judgment and the fact that I have determined liability in the plaintiff’s favour on her claim of false imprisonment. 
     
      
    122 The order made, by consent, on 26 February 2009 was for the determination of “questions of liability” separately from and prior to the questions of damages. 
     
      
    123 On the findings and conclusions set out above, I propose to determine the issue of liability on the plaintiff’s pleaded cause of action of wrongful imprisonment in her favour against the State. 
     
      
    124 I request the parties to draft short minutes of order. Costs of the proceedings are reserved. 
     
      
    125 I propose to additionally grant leave to the parties to apply, by arrangement with my associate, for the proceedings to be re-listed for mention and, as appropriate, case management directions in relation to any hearing on damages and the residual matter to which I have referred arising from the plaintiff’s alternative cause of action. 
     
      
    126 The issue of liability on the plaintiff’s pleaded cause of action in false imprisonment is determined in favour of the plaintiff against the defendant (the State of NSW).

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HER HONOUR: On 3 February 2010 the Crown presented an indictment charging the offenders, Luke Joseph Cambey and Todd William Carney, with the murder of Derrick Reid. The offenders pleaded not guilty and the matter proceeded to trial.  
     
      
    2 The evidence led at trial established that the deceased died on the evening of 29 January 2006 from head injuries he sustained as a result of being repeatedly struck with a metal bar, approximately 30cm in length, that had at one time formed part of a socket set. The sole issue at trial was whether the offenders were two of the three men who entered the deceased’s home unit at Cartwright in the early hours of that morning and fatally assaulted him.  
     
      
    3 There were no eyewitnesses to the murder and no evidence from the deceased’s neighbours, or the deceased, capable of identifying either of the offenders as the assailants. There was no forensic evidence of any kind associating either of the offenders with the deceased’s unit or the assault which resulted in his death. The Crown case depended upon the jury accepting the evidence of a number of the offenders’ friends, each of whom, in slightly different ways, gave evidence that Carney admitted to assaulting the deceased with the metal bar and that Cambey admitted that he was present when this occurred and that he participated in the assault by kicking the deceased. The evidence of each of these witnesses was challenged as being both unreliable and untrue. The offenders did not give evidence. On 18 February 2010 the jury convicted both offenders of murder. 4 The maximum penalty for murder is life imprisonment. It attracts a standard non-parole period of 20 years. Consistent with the approach mandated by s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (“the Sentencing Act”) a sentence of life imprisonment is reserved for offending in the category of a worst case. The Crown does not submit that a sentence of life imprisonment is warranted in this case. That is a concession properly made.  
     
      
    5 The Crown did submit however that Carney should be sentenced to a term of imprisonment against which the standard non-parole period of 20 years should be imposed, his offending being within the mid range of objective seriousness and there being nothing of sufficient weight in his subjective circumstances, or otherwise comprehended in s 21A of the Sentencing Act, to justify a departure from the prescribed period of 20 years during which he should be ineligible for release to parole. The Crown submitted that there was a legitimate basis for differentiating the objective seriousness constituted by Cambey’s offending such as to justify a reduction in the standard non-parole period in his case, albeit by a modest degree. 6 The offenders did not give evidence on sentence. From the evidence led at trial I am satisfied that the following facts are established for sentencing purposes.7 The deceased resided in a home unit in Cartwright. He supplied cannabis from those premises to users of the drug and had done so for a period of years prior to his death. A quantity of cannabis was found in his refrigerator by investigating police.  
     
      
    8 On the evening of 28 January 2006, and into the early morning of 29 January 2006, the deceased was at his home unit alone. Other residents or guests of residents, were in and around the unit block at this time.  
     
      
    9 At around 5am on 29 January 2006, the offenders (in company with a third man) travelled to the deceased’s unit from Jacob Epenian’s house in Lurnea in a car driven by a fourth man, Joel Grant, for the purpose of obtaining some cannabis from the deceased on credit. All four men had been drinking and using drugs (including cannabis) at a party at Epenian’s house for some hours before leaving and driving to the deceased’s home unit. Sean Berriman, and Carney’s girlfriend, Jessica Laing, were also at the party. Grant, Epenian, Berriman and Laing were the Crown witnesses upon whose evidence the Crown relied at trial. 
     
      
    10 Neither of the offenders (or the third man) had met the deceased prior to going to his unit on 29 January 2006. Grant, on the other hand, had purchased cannabis from the deceased on previous occasions. He was introduced by Jason Blackhall, a friend of the deceased, it being the deceased’s habit not to supply cannabis to people he either did not know directly or perhaps indirectly through someone he knew well enough to trust.  
     
      
    11 I am satisfied that the offenders (and Grant) planned to, and ultimately succeeded in, gaining entry to the deceased’s unit using Mr Blackhall’s name. I am also satisfied that it was agreed between them that Grant would remain in the car with a view to achieving their common objective that once they were inside the unit they would persuade the deceased to either give them cannabis on credit without force, or under the threat of force if he refused, and that they were conscious that were Grant with them, and if force did have to be used, they would be at risk of being identified. I am also satisfied that Cambey assumed the role of the person who would knock on the deceased’s door and that the other two men would stand back from the door until the deceased opened it. While this has all the hallmarks of a strategy to force entry to the deceased’s unit in order to launch a premeditated attack on him to steal his cannabis, I am unable to be satisfied of that fact to the criminal standard.  
     
      
    12 Grant gave evidence that none of the three men were armed when they left the car to go to the deceased’s unit. Even assuming that to be the case (about which I have some doubt) I am satisfied that Carney armed himself with the metal bar before entering the unit, and that the third man revealed that he had a taser gun at that time, at the very latest. I am also satisfied that they armed themselves to advance their common purpose to obtain cannabis without having to pay for it. I am not satisfied however that there was an agreement that violence would in fact be inflicted, as distinct from that being a possibility in the likely event that the deceased refused to supply the cannabis without payment. Accordingly, for sentencing purposes, I am satisfied that before Cambey entered the unit (even if moments before) he knew that both Carney and the third man were armed even though he was not himself armed. The extent to which that operates to reduce the objective criminality of his offending is a matter I will return to consider. 13 Within a short but indeterminate time after the deceased allowed the offenders into his unit he was viciously assaulted. I am satisfied that Carney inflicted the head wounds by repeatedly striking the deceased’s head with the metal bar and that Cambey joined in the assault by kicking the deceased. I am satisfied that the only reason the deceased was assaulted was because he refused to supply cannabis to the three men on credit and that the extent of violence they inflicted on him was because he did not submit to the attack but sought to defend himself against it. 
     
      
    14 The autopsy revealed the deceased’s head injuries were the direct cause of his death. Four wounds to the head were identified. One was a substantial bruise located on the back of the head as a result of blunt trauma, a kick, punch or stomp to the head being recognised as possible causes. I am satisfied that this wound was inflicted by Cambey when he kicked the deceased to the head after Carney had hit him with sufficient force to the head with the metal bar to cause him to fall to the ground. I am also satisfied that he kicked the deceased as he was endeavouring to get back to his feet.  
     
      
    15 The other three wounds were lacerations. The first to the left temple was 5cm in length. Its shape was consistent with the curved end of the metal bar that was retrieved from the scene. A second laceration to the right side of the back of the head intersected with a third laceration of 11cm in length to the left hand side of the head. The evidence established that this compound laceration was the result of two independent applications of a significant amount of localised force. Immediately beneath this laceration was a depressed fracture of the deceased’s skull. I am satisfied that all three lacerations were inflicted when Carney struck the deceased repeatedly with the metal bar. In addition, I am satisfied that the force of the assault by both offenders was severe enough to cause blood to spatter on the walls of the unit and for blood to pool on the deceased’s bedclothes. Although the compound laceration was capable of being regarded as the most significant of the four individual wounds, if for no other reason than because of the associated depressed fracture and the swelling and bleeding in the brain resulting from it, the cause of death was reported as a combination of the four wounds given their concentration on the deceased’s head. 
     
      
    16 There can be no doubt that the offenders knew that the deceased was severely wounded when they left the unit. Although there is no evidence to support a finding that they took any of the deceased’s cannabis, the fact that bagged cannabis was located in various places in the deceased’s unit does not compel a finding that none was taken. Suffice for sentencing purposes that I am satisfied that obtaining cannabis without payment was what ultimately motivated the offenders to brutally and fatally assault the deceased. 
     
      
    17 Carney either dropped or threw the metal bar as he made his way back to Grant’s car. It was ultimately seized by police. The forensic evidence revealed that DNA and human hairs recovered from the metal bar matched the DNA profile of the deceased. The taser was never recovered.  
     
      
    18 Grant gave evidence that when the three men arrived back at the car, one of the offenders (who was not identified) said they had bashed the deceased, and that they kept bashing him, but that they could not knock him to the ground. 19 After the offenders fled from the unit the deceased managed to wrap his head in a towel to stem the blood flow and to make his way to a neighbouring unit to seek help. Shortly thereafter, police and ambulance personnel attended the scene. The deceased told police: 
     
      
       
        
        “They got me with a baton and taser …They said they were friends of Jason’s … I let them in”. 
        
       
      
    20 The deceased was conveyed from the unit by ambulance and triaged at Liverpool hospital where he underwent surgery to treat the injuries to his head. He also sustained fractures to his fingers and bruising to his trunk, arms and hands. Despite surgical intervention to suture the head wounds, the deceased’s intracranial pressure continued to rise. He died later that day. 
     
      
    21 When the offenders and Grant arrived back at Epenian’s house shortly after dawn he described them as not looking themselves. Nothing was said immediately by any of them however before long Carney said that the plan to obtain drugs on credit had, in his words, “not gone according to plan” and that the deceased was what he described as “not in a good way"" when they left him. Epenian also gave evidence that the offenders then started bragging about what they had done. He gave evidence that Carney said: 
     
      
       
        
        “…we got there and knocked on the door, the guy next door came out and shit himself and then went back inside. Derrick asked who was it and came to the door and Carney (sic) said it's Jase's mate. Derrick opened the door and they casually walked in the flat. As they walked in one of them dropped the Taser and Derrick turned around and said ‘this is not happening to me, not now, not ever”. 
        
       
      
    22 Carney then said that: 
     
      
       
        
        “(he) cracked (the deceased) with a pole and he fell on the bed. He couldn't believe that he got back up so then Cambey started kicking into him. (He) said that he was cracking him with the pole in the head and he was bleeding and there was blood everywhere. (He) said that (the deceased) kept getting up and that's why they left”.  
        
       
      
    23 Laing was asleep when the offenders decided to go to the deceased’s unit to get the cannabis and was asleep upon their return. However, later that day, she had a conversation with Carney in the course of which he said they had bashed someone and that it had gone too far. He said that the guy kept getting back up. He said that he had a pole and that after leaving the flat he ran and threw it away. Laing also gave evidence of another conversation, about a week later, at Epenian’s house, where everyone who had attended Epenian’s party the previous week, including the offenders, were talking about what had happened to the deceased since the news of his death was by that time public knowledge. A collective decision was made not to discuss the matter again. Consistent with that agreement none of the offenders’ friends informed police of what they knew of the circumstances surrounding the death of the deceased and the involvement of the offenders. 
     
      
    24 An extensive police investigation into the deceased’s murder via community and other sources failed to identify the offenders as either suspects or people of interest. On 2 November 2007, over 18 months after the murder, a reward was posted by police for information that may lead to the arrest and charge of those responsible. Over the course of a period of months from that date Sean Berriman provided information to the police. This information led to Epenian, Grant and Laing being spoken to by police. In the result, each of the four people gave statements directly implicating the offenders in the murder by their own admission.  
     
      
    25 Carney was arrested and charged with the deceased’s murder on 24 July 2008. At the time of arrest he was in custody having been convicted on 27 November 2007 in the District Court at Campbelltown of discharging a loaded firearm to resist arrest and driving a vehicle recklessly. He was sentenced to 6 years imprisonment, with a non-parole period of 3 years and 6 months, commencing on 26 December 2006 and expiring on 25 June 2010. He is currently serving the balance of that non-parole period. In circumstances where none of his remand has been spent referable to the offence for which he stands to be sentenced in these proceedings, his sentence will take effect from the expiration of the existing non-parole period. The commencement date of his sentence will be fixed accordingly. 
     
      
    26 Cambey was arrested and charged with the deceased’s murder on 17 July 2008 and remanded in custody. On 20 November 2008 he was sentenced to a fixed term of 2 months imprisonment for the offence of larceny, commencing from 17 July 2008 and expiring on 16 September 2008. He is entitled to have taken into account a period of 1 year 7 months and 14 days as being solely referable to the murder charge. The commencement date of his sentence will be adjusted accordingly. 
     
      
       
      The victim impact statement  
      
    27 The Crown tendered four victim impact statements from the deceased’s father, sister and two brothers. They speak of the traumatic experience in having to identify the deceased while he was on life support at the Liverpool hospital, the devastating loss the family has suffered as a result of his death, and the empty void that remains. They describe him as having a great sense of humour, and having many lifelong friends, over two hundred of whom attended his funeral. The deceased’s younger brother conveyed how the absence of the deceased was felt at the birth of his first son and how his absence will be felt in the future at family birthdays and family gatherings. I extend my sympathy to the family of the deceased for their loss. 
     
      
    28 In the final paragraph of one of his elder brother’s statement he appealed to me to deliver justice for his brother. It is important that I make clear that this sentencing exercise is not directed to that end. This sentencing exercise is primarily directed to imposing a sentence of imprisonment on these offenders that will, in my assessment, meet what the community can and should expect of a system of justice that is as responsive to the community it serves as it must be to the established principles of law that have developed to give consistency to its expression. It may not be easy for the family of the deceased to accept that a life taken will not be paid for with a life in prison, but that is not the law.  
     
      
    29 The standard non-parole period of 20 years for the offence of murder represents the period an offender is obliged to spend in custody before being entitled to be considered for release to parole. As s 54(2) of the Sentencing Act makes clear, the standard non-parole period is intended to apply to an offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness after trial unless I am satisfied that there are reasons, within the matters comprehended under s 21A of the Sentencing Act, for setting a non-parole period that is greater or lesser than that statutorily prescribed period (see MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271; 164 A Crim R 93 at [30]).  
     
      
    30 Carney tendered two psychiatric reports from Dr Olav Nielssen dated respectively 4 September 2007 and 11 March 2010. The earlier report was prepared for the purpose of the sentence proceedings in Campbelltown District Court to which I have earlier referred. Those offences were committed on 27 December 2006, just short of twelve months after the murder of the deceased but before he was arrested and charged with the deceased’s murder. The second report was prepared for the current proceedings. 
     
      
    31 Despite a diagnosis of schizophrenia (which in the report of March 2010 was considered to be in remission) and a substance abuse disorder in remission at the time of the first report, Mr Winch, who also appeared on the offender’s behalf at trial, did not rely upon either of the reports as mitigating the objective seriousness of the offender’s role in the murder of the deceased, in the sense that he did not submit that any underlying mental illness might explain or put into context Carney’s unprovoked and violent attack on the deceased, or his attitude in the face of being arrested, charged and ultimately convicted of his murder. He could hardly have submitted otherwise in circumstances where Carney has maintained the position that he did not go to the deceased’s home unit on the morning of 26 January 2006 much less that he was the man who fatally attacked him with the metal bar. 
     
      
    32 Dr Nielssen’s reports were relied upon solely on the question whether, with the offender’s schizophrenia and substance abuse disorder now in remission as a result of his compliance with prescribed medication and his withdrawal from drugs, his age at the time of the offending, together with his prospects of rehabilitation, are such that a departure from the imposition of a standard non-parole period might be justified in accordance with the principled approach authoritatively stated in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168. Mr Winch also submitted that notwithstanding the fact that Carney armed himself with the metal bar before entering the deceased’s unit I would be satisfied that the attack was not premeditated. That fact, together with the Crown’s concession that Carney did not inflict the head wounds with the intention of killing the deceased, so it was submitted, supports a finding that the offending falls short of offending in the middle of the range of objective seriousness and for that reason alone the imposition of the standard non-parole period of 20 years was not mandated. 33 Cambey tendered a report by Dr John Jacmon prepared on 21 March 2010 where he reported his findings after performing a range of psychological tests. It is not necessary to extract the results of the testing since it is not submitted that any of the results operate to mitigate the objective seriousness of Cambey’s offending. As with the tender of Dr Neilssen’s reports in Carney's case, Dr Jacmon’s report is only relied upon as reflecting favourably upon Cambey’s prospects of rehabilitation, a matter I am urged to take into account in mitigation under s 21A(3)(h) of the Sentencing Act, and serving, in his case, to justify a significant departure from the imposition of the standard non-parole period.  
     
      
    34 Cambey’s initial presentation to Dr Jacmon indicated the possibility of him suffering cognitive deficiencies. In order to test that hypothesis, Cambey completed the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence. Both his verbal intelligence and performance intelligence were assessed at the borderline level, between low average and very low. The tests and the background information supplied by Cambey also indicated significant levels of Attention Hyperactivity Disorder and depression.  
     
      
    35 With that proviso, I note that unlike Carney, Cambey did indicate to Dr Jacmon some acceptance of responsibility for the deceased’s death, albeit in very guarded terms, by saying that he was sorry that the incident occurred and the distress that it has caused to loved ones, which I take to mean the family of the deceased. 
     
      
       
      Is the objective seriousness of the offending in the mid range? 
       
      
    36 In R v Way the Court held that the assessment of objective seriousness is to be made by reference to the circumstances in which the offence was committed and not the circumstances of the offender, other than those causally connected to the commission of the offence. As counsel for both of the offenders made clear in their respective submissions there is nothing in the reports of Drs Nielssen or Jacmon that is relied upon, or could be relied upon, to establish in any relevant causal sense the state of mind or motivation of either of the offenders when they fatally assaulted the deceased. In addition, there is nothing elsewhere in the evidence to which counsel referred that serves to establish anything personal to either offender that explains or even elucidates the motivation behind the vicious and unprovoked attack in which they jointly engaged, other than frustration at being refused drugs on credit. Despite the evidence of the people they were with on the night before and the morning of the assault that drugs and alcohol were being consumed and in significant quantities at the party at Epenian’s house, I am not prepared to place any weight on the fact that the offenders, or either of them, might have been affected by drugs or alcohol at the time of the assault when neither have claimed that they were so affected. 37 On the offender Carney’s behalf it was submitted that an intention to kill is a consideration tending to greater objective seriousness than an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm and that however deliberate and sustained was his assault with the metal bar, wielded as it was at the head of the deceased at least four times in rapid succession, the accompanying intention fell short of an intention to kill the deceased and that the Crown’s concession in that regard was properly made. Bearing in mind that an intention to kill must be a finding I can confidently make beyond reasonable doubt I am unable to be satisfied that Carney’s intention is of that kind despite its very considerable brutality. That does not however necessarily detract from a finding that his offending is within a mid range of objective gravity. Mr Winch submitted what serves to support a finding of that kind is that I could not be satisfied that the killing was premeditated. The case of R v Nguyen [2007] NSWCCA 363; 180 A Crim R 267 was cited in support of that proposition. In that case Smart AJ was satisfied that the primary sentencing judge had erred in holding that the murder for which the appellant was sentenced was substantially above the mid range in objective seriousness. The deceased was killed when four men entered a billiard hall in Cabramatta armed with pistols and a samurai sword. The first man pointed at or in the direction of one of the patrons and then fired the pistol at close range. Another of the patrons was shot fatally in the chest and another wounded in the upper body. The primary judge was satisfied that the actions of the gunman left no room for doubt that his intention was to kill and that his actions were premeditated, irrespective of who was the intended victim. Although Smart AJ was of the view that an intention to kill and premeditation are usual elements in a murder of mid range objective seriousness, and that there was nothing in the surrounding circumstances of that case that placed the offending above the mid range despite the grave nature of the killing, I do not understand his Honour to have intended to specify an intention to kill and premeditation as requisite elements of mid range offending generally.38 Although I have afforded both of the offenders the benefit of the doubt in so far as it might have been found against them that they planned a forced entry to the deceased’s home with the intention of robbing him with violence, I am nonetheless satisfied that Carney’s deliberate arming of himself and his use of the metal bar as a weapon, the degree of violence he was personally responsible for inflicting on a man caught by surprise and defenceless in his own home, coupled with the fact that he not only took no measures to assist him after the assault but actively boasted of having bashed him to the point of submission, places his offending as within the mid range of objective seriousness. I am conscious in so finding that I am required to hypothesise as to what an abstract offence in the middle of the range of objective seriousness for an offence of this kind would be. Although I am satisfied that the probabilities favour a finding that the offender’s decision to strike the deceased was in a sense impulsive I remain satisfied that this offence falls within the mid range. His conduct and behaviour thereafter confirms my view that having formed the intention to inflict serious violence on the deceased he did so with a calculated and chilling detachment and not as a result of loss of self-control.  
     
      
    39 I am satisfied that the Crown’s concession that Cambey’s offending falls just short of mid range offending is properly made principally because he was not armed and, while he must be taken to have been aware that the other two men were armed, I accept that this was not as a result of any pre-planning or agreement as distinct from something he became aware of within a very short time of approaching the deceased’s unit and seeking entry. While he joined in the assault thereafter by kicking the deceased while he was on the ground, the wound he inflicted was not fatal. I am satisfied that his liability for murder is as a result of the active assistance and encouragement he gave to Carney as the principal offender - a finding that is borne out by the jury’s verdict. That said the standard non-parole period remains a reference point in the imposition of the non-parole period that will be imposed in his case.  
     
      
    40 Having considered the question of objective seriousness the question then presents as to whether I am satisfied that there is anything personal to the offender Carney, or otherwise able to be relied upon in mitigation, that would justify a departure from the imposition of the standard non-parole period in his case and whether there are matters in mitigation that inform the non-parole period to be imposed on Cambey.  
     
      
      The subjective cases  
      
    41 Carney was aged 19 at the time of the murder and 23 at the date of sentence. In his various interviews with Dr Nielssen he described a happy upbringing free from any form of neglect or trauma. He attended Westfield Sports High School until Year 12. Despite completing the Higher School Certificate in 2005 he did not complete enough subjects to facilitate his entrance to tertiary education. Soon after leaving high school he secured an apprenticeship as a plumber, however he discontinued his apprenticeship after a month. At high school he was considered to be a promising rugby league player. He was however unable to continue playing rugby league at a more competitive level after high school as a consequence of suffering several injuries, including a serious injury to his right knee. His drug use also escalated in his last year at high school. He admitted to having used MDMA, cocaine, and methamphetamine, first at weekend parties and then progressing to more regular use, sometimes during the week.  
     
      
    42 He reported a family history of schizophrenia (a history his mother confirms) but told Dr Nielssen that he had not had any contact with developmental paediatricians or counselling, and that his only treatment with psychotropic medication was a single dose of diazepam during his overnight admission to Liverpool Hospital six months before his arrest. Soon after his entry into custody in November 2007 he was transferred as an involuntary patient to the acute psychiatric ward of Long Bay Prison Hospital where he was treated with antipsychotic medication for several months as a result of which his symptoms progressively abated. He has been maintained on antipsychotic medication following his discharge. At the time of his first interview with Dr Nielssen he was taking Zyprexa at the standard dosage of 15 mg per day. Dr Nielssen assessed his attention and concentration at this time to be within normal limits and that his registration and retrieval of information was also thought to be largely unimpaired. His premorbid intelligence was estimated to be within the normal range. At the second interview three years later, on 9 March 2010, Dr Nielssen reported that the pharmacological regime had been effective in controlling any symptoms of schizophrenia. Thus the diagnosis of schizophrenia (in remission). 43 Mr Winch accepted that an assessment of Mr Carney’s prospects of rehabilitation are problematic given that he steadfastly refuses to accept any responsibility for the death of the deceased. However, where there is evidence that he had an emerging psychiatric condition at the time of the offending, a condition which is now effectively controlled, I accept Dr Nielssen’s view that there is a low risk of him committing further offences and that his prospects of rehabilitation are sound. I also consider that his prospects are promoted by the fact that he has a strong and supportive family network as evidenced by his family attending throughout the trial and on sentence. I am moved by the letter from his mother and her unwavering love for her son. That said, for reasons that are both bewildering and tragic, this young man has jettisoned a potentially productive working and social life by the senseless killing of another person. He must pay the penalty for that conduct by serving a significant period in custody. I am, however, satisfied that his youth should be afforded weight in fixing the period he must serve before being eligible for release into the community and that the imposition of the standard non-parole period in his case is not warranted for that reason. I am not persuaded that there should be any further adjustment to the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term.44 In the clinical interview conducted by Dr Jacmon Cambey related that he was raised in Liverpool and enjoyed a close and supportive family upbringing. He attended Ashcroft Public School and then Ashcroft High. He was suspended several times before being expelled in Year 9. His family then moved to Perth where he then took up employment as a bricklayer’s labourer before his family moved back to Sydney. In Sydney he continued casual work in the building industry. During this time he reported using marijuana and alcohol daily and ecstasy on weekends. He became a frequent gambler, attending racecourses and casinos. At the time of the offence his drug abuse was assessed at clinically significant levels.  
     
      
    45 Cambey’s prospects of rehabilitation are also problematic, not the least because I know little of the degree of support he can expect from friends or family on his release. That said, in his case, I have the added confidence that over time he will gain added insight into his offending given that he has, however belatedly, accepted responsibility for his actions. Dr Jacmon proposed a treatment program which, save for the desirability of him undertaking educational courses to improve cognitive functioning and enhance his verbal and numeric skills, is unlikely to be available within the custodial setting. I strongly recommend that he be afforded educational facilities and opportunities appropriate to his needs to enhance his prospects of gainful employment and assimilation on his eventual release. As with his co-offender, Cambey must also spend a significant period in custody. Despite there being factors in his case that might amount to special circumstances, having already accounted for his relative youth and his good prospects of rehabilitation in fixing the non-parole period I do not propose to further adjust the statutory ratio between the non-parole period and the balance of term. 
     
      
    46 Mr Carney you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 16 years and 6 months to date from 25 June 2010 and to expire on 24 December 2026. There is to be a balance of term of 5 years and 6 months to expire on 24 June 2032. 
     
      
    47 Mr Cambey you are sentenced to a non-parole period of 14 years and 6 months to date from 16 September 2008 and to expire on 15 March 2023 There is to be a balance of term of 3 years and 6 months to expire on 15 September 2026.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The accused is the subject of a special hearing, having been found unfit to be tried and the Mental Health Review Tribunal having found that he would not become fit to be tried in the ensuing twelve months. He has been arraigned upon an indictment alleging that he had murdered Ms Linda Tregerthan at Byron Bay on 30 August 2004. He is taken to have pleaded not guilty. All of the foregoing have been pursuant to provisions of the Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act 1990.2 Mr Bruce SC who is appearing for the accused has made what is referred to as a ""Prasad application"". He has asked that I direct myself that I can bring in a verdict of not guilty at any stage after the end of the Crown case. We have now reached that stage. 3 This is a reference to R v Prasad (1979) 23 SASR 161 which stands for the proposition that an accused person can ask the trial judge to direct the jury that they are entitled to acquit the accused at any time after the close of the Crown case without hearing the defence case, addresses or the summing-up. It has been said that the power of a trial judge to do so should be exercised sparingly and only where the evidence lacks cogency: R v Pahuja (1987) 49 SASR 191.4 I am presiding over this special hearing without a jury: s 21A Mental Health (Forensic Provisions) Act. Taken literally, the submission is to the effect that I should direct myself that I may acquit the accused at any time after the close of the Crown case. There is no need for me to direct myself in that fashion because I already know that I can do so in my role as the tribunal of fact. Rather, I take the submission to be to the effect that I should in fact return a verdict of not guilty at this stage. That requires brief consideration of the cogency of the evidence upon which the Crown relies. 5 Ms Tregerthan's deceased body was found in the sunroom of her house in Byron Bay in the early afternoon of 30 August 2004. She died from the effects of multiple stab wounds to the neck and torso. The Crown case alleging that the perpetrator of her murder was the accused is entirely circumstantial.6 Submissions were made by Mr Bruce concerning the evidence of Ms Cynthia Scopel and Mr Peter Hardwick. It was pointed out that they were giving evidence of conversations with the accused that occurred many years ago, in fact almost six years ago. Mr Bruce submitted that the evidence amounted to interpretations by the witnesses of what they believed was said rather than what was in fact said. Consequently, it was submitted, their evidence should be regarded as unreliable. 7 If accepted, Ms Scopel's evidence tended to suggest some antipathy or resentment by the accused towards Ms Tregerthan. Her evidence was to the effect that about two weeks before the murder the accused approached her and said, ""I know, I know, I know what you do"". She said that he may have said, ""I know what you do with your eyes"". Ms Scopel implied that this was said in an intimidating fashion. 8 If accepted, Mr Hardwick's evidence tended to suggest that the accused had, in a month or two after Ms Tregerthan's death, harboured thoughts suggesting that he was not averse to causing the death of another person. He claimed that the accused had said to him, ""It's no big deal to kill somebody"". He also claimed that there was a statement made by the accused to the effect that he knew somebody who had died, been killed, or had been murdered. This evidence is relied upon by the Crown as suggesting involvement, or tending to confirm involvement, in the recent death of Ms Tregerthan. 9 Even if the evidence of the conversations were to be accepted, they do not alone establish that the accused was the person responsible for the death of Ms Tregerthan. They are, in the context of the Crown case overall, relatively minor pieces of circumstantial evidence suggesting that the accused might have been the person responsible. There are serious questions about the accuracy of the evidence given by both of the witnesses given the time that has elapsed.10 Reference was also made to records of the accused's bank account that were tendered by the Crown. The submission was made that they simply established the presence in Byron Bay of the accused on the day of the murder. They, of course, place him at an ATM machine, not at the deceased's home. 11 The major component of the Crown case is the DNA evidence. DNA was recovered from fingernails from the deceased's left and right hand and from a blood-stained pillow case found in the vicinity of her body. 12 In one fingernail from the left hand there was found to be DNA from two contributors. The DNA of the major contributor was consistent with being the deceased's and the DNA of the minor contributor was consistent with being the accused's. The DNA profile of the minor contributor was expected to be found in 1 in 100 million individuals in the general population. 13 In respect of a fingernail from the right hand there was DNA recovered which was also from two contributors. The DNA of the major contributor was consistent with being the deceased's and the DNA of the minor contributor consistent with being the accused's. The DNA profile of the minor contributor was expected to be found in 1 in 86,000 individuals of the general population. 14 A stain on one area of a pillow case was also the source of DNA from two contributors, the major contributor's DNA profile being consistent with that of the deceased and the profile of the minor contributor consistent with that of the accused. The DNA profile of the minor contributor was expected to be found in 1 in 1.7 billion individuals in the general population.15 Mr Bruce submitted, in effect, that the problem with this evidence is that even if it is accepted that the accused was the source of the DNA found in each of the minor contributions, there is no evidence as to when some bodily tissue or fluid of his came to be on the fingernails of the deceased and on the pillow case. There was evidence from the forensic biologist, Ms Sharon Neville, to the effect that it was not necessarily the case that such DNA would have come to be on those surfaces at the same time as the deceased's DNA. 16 The problem with that submission is that the evidence, at face value at least, is reasonably compelling and there is nothing, so far at least, to explain how DNA with a fairly distinctive profile consistent with being the accused's came to be on those surfaces.17 In my view it cannot be said that the Crown case so lacks cogency that I should return a verdict of not guilty at this stage. This should not be taken to indicate that I have formed any particular view at this stage as to what the appropriate verdict should be. There is a good deal of evidence and, I anticipate, potential arguments going in either direction as to how I should evaluate it and what I should conclude from it. I will be assisted, at least, by hearing closing submissions from counsel in this respect.18 I decline the invitation to return a verdict of acquittal at this stage.

      JUDGMENT 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR: The plaintiff, Peter Charles Spratt, is charged with two counts of sexual intercourse without consent and two counts of indecent assault. The offences are alleged to have been committed upon a young woman during the evening of 7 March 2008 and the early hours of the following morning. He awaits committal proceedings in the Local Court prosecuted by the first defendant, the Director of Public Prosecutions.  
     
      
    2 He sought an order, pursuant to s 91 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, that the complainant and three other prosecution witnesses attend the committal proceedings to give oral evidence. The second defendant, Magistrate Huber, declined to direct the attendance of the complainant. She directed the attendance of the three witnesses, but for the purpose only of cross-examination on certain specified topics. The magistrate has entered the usual submitting appearance. 
     
      
    3 The plaintiff seeks leave to appeal against her Honour’s decision in relation to the complainant and the witnesses, pursuant to s 53(3)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. That paragraph provides for an appeal to this Court by leave, on a ground involving a question of law alone, against “an order” made by a magistrate in any committal proceedings. In Nanevski v Haskett & Anor [2006] NSWSC 1114 at [25], McClellan CJ at CL expressed the view that the refusal of a magistrate to direct a witness to attend committal proceedings for cross-examination would not qualify as an “order” for the purpose of that provision. Presumably, his Honour’s reasoning would also apply to a direction that a witness attend to give oral evidence when it is sought to challenge the limitation placed upon the matters which might be the subject of cross-examination. In the present case I do not find it necessary to arrive at a concluded view about this issue. 
     
      
    4 Alternatively, the plaintiff seeks certain declarations and relief by way of certiorari and mandamus under s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970. The reluctance of this Court to grant declaratory relief in relation to committal proceedings, and the necessity to demonstrate the actual or constructive failure of a magistrate to exercise his or her jurisdiction to secure relief in the nature of mandamus, are the subject of abundant authority, conveniently summarised by Johnson J in Director of Public Prosecutions v O’Conner [2006] NSWSC 458, 181 A Crim R 294, at [37] – [40]. In Nanevski v Haskett at [28], the Chief Judge also expressed the opinion that the Court should be reluctant to use its prerogative powers to intervene when “the legislature has provided a statutory but limited right of appeal in relation to committal proceedings,” although he did not question the availability of those powers in appropriate cases. 
     
      
    5 There is no need to set out the details of the complainant’s account of the offences alleged. The two counts of indecent assault are allegations of indecent touching, and the counts of sexual intercourse without consent allege digital and penile penetration. The complainant was 18 years old at the time. She and the plaintiff were fellow employees at a retail store, and they had had some social contact. On the occasion in question the plaintiff, the complainant, her step-sister and two other young women went out to celebrate the step-sister’s birthday. Put shortly, the celebration began in the early evening of Friday, 7 March 2008 at a hotel at Artarmon, then it moved to a bar at Kings Cross, and by the early hours of the following morning they had repaired to a hotel at Crows Nest.  
     
      
    6 The complainant made three statements to the police, the first of them containing the detail of her allegations. Her account was that the first incident of indecent assault occurred after they had left the hotel at Artarmon and that the digital penetration occurred at the bar at Kings Cross. The other indecent assault and the penile penetration are said to have occurred after she left the Crows Nest hotel with the plaintiff. 
     
      
    7 In the statement, the complainant said that she had a number of alcoholic drinks, such that she became affected at one stage. Aspects of her behaviour throughout the night could raise a question whether she was willing to have sexual contact with the plaintiff or, at least, whether that behaviour might have conveyed to him that she was. However, she said that during the act of penile penetration, the last of the offences alleged, she protested and struggled. In the course of so doing, she said, “I am a Christian. How could you do this to me?” At the conclusion of the statement, she said that she was scared at the time of the offences and that she did not want to lose her virginity “in such a manner due to my beliefs and personal morals.” 
     
      
    8 The plaintiff sought a direction that the complainant attend the committal proceedings for cross-examination primarily to examine her consumption of alcohol, the behaviour suggesting that she might have been sexually available, and the inconsistency between that behaviour and her assertion that her Christian moral standards would not permit her to have consensual sexual contact with the plaintiff. The opportunity was also sought to examine more closely her account of the incident of penile intercourse. To secure the complainant’s attendance, the plaintiff had to satisfy the Magistrate that there were “special reasons why… in the interests of justice,” that direction should be made: s 93 of the Criminal Procedure Act.  
     
      
    9 The principal focus of the argument before me was the evidence of the complainant’s moral standards founded upon her Christianity. In its context, her assertion at the time of the last alleged offence that she was a Christian conveyed of itself that she would be unwilling to have extra marital sexual intercourse. In any event, apart from the passage in her first statement expressing her fear of losing her virginity to which I have referred, there was other material in the prosecution brief bearing on the matter. This included part of her third statement to the police, in which she revealed her relationship with a boy she met in a Christian organisation while she was still at school. She said that towards the end of that relationship she went to “second base with him”, albeit rarely. By “second base” she meant allowing him to penetrate her digitally. She described these occasions as “experimenting”, and added that they both felt that it was wrong because of their beliefs.  
     
      
    10 Clearly, this material conveys that at the time of the alleged offences she was a virgin and that her sexual experience was limited to that which she described in her third statement. It would be evidence of sexual experience or the lack of it, coming within the terms of s 293 of the Criminal Procedure Act. That section provides that evidence of that kind is inadmissible unless it falls within one of the exceptions set out in the section. The general prohibition upon admission of the evidence is to be found in subs (3), which provides:  
     
      
       
        
        (3) Evidence that discloses or implies: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that the complainant has or may have had sexual experience or a lack of sexual experience, or  
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) has or may have taken part or not taken part in any sexual activity, 
          
         
        
       
       
      is inadmissible. 
       
      
    11 The plaintiff was represented in the Local Court and in this Court by Mr Walsh, solicitor. In the Local Court he argued that the evidence fell within the exception to be found in subs (6), which is as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        (6) If the court is satisfied: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (a) that it has been disclosed or implied in the case for the prosecution against the accused person that the complainant has or may have, during a specified period or without reference to any period: 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (i) had sexual experience, or a lack of sexual experience, of a general or specified nature, or 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
           
            
            (ii) had taken part in, or not taken part in, sexual activity of a general or specified nature, and 
            
           
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          (b) the accused person might be unfairly prejudiced if the complainant could not be cross-examined by or on behalf of the accused person in relation to the disclosure or implication,  
          
         
        
       
       
        
        the complainant may be so cross-examined, but only in relation to the experience or activity of the nature (if any) so specified during the period (if any) so specified. 
        
       
      
    12 The application for a direction that the complainant and the other witnesses attend the committal proceedings was first argued before a magistrate other than Magistrate Huber. For reasons which need not concern us, that magistrate disqualified herself from dealing with the matter before giving a decision. It was then that the case became before Magistrate Huber. By that time, the DPP solicitor appearing for the prosecution had decided that she would not tender any evidence touching upon the complainant’s Christianity and sexual morals and that the prosecution brief should be edited accordingly. Mr Walsh objected to this course but, for the purpose of ruling on the objection, her Honour received the whole brief with the passages to be edited out identified by underlining.  
     
      
    13 Mr Walsh accepted that, subject to the exceptions set out in s 293, the evidence was inadmissible. In this respect, the case has some similarity to R v Linskey (1986) 23 A Crim R 224, a case concerned with a predecessor of s 293 (s 409B of the Crimes Act 1900). However, he argued that the present case fell within the exception in s 293(6) on the basis that the material bearing upon the complainant’s sexual experience had been “disclosed… in the case for the prosecution.” That being so, he submitted, the plaintiff might be “unfairly prejudiced” if the complainant could not be cross-examined about that material: subs (6)(b).  
     
      
    14 In support of the argument that the evidence had been disclosed in the prosecution case, Mr Walsh relied upon the unedited brief which, in accordance with the normal procedure, had been served upon him as the plaintiff’s legal representative. However, in ruling on the objection, her Honour held that that was not disclosure for the purpose of subs (6). She held that the subsection, by its reference to disclosure “in the case for the prosecution”, is directed at the case presented by the prosecution at the hearing of the matter. As the prosecution did not intend to lead the evidence in question in the committal proceedings, subs (6) was not applicable. It became unnecessary, then, for her Honour to determine the question posed by subs (6)(b), that is, whether the plaintiff might have been unfairly prejudiced by the lack of an opportunity to cross-examine the complainant at the committal stage. 
     
      
    15 Mr Walsh submitted that in this decision her Honour fell into error, so as to vitiate her subsequent decision that there were no special reasons, within the meaning of s 93, why the complainant should be required to attend for cross-examination. In my view, however, her Honour’s decision was clearly correct. Section 293(6) is concerned with the case presented by the prosecution at a hearing, whether in committal proceedings or at trial. Regardless of the nature of the case, it is not uncommon for the prosecution, in discharge of its duty of disclosure to the defence, to serve material which is not admissible in its case and upon which it does not propose to rely. That material does not become part of the prosecution case simply because it was served. 
     
      
    16 Counsel for the Director of Public Prosecutions in this Court, Ms Dowling, referred me to a decision of Hulme DCJ (as he then was) in R v Baden Cram [2008] NSWDC 225, in which at [19] his Honour took the same view. An observation to that effect was also made by Giles JA (with whom James and Harrison JJ agreed) in Rolfe v R [2007] NSWCCA 155, 173 A Crim R 168 at [55], although the matter did not need to be decided in that case.  
     
      
    17 As I have said, it would seem that in the present case the prosecutor in the Local Court made the decision not to tender the relevant material only after the matter had been argued before the first magistrate. This led to a further argument by Mr Walsh that she had sought unfairly to tailor the prosecution evidence so as to bypass the proper operation of s 293(6). He advanced this as itself a special reason for requiring the attendance of the complainant for cross-examination. He referred to R v Rymer [2005] NSWCCA 310, 156 A Crim R 84, and Mahmood v Western Australia [2008] HCA 1, 232 CLR 397. He also relied upon recent pronouncements about the duty of fairness of a prosecutor by the High Court in Subramaniam v The Queen [2004] HCA 51, 79 ALJR 116 at [54], and by the Court of Criminal Appeal in R v Livermore [2006] NSWCCA 334, 67 NSWLR 659 at [48]. 
     
      
    18 Her Honour rejected this argument both in her initial ruling and in her later judgment dealing comprehensively with the application for a direction that the complainant and other witnesses attend to give evidence. In that later judgment she distinguished Rymer and Mahmood, each of which was a case in which a prosecutor had declined to lead evidence favourable to the accused which was admissible. She pointed out that the evidence in the present case was clearly inadmissible, so that the prosecutor’s decision not to lead it was appropriate. 
     
      
    19 Mr Walsh challenged that decision also in this Court but, again, it was clearly correct. The evidence was inadmissible because of s 293, and the prosecutor’s determination not to tender it was in the proper discharge of her responsibility. 
     
      
    20 Finally, in relation to s 293, Mr Walsh argued that the evidence could bring the case within s 293(4)(b). That paragraph creates an exception to the general provision in subs (3) that evidence of a complainant’s sexual experience is inadmissible if the evidence “relates to a relationship that was existing or recent at the time of the commission of the alleged prescribed sexual offence, being a relationship between the accused person and the complainant…”. Her Honour rejected this argument also, referring to R v Henning & Ors (CCA, unreported, 11 May 1990).  
     
      
    21 In that case the Court, comprising Gleeson CJ, Campbell and Mathews JJ, had occasion to consider a predecessor of s 293(4)(b), s 409B(3)(b) of the Crimes Act. In a joint judgment, their Honours considered the then recent decision of R v White (CCA, unreported, 13 December 1989), in which it was held that limited, casual contact between the complainant and the accused, including a chance meeting and a conversation between the two on the day the sexual assault was said to have occurred, did not constitute a relationship between them for the purpose of that provision. The Court in White considered dictionary definitions of “relationship”, including one in the Macquarie dictionary which was seen to be relevant: “an emotional connection between people, sometimes involving sexual relations.” 
     
      
    22 In Henning, their Honours continued (at pp 75-6): 
     
      
       
        
        “Putting aside for a moment the temporal requirements of paragraph (3)(b), it would seem to follow from  
        White 
         that an emotional and/or a sexual connection between the parties will ordinarily, although not necessarily always, be the basis for concluding that there is a “relationship” between them. We say and/or a sexual connection, for we do not consider in the circumstances that the emotional aspect is as important as the sexual one. We are, after all, considering the matter in the context of an alleged sexual assault.” 
        
       
      
    23 Her Honour observed that in the present case there was no evidence at all that the complainant and the plaintiff were in any kind of sexual relationship. The evidence established no more than that they were work colleagues and friends. Accordingly, there was no basis upon which the exception in s 293(4)(b) could be established. Mr Walsh challenged this decision in the proceedings before me but, yet again, no error has been shown in her Honour’s approach.  
     
      
    24 Of these three matters, whether there had been disclosure of the complainant’s sexual experience, for the purpose of s 293(6), and whether the complainant’s friendship with the plaintiff amounted to a relationship, for the purpose of subs (4), could be said to be questions of law, so as to enliven this Court’s jurisdiction to grant leave to appeal under s 53(3)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. However, it does not appear to me that the argument that the prosecutor in the Local Court had sought to tailor the evidence to frustrate the operation of s 293(6) raises a question of law. I make no comment about whether any of these three matters might have justified declaratory or prerogative relief if error had been shown.  
     
      
    25 The other aspects of her Honour’s reasons, also challenged by Mr Walsh, raise no question of law and could not provide a basis for any of the relief sought. They can be dealt with briefly. 
     
      
    26 As far as the attendance of the complainant was concerned, her Honour found no special reasons in any of the other matters relied upon by Mr Walsh. One of those matters, that the complainant tongue kissed another man at the Crows Nest Hotel, was clearly inadmissible by virtue of s 293(3). As to the remaining matters, her Honour found either that they did not have the significance for which Mr Walsh contended, or that they were sufficiently canvassed in the complainant’s statements so that the interests of justice did not require that they be explored at the committal stage. 
     
      
    27 Her Honour was guided by authority on the scope of the expression “special reasons” in s 93 of the Criminal Procedure Act. In particular, she set out an oft quoted passage from the judgment of Hunt CJ at CL in R v Kennedy (1997) 94 A Crim R 341. Dealing with the use of the expression in a predecessor of the current provision, s 48EA of the Justices Act 1902, and drawing on requisite authorities, the Chief Judge said (at 352): 
     
      
       
        
         
          
          “What are ‘special reasons’ and what are not will vary from case to case and cannot be defined in advance. The decision should not be approached in an unduly restrictive way; what must be shown is that such evidence will serve the true purposes of committal proceedings, which exist in order to achieve a fair trial in the trial court. Something more than the disadvantage to the accused from the loss of the opportunity to cross-examine the complainant at the committal must be shown. There must be some feature of the particular case by reason of which it is out of the ordinary and which establish (sic) that it is in the interests of justice that the complainant be called to give oral evidence. Two cross-examinations are not justified simply in order to find material in order to discredit the witness at the trial. 
          
         
        
       
       
        
         
          
          Solid grounds must be disclosed for supposing that the cross-examination will make a significant contribution to the achievement of a fair trial. The clear message conveyed by all of the cases which I have read is that cross-examination at the committal proceedings will be permitted only where there is at least a serious risk of an unfair trial if it is not.” (Footnotes omitted.) 
          
         
        
       
      
    28 Her Honour dealt with these matters in the proper exercise of her jurisdiction. In any event, her conclusion was clearly open and, here also, I can see no error in her approach.  
     
      
    29 As to the three witnesses who were directed to attend, her Honour found that there were substantial reasons why, in the interests of justice, they should attend to give evidence: s 91(3) of the Criminal Procedure Act, but only in respect of certain matters: subs (7). Broadly speaking, she allowed all three of them to be cross-examined about their observations of the interaction between the complainant and the plaintiff on the night in question and any comments the complainant made about him that night. Here also, her Honour referred to authority on the expression “substantial reasons”, including what she described as a “useful overview” of the principles by Whealy J in Sim v Magistrate Corbett & Anor [2006] NSWSC 665 at [20]. 
     
      
    30 Her Honour found that the other matters about which Mr Walsh wished to cross-examine those witnesses did not disclose substantial reasons for his being allowed to do so. Before me, his complaint about this finding was directed to one only of those matters: a brief conversation between the complainant and her step-sister which, it was said, could bear on the issue of consent. The argument was only faintly pressed. It is sufficient to say that it was open to her Honour to conclude that the incident did not provide a substantial reason for cross-examination of the witness and, yet again, no error has been shown. 
     
      
    31 Accordingly, no basis for this Court’s intervention has been established. I would refuse leave to appeal under s 53(3)(a) of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act, and would also refuse the declaratory and prerogative relief sought. The proceedings in this Court were instituted by summons. That summons is dismissed. If necessary, I shall hear the parties on costs.

     R v TODOROSKI 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 ALLSOP P: I have had the advantage of reading the reasons of Grove J. I agree with them, and with the order proposed by his Honour. In these circumstances, it is inappropriate to deal with any Constitutional issue that was put forward on behalf of Mr Todoroski impugning the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (the “CAR Act”), s 68A. 
     
      
    2 One group of issues should, however, be mentioned. These are not, strictly speaking, Constitutional issues, though they may be seen to be of a similar character. Mr Todoroski’s conviction was for an offence under a law of the Commonwealth Parliament. The criminal proceeding and the appeal were in the exercise of federal criminal jurisdiction. The argument was put that the CAR Act, s 68A was not “picked up” by any of the possibly relevant provisions of the Judiciary Act 1903 (Cth), being ss 68, 79 and 80. 
     
      
    3 This was said to be so for a number of reasons, which included the Constitutional invalidity of s 68A. As I said, I do not propose to deal with those Constitutional issues. 
     
      
    4 Reliance was also placed on the decision of the Full Court of the Tasmanian Supreme Court in R v Talbot [2009] TASSC 107. This was a Crown appeal against sentence that involved a Commonwealth offence concerning child pornography. The Court (Blow J, with whom Crawford CJ and Porter J agreed) was required to consider the Criminal Code Act 1924 (Tas), s 402 (4A) which (though in somewhat different terms) dealt with double jeopardy as did the CAR Act, s 68A. Section 402 (4A) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        (4A)  
        The Court, on hearing an appeal that does or may require it to impose a sentence, or to vary a sentence imposed, on a person for an offence (whether the appeal was brought, made or lodged by the person or by the prosecutor) –  
         
         
        (a) 
         may take into account any matter relevant to the sentence that has occurred between when the court of trial dealt with the person and when the appeal is heard; but 
         
         
        (b) 
         despite paragraph (a), must not take into account the fact that the Court's decision may mean that the person is again sentenced for the crime.” 
         
        
       
      
    5 The approach of the Court was set out in [19] of Blow J’s reasons, as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “[19] The Commonwealth has not introduced any legislation preventing a court that allows a Crown appeal against sentence from taking into account the fact that an unsuccessful respondent is to be sentenced a second time for the same crime. Under the  
        Crimes Act 1914 
         (Cth),  
        s16A(1) 
        , when a court is determining the sentence to be passed for a federal offence, that court must impose a sentence ‘that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence’. Prior to the enactment of s402(4A), it was clear that ‘double jeopardy’ in the re-sentencing process following a successful Crown appeal was to be taken into account in favour of the respondent:  
        R v Hayes 
          
        (1987) 29 A Crim R 452 
        ;  
        R v Clarke 
         [[1996] 2 VR 520)];  
        R v Harland-White 
         23/1997;  
        Dinsdale v R 
          
        [2000] HCA 54 
        ;  
        (2000) 202 CLR 321 
        ;  
        Attorney-General v McDonald 
         [(2002) 11 Tas R 221]. In my view s402(4A)(b) is inconsistent with the general requirement in  
        s16A(1) 
         to impose a sentence that is of appropriate severity, and therefore does not apply to re-sentencing under Commonwealth legislation:  
        Constitution 
        ,  
        s109. 
         Counsel did not submit otherwise at the hearing of the appeal.” 
        
       
      
    6 Section 16A(1) of the Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) is in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
         
        “(1) In determining the sentence to be passed, or the order to be made, in respect of any person for a federal offence, a court must impose a sentence or make an order that is of a severity appropriate in all the circumstances of the offence.” 
        
       
      
    7 The approach of the Court in Talbot was: 
     
      
       
      (a) to construe the  
      Crimes Act 1914  
      (Cth), s 16A(1) as containing as part of its content the relevant common law, including the principle of “double jeopardy”; and 
       
       
      (b) to conclude thereby that a State law which purported to abolish double jeopardy was inconsistent with the  
      Crimes Act 
      , s 16A(1) under the Australian Constitution, s 109 and was, therefore,  
      pro tanto 
       inoperative. 
       
      
    8 With respect, there may be difficulties in this approach. First, it is not clear that the analysis would begin with s 109, rather than ss 68, 79 and 80 of the Judiciary Act. The co-ordinate operation of s 109, on the one hand, and the “pick up” provisions of the Judiciary Act, on the other, and their order of application is not always an easy question. Generally, any enquiry about s 109 can be seen to be the first part of the analysis, as only operative State law will be picked up. Here, however, an Act of a State Parliament concerning how a court exercises power, on its face, cannot have anything to say about how a court (whether State or Commonwealth) exercises federal jurisdiction. That jurisdiction is of another polity, the Commonwealth. The State Act becomes relevant only through Commonwealth law making it applicable as “surrogate federal law”. Thus, it may be problematic to assert that there could be any inconsistency between the State Act, as such, and the Commonwealth Act, for the purposes of s 109. 
     
      
    9 Secondly, if s 16A(1) does contain all relevant common law, there may be an issue as to its validity: cf Western Australia v The Commonwealth [1995] HCA 47; 183 CLR 373 at [145] and following. 
     
      
    10 Thirdly, s 16A(1) may assume a body of law by reference to which what is “appropriate in all the circumstances” can be judged. Ordinarily, the common law of Australia (to the extent modified by Commonwealth and State statute law) is picked up and made relevant to cases in federal jurisdiction by the Judiciary Act, s 80. 
     
      
    11 Thus, fourthly, there may be a real issue as to the correctness of the construction of s 16A(1) in Talbot. 
     
      
    12 Fifthly, if the construction of s 16A(1) is more limited than identified by Blow J in Talbot, there may be no reason (other Constitutional points aside) why the Judiciary Act, s 80 would not pick up the common law of Australia, modified by the CAR Act, s 68A, and why s 68A itself would not be picked by the Judiciary Act, s 68 or s 79. 
     
      
    13 I do not need to form or express final views on these points; but it seems to me that the above may be at least some of the architecture for any debate about the operation of the CAR Act, s 68A in Crown appeals against sentence on conviction for Commonwealth offences. 
     
      
    14 GROVE J: On 14 August 2009 the respondent was sentenced by Sorby DCJ for an offence of attempting to possess a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug (heroin) contrary to the provisions of the Criminal Code 1995 (Commonwealth). He had pleaded guilty in the Local Court and been committed for sentence. The maximum prescribed penalty in terms of imprisonment for that offence is twenty five years. The respondent was sentenced to imprisonment for 6 years 6 months with a non-parole period of 3 years 9 months. 
     
      
    15 The Crown appeals pursuant to s 5D of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 on the ground that the sentence was manifestly inadequate. Contingent upon the possibility that the ground might be sustained, submissions were presented essentially concerning the application of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) in dealing with an offence against a law of the Commonwealth and concepts of equal justice between the States within the Federation. (After the hearing, the solicitor for the respondent by letter advised that it was no longer sought to argue the “unequal justice” principle.) 
     
      
    16 In the light of the nature of the contingency I turn first to consider whether the ground of appeal has been made out.  
     
      
    17 It was expressly stated in submissions on behalf of the respondent that a “factual overview” set out in Crown written submissions was not disputed. It is convenient to incorporate this: 
     
      
       
        
        “On 3 November 2008 a package was lodged with FedEx in Bangkok. The package was to be sent via airfreight to a ‘Miss Anna Collings’ of ’20 Somme Cres, Milperra, NSW 2214 Australia’. 
        
       
       
        
        No person named Anna Collings lived at 20 Somme Crescent, Milperra. Police investigations confirmed that the residents of 20 Somme Crescent were Barbara and Maurice Reid. Police also subsequently confirmed that another woman, named Julijana Dimoski, resided in a granny flat at the rear of the premises at 20 Somme Crescent. 
        
       
       
        
        The package consigned to Anna Collings of 20 Somme Crescent was to be collected by Julijana Dimoski, on behalf of her brother, the Respondent. Sometime prior to 3 November 2008, the Respondent had asked his sister to take delivery of the package for him and in return he would pay her approximately $2,000. 
        
       
       
        
        On 4 November 2008, the package arrived at the FedEx facility at Alexandria, Sydney. The package was x-rayed and inspected by Customs. It was found to contain 54 glue sticks of assorted sizes. The glue sticks were examined and each was found to contain a small section of approximately 1 cm of glue, followed by a section of grainy off-white powder. 
        
       
       
        
        Forensic examination by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) confirmed that the bulk weight of the off-white powder was 1,136.4g. Subsequent analysis of the powder confirmed that it contained heroin at a purity of 72.9%. The total pure weight of the heroin was 825.7g. 
        
       
       
        
        On 5 and 6 November 2008, the Respondent sent a number of text messages to his sister, Dimoski, providing her with information and instructions regarding the expected delivery of the package. 
        
       
       
        
        In accordance with those instructions, on 5 November 2008, Dimoski waited at 20 Somme Crescent to take delivery of the package, however it did not arrive. On 6 November 2008, the Respondent waited at 20 Somme Crescent to take delivery of the package, but again it did not arrive. The Respondent then sent a message to Dimoski to advise that he was concerned that the package had not arrived. He further instructed Dimoski that if there was a ‘drama’ they would reject the package. 
        
       
       
        
        On 11 November 2008, the AFP attempted to deliver the package to 20 Somme Crescent, Milperra. Barbara Reid told the undercover AFP officer, who was acting as a FedEx courier, that the package had been cancelled and that ‘she no longer wants it’.  
        
       
       
        
        Later that day AFP executed a search warrant at 20 Somme Crescent. Maurice Reid informed the police of the identity of Julijana Dimoski and confirmed that she lived in the granny flat at the rear of the house. Maurice Reid further advised that he had received a package at the address on behalf of Dimoski about a month earlier. 
        
       
       
        
        Subsequent enquiries with Dimoski revealed the identity of her brother, the Respondent. Dimoski advised police that she had been asked by her brother to take delivery of the package at 20 Somme Crescent. Dimoski also advised police that once the package had not arrived on 6 November, she had told Barbara Reid that the package would not be coming and that if a package was delivered it was not what she had been waiting for. 
        
       
       
        
        Later on 11 November 2008, the Respondent was arrested in relation to this matter. The Respondent participated in a taped record of interview with police. During the interview the Respondent stated that he had become involved in the matter at the request of a friend. He stated that the friend had asked him to provide names and addresses to which packages could be sent. He agreed to provide the friend with names and addresses so that false identification documents could be created in case they were required by the delivery company. The Respondent stated that he had previously accepted delivery of a number of packages on behalf of this other person in return for money. 
        
       
       
        
        The Respondent confirmed that he had asked his sister to take delivery of the package seized by police on 4 November. He stated that he was to be paid $2,500 for arranging for the collection of that package and that he was to pay his sister $2,000 and would keep $500. He further confirmed that when the package did not arrive as expected he had advised his sister not to accept the package.” 
        
       
      
    18 In his Remarks on Sentence the judge noted that, upon arrest, the respondent cooperated with police and answered questions in an interview but he added: 
     
      
       
        
        ”The AFP inquiries into the alleged principal – a woman with whom the offender had a relationship and who had absconded overseas – has not resulted in arrests and the AFP has assessed the offender’s assistance as being of little value. The offender did identify the woman, even if she had a false name.” 
        
       
      
    19 As the terms of the ground asserting manifest inadequacy reveal, no specific error by the sentencing judge is contended by the appellant and this stance is confirmed by the final submission that “latent error” should be apparent. 
     
      
    20 The appellant pointed out that the amount of heroin involved was 412 times the threshold of marketable quantity (2 grams) and that the upper estimated figures of street and wholesale values of the drug were $577,990 and $487,028. His Honour made express reference to these in his remarks. 
     
      
    21 The respondent appreciated that the package contained illegal drugs of some sort and he admitted to police that he thought “there might have been cocaine in them or something but nothing too bad.” His Honour found that the respondent’s conduct (as summarized in the above facts) was a “crucial link in the chain of operation” and he assessed the respondent’s culpability to lie towards the upper end of the mid-range of such offences. 
     
      
    22 Although the appellant relied on the single ground abovementioned, reference was made to his Honour’s rejection of the Crown submission that the offence did not represent isolated conduct. The respondent had told police that he had been the recipient of “other packages” but his Honour held that he was “not prepared to draw the inference in the absence of other evidence that the other packages contained any illegal substances”. That finding was consistent with authority that facts adverse to an accused may not be taken into account against the interests of that accused unless they have been established beyond reasonable doubt: The Queen v Olbrich (1999) 199 CLR 270. 
     
      
    23 The appellant submitted: 
     
      
       
        
        “Acceptance of his Honour’s finding does not mean that the Respondent’s earlier conduct was an entirely irrelevant consideration. Whilst it may not have been proved that he actually committed other drug ‘offences’ in the past, it may be readily accepted that he was engaged in a course of conduct which he believed was part of an illegal drug enterprise. This fact was highly relevant to an assessment of the nature and circumstances of the offence and also highly relevant to an assessment of the Respondent’s prior character.” 
        
       
      
    24 A circumstance where “engaging in a course of conduct … believed (to be) ….part of an illegal drug enterprise” would not amount to commission of a “drug offence” is difficult to contemplate. No example was offered. Senior counsel referred to Weininger v The Queen (2003) 212 CLR 629 where, although an offender had no prior convictions, evidence establishing previous participation in drug importation was held to be relevant to diminishing any claim for leniency such as previous good character usually attracts. The situation of the respondent is obviously distinguishable from this in that it was not established, by evidence or from inference, that the “other packages” contained any illegal substances.  
     
      
    25 I would reject the appellant’s submission. 
     
      
    26 The manifest inadequacy of the sentence was sought to be demonstrated by reference to a selection of other cases which were said to be comparable and in some of which observations were made about appropriate ranges of sentence. It is not to criticise this approach that I note that every offence and every offender is different and the essential aim of all sentencing is to render individual justice. Comparable cases and statistics can be useful guides and departure from established sentencing patterns would require justification, but the exercise of sentencing discretion must be directed to fulfilment of the stated aim. 
     
      
    27 It is not necessary for present purposes to recapitulate the circumstances and outcomes of the cases cited and it suffices to record references: R v Wong & anor (1999) 48 NSWLR 340 (note the disapproval of the ‘guideline’ element (2001) 207 CLR 504); R v Rivadavia (2004) 61 NSWLR 63; R v SC [2008] NSWCCA 29; R v Dang [2004] NSWCCA 265; R v Haidar [2004] NSWCCA 350; R v Okeke [2005] NSWCCA 444; Korgbara v R (2007) 170 A Crim R 568; Milich v R [2008] NSWCCA 148; El-Ghourani v R [2009] NSWCCA 140; Onuorah v R [2009] NSWCCA 238; N & anor v R [2009] NSWCCA 108. 
     
      
    28 Against the background of these references it was submitted by the appellant that the head sentence for the respondent ought to have been set (after allowance for the plea of guilty and favourable subjective circumstances) in the range of between seven and ten years imprisonment. It was submitted that, in the light of the finding that the offence was towards the upper end of mid-range seriousness, it should not be perceived that the difference of six months between the head sentence of six and half years and the low point of the range, seven years, would invite mere “tinkering”. 
     
      
    29 No challenge was offered against the proportion of head sentence selected by the judge for the purpose of specifying the non-parole period at 3 years 9 months. Although it is accepted, as has often been stated, that statistics are a blunt tool, the collection of non-parole periods in some fifty cases of importation of a marketable quantity of a border controlled drug by the Judicial Commission is instructive. For this purpose, the fact that the respondent’s offence was an attempt is irrelevant. 
     
      
    30 The collection shows that the non-parole period to be served by the respondent is higher than 60 percent of the entirety of the cases. Counsel for the respondent has observed that, if the non-parole period was but three months longer, that proportion would elevate to 78 percent. 
     
      
    31 Those statistics strongly support a conclusion that the judge’s sentencing discretion has not miscarried. In order to succeed, the appellant is required to show the contrary. In my opinion the sentence imposed represented a sound exercise of sentencing discretion and the ground has not been made out. 
     
      
    32 I would dismiss the appeal. In that circumstance the contingency abovementioned does not arise and I would not find it necessary to comment upon the issues which were sought to be raised.33 HISLOP J: I agree with Grove J.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: Anita Hamson committed a serious offence about a year ago on 10 March 2009. She was with her co-offender, Robert Reddy, when a woman took some money out of an ATM in their vicinity. She was just about to put the money into her wallet when the offender reached over her shoulder and grabbed the money. Not surprisingly, the victim of the offence held onto the money, which caused Ms Hamson to lose her grip. However, they then had a struggle. Ms Hamson would not give in, nor would the victim. During that time, the offender grabbed hold of the victim’s hand, which caused small scratches to her right thumb and right little finger. After the struggle ended, the victim tried to get away, but the co-offender, Mr Reddy, prevented her from doing so. However, she managed to push past Mr Reddy and run away, where she fell over, suffering more scratches and grazes. Ms Hamson and Mr Reddy gave up, and walked away, but the victim recognised them later on, after having been treated in hospital for her injuries, and they were arrested 2 Ms Hamson was interviewed by police, and while she admitted being there, she denied the allegation she tried to take money from the victim. That, of course, was not true. She was charged, and, while she was released to bail, she was re-arrested the following day. She remained in custody for a total of sixty-nine days, until she got Supreme Court bail. 3 She first came before me in September last year. It was at that stage that Ms Hamson’s lawyer, Ms Sanders, asked that I grant her client the benefit of a s 11 remand so that Ms Hamson could attend Biyani House. The Crown did not oppose that. There were indications at that stage that Ms Hamson was capable of rehabilitating herself, and so I gave her the opportunity of demonstrating to me that she should not receive a sentence of full-time custody, a sentence that, on one view, she richly deserved.4 The matter came back before me more recently in February this year when Ms Sanders asked that I adjourn the matter until today and continue the s 11 remand.5 I now have before me a number of reports about Ms Hamson and her progress to date. Ms Hamson was born in Melbourne. Her mother and father separated, with her mother taking the offender and her sister to Newcastle when Ms Hamson was about six. Ms Hamson has sometimes lived with her father and other times with her mother, although she has not recently spoken to her mother with any great regularity. She does, however, have a close relationship with her father and also with her sister. She left school in year nine, and has not yet completed her school certificate. She has had some work in the past, but her major occupation to date has been as a sex worker. Consistent with that activity, she has been a regular drug user, using cannabis at fifteen and later other drugs including heroin. At one stage she was on the methadone program. 6 When she came before me in September last year there were indications that Ms Hamson was willing and able to put her life of crime behind her. She has other offences on her criminal history apart from the one that I must sentence her for, but there were suggestions that with some help, Ms Hamson might be able to turn her life around. That has largely proved to be the case. I say “largely” because of one significant blip in Ms Hamson’s rehabilitation. Ms Hamson was with Biyani for a number of months and was accepted into the Stepping Out program as a means of re-entering the community. However, Ms Hamson was found to have consumed drugs; cannabis on two or three occasions, as well as amphetamines. This would ordinarily result in her being excluded from the Stepping Out program because of their strict requirement that a person has six months drug free before they can be accepted into their program. However, those that are in control of the Stepping Out program must have been impressed with Ms Hamson, because they made a significant exception to her. They have allowed her to enter the Stepping Out program on a trial period. 7 Part of her re-entry into the community involves living with her father on the weekends, and on occasions midweek, re-establishing contact with her father and sister, going to TAFE, studying and working hard. There is much to suggest that Ms Hamson is capable of turning her life around and becoming a worthwhile citizen and a person who is proud of herself. 8 There remains, however, the concern about her recent drug use. She explained in evidence that it was primarily due to the problems of living in Biyani with, in particular, a rather difficult resident. It seems that not only other residents such as Ms Hamson, but also staff found a great deal of difficulty in dealing with one particular resident, and this affected the entire household. It was in those circumstances that Ms Hamson says that she succumbed to temptation to smoke cannabis and consume drugs. Despite that blip, Ms Hamson’s progress has been generally satisfactory. She gave evidence today that she herself recognises that drugs do nothing for her. In one sense, she says, it has been good that she consumed those drugs, because she realises now that they are no longer for her. 9 This is, of course, a matter where I cannot lose sight of the fact that a perfectly innocent person was assaulted with intent that she be robbed by the offender who was in company with another person. People are entitled to use ATMs without drug users, such as Ms Hamson was, attempting to rob them of money which is legitimately theirs, especially in circumstances where they are injured. Ordinarily, therefore, because of Ms Hamson’s serious offence, she would go into full-time custody. She has done sixty-nine days bail refused in this matter, but objectively on one view she should do much more because of the seriousness of her misconduct. On the other hand, as I have expressed earlier when dealing with Ms Hamson, it is in the community’s interests for Ms Hamson to be rehabilitated. If she leaves her offending behaviour behind, then the community is better off.10 I am satisfied that I should impose a sentence on Ms Hamson which focuses on her rehabilitation. But one way that it does that is by ensuring that if she does relapse she will be significantly punished. I should note that Ms Hamson pleaded guilty at an early time to this offence. I will not separately quantify the discount that I have allowed for that matter, but say that it is one of a number of matters that have led to me imposing a different form of sentence than I would otherwise.11 The order I make is this, the offender is sentenced to imprisonment. The imprisonment period is eighteen months. I suspend the execution of that sentence under s 12 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. It is a condition of the suspension, of course, that Ms Hamson enter into a bond to be of good behaviour. The conditions of that bond are, not only that she is to be of good behaviour but also that she participate in the Stepping Out program and follow the reasonable directions of that service in order to maintain her accommodation and address her underlying issues as regards drug use, her mental health and sexual assault counselling.12 Ms Hamson is also to continue to attend TAFE and to apply herself to her studies. When appropriate she is to actively seek employment. She is to comply with mental health treatment as directed by a medical practitioner. She is to continue to engage with drug and alcohol counselling and treatment. And she is to be subjected to random but frequent urinalysis in order to ensure that Ms Hamson consumes no illegal drugs whatsoever. 13 Ms Hamson, I want you to listen very carefully to what I’ve got to say. I have got a document before me that says that should future drug use be detected, you should be put in a residential rehabilitation program. Now, that is not going to happen. If drug use is detected, there is only one place you are going to be residing, and that is in custody. Ms Sanders is going to, no doubt, tell you that I generally put people like you in gaol without much hesitation. And it is most unusual for me to spend so much time on a person like yourself, giving them s 11 remands and seeing you regularly as I have. Usually, I would put you straight into gaol without much hesitation. So, not only have Stepping Out taken an unusual course for them, but I have taken an unusual course for me. But, what that means is that if you disappoint me, I am going to have no hesitation in putting you in gaol, do you understand that? So, next time you are under a bit of stress, next time you get the opportunity to consume drugs, you are going to think about a number of things. One of the things I want you to think about is, “if I consume this drug, I am going to be found out and I am going to go to gaol”. Think about that when you decide whether it is worth it or not. Do you understand? All right, thank you very much for your assistance, Mr Crown and Ms Sanders.

   REMARKS ON SENTENCE1. The offender, Ronnie Ayoub, is before me for sentence having been found guilty by a jury on 2 March 2010 of four offences namely:Count 1: Recklessly inflict actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse. This is an offence under s 61K(a) of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is twenty years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period.Count 2: Sexual intercourse without consent. This is an offence under s 61I of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is fourteen years imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of seven years.Counts 3 and 4: Intent to pervert the course of justice. These are offences under s 319 of the Crimes Act 1900 for which the maximum penalty is fourteen years imprisonment. There is no standard non-parole period.2. The offender pleaded not guilty to the charges and there was a trial before a jury at Parramatta that ran for some ten days in February and March 2010. There were two complainants. The first count of recklessly inflict actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse related to Ms CA, then aged fourteen. The offender’s defence to this charge, in essence, was that the events described by Ms CA did not occur at all. The second count of sexual intercourse without consent related to Ms DP, then aged eighteen. The offender’s defence to this charge, in essence, was that Ms DP consented to the sexual intercourse. The jury clearly accepted the evidence presented on behalf of the Crown and, in particular, the evidence of the two complainants. In those circumstances I accept substantially the prosecution case as presented in evidence.3. The relevant facts as I find them may be shortly stated as follows: The Crown case is that on Sunday 1 June 2008 the two complainants were in a room at the Phillip Lodge Motel at Ashfield where Ms DP was staying. At about 5pm that afternoon they telephoned the offender who they knew as Mohammed, an ex-boyfriend of their friend Ms TJS, and invited him over. Mohammed, the offender, was known as Ronnie. In due course, at about 7.45pm, the offender arrived at the motel room in the company of a friend Kian Sijanevanian. It was the Crown case that the plan of the complainants was to “hang out and talk” to the two men. It is clear, however, that at least two of the participants smoked cannabis that evening.Some time after they had been in the motel room with the two young women the offender pulled Ms CA, then aged fourteen, into the bathroom and shut the door. This was subsequent to her teasing him about his clothes and jewellery and saying he looked like a rap singer, Snoop Dog. He replied to the effect that she “had attitude”. Once inside the bathroom the offender pulled down his pants and his underwear to his knees. His penis was, to use Ms CA’s words, “sticking up” and his hand was on his penis pulling it. He then told her to “come down” and started pulling her by the hair towards his penis. She pulled away and said, “No, leave me alone.” The offender got angry and said words to the effect of, “Stop playing childish games.” When Ms CA continued to resist the offender slapped her twice on her left cheek. She yelled out to him telling him to leave her alone and not to touch her and to get away. He continued to try and pull her down and she continued to struggle and pull away and kept saying no, whereupon he tried to pull down her top. When she tried to push him away he grabbed her left hand and bit it. She screamed. He said something like, “I wouldn’t hurt you if you just did what I said.” He tried again to pull her down by the hair and she again tried to push him away. He then punched her to the abdomen, using the Dolce and Gabbana ring that he was wearing. It left an imprint on her body. Next, he pushed her back into the sink and her head banged against the corner of the shower recess. Ms CA managed to get to the door, but he blocked it with his foot. She said something like, “Leave me alone. What, do you like hitting girls or something? Does it make you feel tough? Just leave me alone.” And then he punched her to the side of the face with a closed fist to the jaw, once, or possibly twice.At this stage Ms DP came to the bathroom door and when the door was opened she observed the offender with his belt undone and his fly open. She observed Ms CA with tears in her eyes and visibly upset. Ms DP subsequently observed a bruise on Ms CA’s face and on her stomach. I am satisfied that the bruise on the stomach was caused by the Dolce and Gabbana ring that the offender was wearing. Ms CA left the bathroom and went and lay on a bed. A short time later Ms DP and the offender went into the bathroom where they engaged in an act of sexual intercourse during the course of which, after spitting on her hand she took his erect penis and pulled it. Then she placed it in her mouth for about two minutes but stopped because, using her words, “it smelt weird, like he hadn't had a shower for two days.” He told her, “Open your mouth and hold out your tongue”, and when she stuck out her tongue he put his penis on it and pulled it, “like he was wanking himself”. He also put his hand down the front of her shirt inside her bra and grabbed her right breast. He ejaculated over her face and chest leaving semen on her nose, chin and chest. He used tissues to wipe his penis and pushed some down the front of her shirt. He left the bathroom. She used tissues to wipe the semen from her face and then also returned to the bedroom. The jury clearly accepted, and I find, that Ms DP only participated in the sexual intercourse out of fear following upon what she had earlier observed and heard in respect of the offender in relation to Ms CA, as a result of which she feared for her own safety.In addition to the bruising suffered by Ms CA she experienced pain to her jaw, for which she subsequently sought treatment at hospital. Ms DP was later admitted to the Missenden Unit for psychiatric treatment in relation to a condition of depression and was only discharged in mid June of that year. Some months later, on various occasions in September 2008, the offender threatened the complainants in an attempt to persuade them to go to the police and say that they had made the whole thing up, with a view to having the charges against him dropped. On one occasion, in the vicinity of the Birrong Railway Station, the offender made threats of personal harm to Ms DP on the loud speaker of a mobile phone held by a mutual friend, Ms SB. On other occasions, including an episode at Merrylands, the offender made threats of personal harm to Ms CA and also threats of harm to her family. 4. Section 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 sets out the purposes of sentencing. The purposes for which a court may impose a sentence on an offender are as follows: 
     
      
      (a) To ensure that the offender is adequately punished for the offence; 
       
       
      (b) To prevent crime by deterring the offender and other persons from committing similar offences; 
       
       
      (c) To protect the community from the offender; 
       
       
      (d) To promote the rehabilitation of the offender; 
       
       
      (e) To make the offender accountable for his or her actions; 
       
       
      (f) To denounce the conduct of the offender; 
       
       
      (g) To recognise the harm done to the victim of the crime and the community. 
       
       
       
      
    5. Each of the offences was objectively serious and in my view, for reasons I will come to, no sentence other than imprisonment would be appropriate for each offence.6. There having been no plea of guilty there can be no utilitarian discount applied to any of the sentences.7. The standard non-parole period in respect of the second offence is intended for middle range offences where the offender is convicted after trial. Even if not applicable, that period acts as a guidepost.8. Count 1 involved the infliction of actual bodily harm with intent to have sexual intercourse relates to Ms CA. There was no planning involved and the offender was present at the request of the victim in the motel room. The jury, however, clearly concluded that the offender intended to have sexual relations with Ms CA. It is clear that when she refused to participate he became violent and caused the actual bodily harm I have described. Notwithstanding the actual bodily harm, although serious, it was not substantial, resulting only in bruising and discomfort to the jaw, not requiring any significant medical treatment. The offence was objectively serious and in my assessment the severity was at or just below the mid range for this type of offence. 9. Count 2 involved sexual intercourse without consent in respect of Ms DP. Similarly this offence did not involve planning and occurred after an invitation to the offender to attend at the motel room. Ms DP was then aged eighteen. An act of oral sexual intercourse took place in the bathroom which, the jury concluded, she did not consent to by reason of fear having regard to the events involving Ms CA. There were no express threats made by the offender to Ms DP, nor did she actively protest to the effect that she did not wish to participate in sexual intercourse. In those circumstances I am satisfied that the offender’s knowledge of her absence of consent, that is, his guilty state of mind in that regard, was formed recklessly because he failed to consider whether or not Ms DP was consenting and went ahead with the act of sexual intercourse because he never turned his mind to the question of consent even though he realised the possibility that she was not consenting. The offence was objectively serious, but for these reasons, in my assessment, the severity was below the mid range, albeit just below that mid range, for this type of offence. 10. Counts 3 and 4 relate separately to each complainant. It could not be said that these offences did not involve some degree of planning but I take no additional account of that as I agree with the submission that this was an essential part of the nature of these offences. The offences also involved threats of personal harm and, in the case of Ms CA, the threats were made on more than one occasion and included threats against her family. Whilst no violence occurred, nor was there any actual interference with the course of justice in the ultimate outcome, it must be remembered that these offences strike at the integrity of the judicial process and as such are deserving of a sentence reflecting a significant element of deterrence. In the case of Ms DP, being Count 3, the offence was objectively serious and I assess that severity at below the mid range for this type of offence. In the case of Ms CA, however, I assess the objective severity at the mid range for this type of offence.11. The offender has previous criminal convictions as to minor matters of goods in custody occurring some nine or ten years ago but these are not relevant to the current offences for which I am sentencing him. 12. This is his first time in gaol. During the time he has been in prison he has been housed in protective custody. This has meant that he has not been able to participate in the full range of prison activities such as employment. This is likely to be the situation for the full term of his imprisonment. 13. It was agreed by defence counsel and the Crown that the period of imprisonment already served is to be taken into account such that the starting date for the sentences should be 27 February 2010.14. The offender did not give any evidence either at the trial or at the sentence hearing. There were, however, some testimonials to which I will refer in due course.15. It is evident from the pre-sentence report provided by the Probation and Parole Service that the offender remains in denial as to his guilt in relation to these offences. As a result he has demonstrated no remorse or contrition. Similarly, he has shown no insight “with respect to self-responsibility in regards to sexual boundaries”. 16. Indeed, he apparently expressed surprise at the outcome of the trial and continues to maintain his denial of physical contact with the younger victim Ms CA, notwithstanding the objective corroborative evidence as to the injuries he inflicted upon her. He presented himself to Probation and Parole “as the victim of defamation and acts of a revengeful ex-girlfriend.”17. In summary then, there are no aggravating factors to be taken into account but there are a number mitigating factors to which I have adverted. In addition there are relevant subjective factors. In this regard I turn to the psychological report tendered and to the testimonials tendered.18. The offender is a single male now aged thirty-one. He was twenty-eight at the time of the offences. Prior to imprisonment he was in regular employment since leaving school. He was raised by his mother for the first six years of life and then had no contact with her for twenty years. He presented to the psychologist as severely depressed with symptoms of self disturbance, appetite disturbance, weight loss, impaired concentration, distractibility, apathy, lack of energy, emotional liability and teariness. 19. In relation to the testimonials, these establish that prior to these offences this offender was a well-behaved young man. Indeed there is evidence of him having participated in the community in a number of ways that were positive. I am grateful to Mr Conwell for his dot point summary on page 2 of his written submissions where he outlines some of the essential features of those testimonials. These include descriptions of the offender as a man who is generous and compassionate, always keen to help people in need, highly regarded in the community for volunteer work, had sound family values, was well-mannered with high moral and social values, who participated regularly in volunteer work. Apart from the description of him as a man with high morals and social values, I accept all of the other matters set out in the testimonials.20. Counsel made some submissions as to the prospects of rehabilitation. These included his previous good character, his strong family ties, his age and the absence of convictions relevant to these types of offences. Unfortunately, an assessment of the risk of sexual re-offending has not been carried out on the offender due to his movement between Correctional Centres. This will be carried out after sentencing through the Probation and Parole Service Sex Offenders Programmes Unit with a view to identifying static and dynamic factors contributing to the offences and to enable referral of the offender to appropriate therapeutic programmes. A minimum of twelve months is required to enable assessment and programme participation. Only after that is completed will he be able to be assessed for participation in community maintenance programmes and the level of monitoring required by the Service.21. Having regard to these factors, and in addition to the matters that I have set out from the psychological report and the testimonials, I conclude that there are in fact good prospects of rehabilitation in respect of this offender. Having regards to the matters to which I have adverted, there are a number of circumstances involved here which are relevant to the assessment of the non-parole and parole periods and their relativity. I find special circumstances.22. Turning to the question of totality I observe that sentences for multiple offences should generally only be made concurrent where the sentence for one offence comprehends the criminality of the other offences. In this case there were separate victims and in my view the offences here were separate and distinct, and each one involved separate and additional criminality. Accordingly wholly concurrent sentences would not be appropriate. In my view, however, the overall criminality in respect of these offences requires only that the sentences be partially accumulated, or at least that some of them should be partially accumulated.23. JIRS statistics were presented to me. Such statistics can only ever be used as an indicator and each individual sentence must be tailored to the specific circumstances involved. Having regard to the very small sample involved in the statistics presented I believe I should not have significant regard to them in this case.24. Mr Ayoub, on being found guilty by the jury you are convicted of each of the four offences. On the third count I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of nine months to commence on 27 February 2010 and to conclude on 26 November 2010. On the fourth count I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of twelve months to commence on 27 May 2010 and to conclude on 26 May 2011. On the first count I sentence you to a fixed term of imprisonment of two years to commence on 27 August 2010 and to conclude on 26 August 2012. On the second count I sentence you to a non-parole period of imprisonment of two years to commence on 27 February 2011 and to conclude on 26 February 2013. I set an additional period of imprisonment of eighteen months from 27 February 2013 to 26 August 2014.The total sentence is, therefore, four years and six months with an effective non-parole period of three years. I order that you be eligible for release to parole on 26 February 2013.

     REGINA v PATRICK READ 
      
      
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 GILES JA: The respondent pleaded guilty to two charges of dangerous driving occasioning grievous bodily harm, an offence under s 53A(3)(c) of the Crimes Act 1900. The offences were committed on 4 April 2009. The same dangerous driving resulted in injury to two persons, hence the two charges. 
     
      
    2 The offence carries a maximum penalty of 7 years imprisonment. The respondent was sentenced by Robison DCJ to imprisonment for concurrent non-parole periods of 12 months with balances of term of 12 months, to be served by way of periodic detention. 
     
      
    3 The Crown appeals against the sentences on the grounds - 
     
      
       
      “(1) His Honour erred by imposing completely concurrent sentences. 
       
       
      (2) His Honour erred in not giving sufficient weight to the aspects of general deterrence and the objective seriousness of the offence and in giving too much weight to the subjective features of the applicant [sic: respondent]. 
       
       
      (3) The sentence pronounced was [sic] manifestly inadequate.” 
       
       
      Facts 
       
      
    4 The respondent was 20 years old and a university student. He drove to a fancy dress 19th birthday party at an address in Minnamorra Avenue, Earlwood. On the way he purchased a 700ml bottle of bourbon and a bottle of coca-cola. The respondent arrived at the party between 6pm and 7pm. Over the next three and a half hours he drank approximately three-quarters of the bottle of bourbon mixed with coca-cola. He had not eaten any food since lunchtime. 
     
      
    5 At about 10.40 pm the respondent got into his vehicle, with the birthday celebrant as his passenger. He drove along Minnamorra Avenue to a cul de sac about 200 metres from the party address, where he performed “donuts”: that is, accelerating harshly and steering to the right and completing revolutions of the vehicle. 
     
      
    6 The respondent then drove back along Minnamorra Avenue and stopped outside the party address. There were many people in the front yard of the party address, and on the nature strip and footpath and in the gutter outside it. The estimates varied between 50 and 100. Numerous cars were parked on both sides of the street. 
     
      
    7 The respondent performed a “burnout”: that is, accelerating harshly whilst braking so that the drive wheels were spinning. There was significant tyre shredding and large volumes of smoke. One of the wheels created a trench in the road surface, and the smoke completely surrounded the vehicle and the area so that the respondent could not see ahead of him. 
     
      
    8 The respondent then drove the vehicle forward, with the drive wheels still spinning under acceleration. The front passenger side of the vehicle collided with the driver’s side doors and quarter panel of a car parked directly outside the party address. The vehicle continued forward, under the acceleration but at moderate speed. The front of the vehicle collided heavily with the rear of another car parked outside the next door address. 
     
      
    9 The collision shunted the last-mentioned car forward about 10 metres. Two persons, Ms Natasha Minzevska (aged 19) and Ms Jessica Lei (age 20), were sitting in the gutter in front of the car. The shunted car ran over the legs and feet of both of them. 
     
      
    10 Ms Minzevska suffered compound fractures of the tibia and fibula in her right leg and severe bruises to the left leg. She underwent surgery, including the insertion of 8 screws and a plate. The wounds became infected, and the healing process was delayed. Ms Lei suffered fractures to the bones in her right ankle and foot and bruising to her left foot, together with scratches and grazes and bruising to her face. She also underwent surgery, with the insertion of 7 screws and a plate. 
     
      
    11 Immediately after the collision the respondent went into the party address and retrieved his belongings. He returned to his vehicle and saw the damage to it, and was made aware of the injured persons. He attempted to start the vehicle, but could not. He left the scene, and was later arrested by police some distance away.  
     
      
    12 The respondent was breath tested and returned a reading of 0.092. He was granted bail.  
     
      
    13 On the next day, 5 April 2009, the respondent reported to the police and participated in a recorded interview. He made admissions as to being impaired and intoxicated while driving, conducting donuts and the burnout, and causing the collisions. He told the police that he left the scene because people there were turning on him and he seriously feared for his safety. The judge appears to have accepted this, while commenting that he had a “lingering concern that he could have taken more steps in order to check on the welfare of the two victims”. 
     
      
       
      The Respondent’s Driving Record 
       
      
    14 Early in the remarks on sentence the judge said that the respondent had no criminal history “but he does have a significant number of speeding offences on his traffic record”, and that “for some time now he has thumbed his nose at the law when it comes to driving a motor vehicle at the speeds indicated in the material”. He later referred to the respondent having “a very poor traffic record indeed”, but observed that there were “no prior convictions at all” and that the traffic history did not reveal anything of the nature of “burnouts”. Later again he said that the respondent “has a poor driving record that must be taken into account”.  
     
      
    15 The respondent had obtained his P1 provisional licence on 26 February 2007. He had been fined for speeding on a date in May 2007, on 27 May 2007, on 30 May 2007, on 1 June 2007, on 3 June 2007, on a date in June 2007, on 4 June 2007 and on 6 June 2007 (the unstated dates are obscured in the materials before the Court). The offences were variously exceeding the speed limit by not more than 15 km per hour, by more than 15 km per hour but not more than 30 km per hour, and on one occasion by more than 30 km per hour but not more than 45 km per hour.  
     
      
    16 The respondent’s licence was suspended because of demerit points for 3 months from 16 October 2007 and for 6 months from 22 February 2008. He regained a P1 provisional licence on 23 August 2008, but on 3 October 2008 he exceeded the speed limit by more than 45 km per hour and the licence was suspended on the spot for a further 6 months. The suspension came to an end on 2 April 2009.  
     
      
    17 According to the respondent, his driving on 4 April 2009 was influenced by “the hype of me getting my licence back and drinking for the first time for a long time”. He said that he was showing off and trying to impress his friends.  
     
      
       
      Subjective Matters 
       
      
    18 The respondent was the eldest of four brothers and one step-brother. He had had no contact with his natural father, who had been a violent and drunken parent, for some years. He had a good relationship with his mother, step-father and brothers. 
     
      
    19 He left school at the age of 19. He did a TAFE course in security risk management, and completed a bridging course which allowed him entry to a BA degree course which he commenced in March 2009. He was studying to become a primary school teacher. At the time of sentencing he had successfully completed his first year.  
     
      
    20 He had worked at a variety of casual jobs, but at the time of the offence his only income was a youth allowance. He had sporting ability, and in particular had engaged in soccer at a high level. He was involved in coaching a soccer team at Bankstown Grammar School. 
     
      
    21 There was tendered on the respondent’s behalf a report of Mr Anthony Diment, consultant psychologist. Mr Diment said that the respondent “fits DSM-IV-TR criteria for a chronic depressive illness”, as to which he had -  
     
      
       
        
        “…formally assessed on reliable measures as above average on clinical anxiety and depression. While much of this current ‘distress’ is related to his impending sentence there is evidence that his depression in particular is longer-standing and is related to earlier physical/mental abuse at the hands of a violent father. While he had coped with this to a degree – he was a gifted young soccer player until he sustained a serious finger injury – his depression resurfaced when a girlfriend underwent an abortion and he stabbed himself.” 
        
       
      
    22 The last-mentioned incident was when the respondent was 18. He told Mr Diment that he felt he was “OK now”. Mr Diment observed that the respondent had received only brief psychiatric counselling at the time. Mr Diment was concerned that the depression should be assessed and monitored by appropriate medical personnel.  
     
      
    23 Mr Diment considered that the respondent had blighted his life “by a brief, alcohol-related outburst of inappropriate behaviour influenced by peers he was trying to ‘impress’ in an immature manner”, and that the behaviour given his achievements to that time and “his attempts to overcome a difficult early upbringing” were out of character despite the earlier driving offences. 
     
      
    24 The respondent had arranged for flowers and an apology note to be sent to Ms Minzevska and Ms Lei in hospital. He gave evidence at the sentencing hearing, in which he agreed that he “did a really stupid and foolish act” and that he was showing off and hooning. The judge appears to have accepted what he called “the veracity of his remorse expressed to the two victims”, and noted that Mr Diment recorded that the respondent would like them to know how sorry he was. The judge said at one point, “clearly there is genuine remorse”. 
     
      
    25 A number of references were tendered on the respondent’s behalf attesting to general good character. One referee observed that, although not “privy to the circumstances of the charges before the court”, he inferred from general comments that the respondent felt shame and remorse for what he did and believed that given another chance the respondent would not repeat his mistake. 
     
      
    26 I have referred to what the judge said about the traffic record. His Honour nonetheless expressly found “that [the respondent] is a person of good character”. 
     
      
       
      The Judge’s Remarks on Sentence 
       
      
    27 The remarks on sentence were discursive, and sometimes it is not easy to see the part played in the sentencing by the matters to which his Honour referred. 
     
      
    28 The judge allowed a 25% reduction in sentence for the utilitarian value of pleading at the first available opportunity. As I have indicated, he appears to have accepted that the respondent was remorseful. 29 The judge said that the character references were in his view “important matters of evidence” to which mere lip service should not be paid. He accepted that the respondent acted as he did as a result of the “atmosphere of ‘hype’ when he got his licence back”, saying that while that did not excuse what he did “it does help to explain the background leading up to these rather tragic events”. He referred to the report of Mr Diment, describing as significant what had been said about the respondent fitting the diagnostic criteria for a chronic depressive illness while observing that he was mindful that the respondent was deeply concerned about his own position.  
     
      
    30 The judge said that he noted, at other points that he had regard to, or took into account, or was mindful of, the guideline judgment in R v Whyte [2002] NSWCCA 343; (2002) 55 NSWLR 252 to which the Crown had referred and what was said in it. He set out two passages from the judgment, to the effect that a guideline judgment provided a “check, guide or indicator” and was not to be rigidly or mechanically applied, and said - 
     
      
       
        
        “One has to be very careful in straying too far from what is set forth in a guideline judgment, often it is a matter of fact and degree. Guideline judgments are certainly persuasive, they are important, they set a standard by way of a guideline but I repeat, the judicial discretion is still there. Sentencing judges when they have a discretion must exercise it judicially, not to be swayed by emotion on matters of that kind. I have said in the past and I will say it now, possibly simplistically, but it is important for sentencing judges to communicate remarks on sentences that offenders understand. The punishment must fit the crime and it must fit the offender, they are not mutually exclusive notions. Every case needs to be determined on its own circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    31 Referring to the Crown’s submission “that this is a matter of high moral culpability”, his Honour said that “[v]iews may vary on that” and -  
     
      
       
        
        “This was a young, immature, stupid ‘hoon’ if I could use that terminology. His activities were spurred on by his degree of ‘hype’, his excitement about getting his licence back, and he gave little or no thought to any of the consequences which followed from his offending behaviour. I have taken the view that when one considers the moral culpability it is certainly not at the highest level but it is high, it has to be considered in that context. He decided what he was doing, he showed off to the others.” 
        
       
      
    32 The judge observed that “[g]eneral deterrence looms large in this case”, but that he thought that it was most unlikely that the respondent “will ever conduct this kind of behaviour again”. 
     
      
    33 The dispositive part of the remarks on sentence appears to be - 
     
      
       
        
        “I have asked myself as to an appropriate sentence and that is precisely what a sentencing judge has to do and that is to fix an appropriate sentence mindful of the guideline judgment of  
        Whyte 
          
        and other authorities, mindful of the subjective circumstances and the objective seriousness of the offence. I need to consider the expectations of the community which was effectively also referred to in  
        Whyte 
        . There needs to be a transparency and consistency of the sentencing process. 
        
       
       
        
        I have come to the view that due to the objective seriousness of the offence a sentence of imprisonment is not only warranted but inevitable in this particular instance, particularly having regard to the events of that day, the objective seriousness of the offence, questions of general deterrence. I am mindful of what was said in  
        Whyte 
          
        and other authorities. I have come to the further view that each sentence of imprisonment should be concurrent. 
        
       
       
        
        I appreciate the view of the Crown about that, who has suggested at least some partial accumulation but I consider I have already identified in these remarks why I have come to the view that the sentence [sic] should be concurrent having regard to the proximity of the two victims, this all occurred during the course of one act. Their injuries were similar, not identical but similar, they each received surgery, and I do consider that this is a case which warrants concurrent sentences. 
        
       
       
        
        I have also turned my mind as to how those sentences should be served. The Crown has said they should be served on a full-time basis. Mr Stewart has submitted that the court should consider sentencing the offender on the basis of an order for periodic detention. Those submissions have weighed heavily upon me, indeed this entire sentencing task has weighed heavily upon me. I need to act responsibly in accordance with the principles of law and the other matters to which I have referred. 
        
       
       
        
        The pre-sentence report, which I have read in detail and by and large it confirms other matters which I have referred to in these remarks, asserts inter alia that he is eligible and has been assessed as suitable for periodic detention order but there are some concerns as to how he would cope having regard to his youth and the diagnosis of depression. I have taken that into account as well as the psychological report which is part of exhibit 1. 
        
       
       
        
        I consider that in this particular instance the appropriate sentence is indeed one which warrants an order for periodic detention and I do propose to sentence the offender on the basis of a periodic detention order. I do find when I have considered other matters that special circumstances have indeed been made out, they are as follows, firstly his age, secondly this will be the first time he has been in a custodial environment, thirdly there is the diagnosis of depression and I also consider that his prospects of rehabilitation would be enhanced upon his release after a shorter non-parole period having regard to the statutory relationship between that period and the balance of the term. For those reasons I find special circumstances.” 
        
       
      
    34 The judge then pronounced the sentences. The first identification of the non-parole periods and balances of term was when they were pronounced.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1: Concurrency of Sentences 
       
      
    35 For the present the adequacy of the individual sentences is assumed. It is not entirely clear what the judge meant in saying that he had already identified why he had come to the view that the sentences should be concurrent. As I read the reasons, his Honour had in mind what he then expressed as the proximity of the victims and “this all occurred during the course of one act”, and their injuries were similar although not identical. 
     
      
    36 The Crown submitted that the fact that the injuries were similar was largely irrelevant to concurrency, and that the concurrency failed to reflect that there were two victims of the same conduct of the respondent. Each of Ms Minzevska and Ms Lei suffered grievous bodily harm, it was said, and the sentence for one of the offences did not fully encompass the criminality in the other of the offences. It was said that on proper application of the totality principle, there should have been some accumulation.  
     
      
    37 In R v Janceski [2005] NSWCCA 288, Hunt AJA, with whom Spigelman CJ and Howie J agreed, said of a case where the one action by the offender causes a number of persons to be injured and separate charges are laid in relation to each victim - 
     
      
       
        
        “[22] In this second sub-category, it is easy for the sentencing judge to consider the sentencing process as being related to a single action which has created multiple victims, and therefore to fall into the error of imposing wholly concurrent sentences, each of them having been assessed on the basis that the existence of the multiple victims aggravated that sentence. Section 21A(2)(m) of the  
        Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act  
        1999, which identifies the fact that an offence involved multiple victims as an aggravating factor, may (read in isolation) unfortunately lend credence to that approach. That is how the judge approached his task in the present case. Such an approach overlooks the fact that, in a case such as the present, there are two counts, each identifying one of the victims and each requiring a separate sentence. It is completely contrary to principle to aggravate each of those sentences on the basis that  
        each  
        offence resulted in multiple victims:  
        Regina v Tadrosse  
        [2005] NSWCCA 145 at [28]-[29]. 
        
       
       
        
        [23] In a case falling within the second sub-category, separate sentences should usually be fixed which are made partly concurrent and partly cumulative, each such sentence being appropriate to the existence of only one victim and the aggregate of the sentences reflecting the fact that there are multiple victims resulting from the same action by the offender. The extent to which there should be an overlap in the partial accumulation will depend on what is required to represent the totality of the criminality involved in the one act of the offender. This, it seems to me, follows naturally from  
        Pearce  
        at [45]-[48] – and cases such as  
        Regina v Weldon  
        (2002) 136 A Crim R 55 at [46]-[53] and  
        Regina v Price  
        [2004] NSWCCA 186 at [38], [49] – when applying the general principles relating to the aggregation of sentences to this particular sub-category.” 
        
       
      
    38 More generally, in the application of the totality principle it must be asked whether the sentence for one offence comprehends and reflects the criminality for the other offence. If it does not, the sentences should be at least partially cumulative, and that is so even if the two offences can be regarded as part of a single episode of criminality: R v Cahayadi [2007] NSWCCA 1 at [27]; Nguyen v R [2007] NSWCCA 14 at [12]; R v XX [2009] NSWCCA 115 at [52]. 
     
      
    39 In R v Janceski there were two victims of the one occasion of dangerous driving. It was held that the sentences should be partially cumulative in order to acknowledge the harm occasioned to each of the victims. That is the present case also; each of Ms Minzevska and Ms Lei suffered serious injury, and there were separate offences of dangerous driving causing the separate injuries.  
     
      
    40 It was submitted on behalf of the respondent that the judge retained a discretion, and that making the sentences wholly concurrent was within his discretion.  It may be accepted that there was a discretion, and one with the exercise of which this Court will not lightly interfere, see for example R v Hammoud [2000] NSWCCA 540; (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 at [7]; R v Carr [2002] NSWCCA 434; (2002) 135 A Crim R 171 at [32]. But as was said in R v Price [2004] NSWCCA 186 at [49] (Simpson and Howie JJ, RS Hulme J relevantly agreeing) -  
     
      
       
        
        “It will rarely be the case that sentences for multiple offences of dangerous driving causing death could be made wholly concurrent. Because, as was noted earlier, the criminality in the offence is not simply derived from the culpable act of driving without having regard to the consequences, the fact that more than one person is killed means that the criminality will not usually be sufficiently comprehended by a sentence that is appropriate for a single offence. In the present case, even assuming that a sentence of two years was appropriate for one offence, it could not, in my opinion, be an adequate reflection of the fact that the consequences of the respondent’s driving was the death of two persons. This is notwithstanding the statements in  
        R v Hammoud  
        (2000) 118 A Crim R 66 to the effect that a judge has a discretion as to whether to make sentences cumulative or concurrent and legal minds might differ as to what order was appropriate in a particular case.” 
        
       
      
    41 This is applicable also to the present case of significant injury suffered by the two victims. A proper basis for exercising the discretion as the judge did, notwithstanding that complete concurrency would not reflect the harm occasioned to each of Ms Minzevska and Ms Lei, must be seen. It was not enough that their injuries were suffered “during the course of one act”. Nor was it relevant that their injuries were similar.  
     
      
    42 The reasons the judge gave for concurrency were not a proper basis for it. He did not address the need to compound the criminalities from the separate grievous bodily harm. In my opinion, there was error in principle in failing to consider whether the complete concurrency properly reflected the total criminality, and in making the sentences concurrent. 
     
      
    Grounds 2 and 3: General Deterrence, Objective Seriousness, Subjective Features and Manifest Inadequacy 
     
      
    43 These grounds were argued together, and it is convenient to deal with them together. 
     
      
    44 The Crown’s submissions focused on R v Whyte. It was said, in summary, that the present case fell generally within the typical case identified in the guideline judgment; that the respondent’s moral culpability was high and together with other factors at least the suggested range for the typical case was applicable; and that nothing in the respondent’s subjective features warranted the significant departure from the range. It was said, as well, that there was double counting in that the subjective features of youth, depression and prospects of rehabilitation appeared to have been relied on in not imposing a full-time custodial sentence, and also in finding special circumstances so as to reduce the statutory ratio of the non-parole period to the head sentence.  
     
      
    45 R v Whyte identified a typical case of an offence of dangerous driving causing death or bodily harm contrary to s 52A of the Crimes Act. The case was one of a young offender of good character with no or limited prior convictions, where there was death or permanent injury to one person who was a stranger to the offender and no or limited injury to the offender or his or her intimates, and where there was genuine remorse and a plea of guilty of limited utilitarian value: at [204]. For such a case, a custodial sentence would usually be appropriate unless the offender had a low level of moral culpability, as in the case of momentary inattention or misjudgement: at [214]. Where the offender’s moral culpability was high, a full time custodial head sentence of less than 2 years in the case of grievous bodily harm would not generally be appropriate; where there was a lower level of moral culpability, a lower sentence would be appropriate: at [229]-[230]. 
     
      
    46 The respondent’s case was close to the typical case, with variations warranting a higher sentence and a lower sentence but overall indicating a higher sentence. His early plea was of greater than limited utilitarian value; but on the other hand, the very many persons exposed to risk of injury contributed to the seriousness of the offending (see Application of the Attorney-General (No. 3 of 2002) [2004] NSWCCA 303; (2004) 61 NSWLR 305 at [108]; TG v R [2010] NSWCCA 28 at [28]) and he had a very bad traffic record. The judge’s finding of high moral culpability was well justified: the respondent was intoxicated, was driving with complete irresponsibility, and was doing so only two days after a further suspension of his licence for significant speeding had ended.  
     
      
    47 The judge did remark that general deterrence loomed large, and one of his reasons for a sentence of imprisonment being warranted was “questions of general deterrence”. It is not easy to see a finding as to objective seriousness in the remarks on sentence, save in what was said about moral culpability and the objective seriousness warranting a sentence of imprisonment (albeit one which was then ordered to be served by periodic detention). It is not particularly clear how the judge took account of the respondent’s subjective circumstances, although he plainly gave weight to absence of a criminal history (as distinct from the driving record), to remorse, to contrition, to the character references and good character, to unlikelihood of repetition and to the diagnosis of a chronic depressive illness.  
     
      
    48 In my opinion, notwithstanding the respondent’s favourable subjective features, sentences to be served by periodic detention cannot be reconciled with the guidance provided by R v Whyte. 
     
      
    49 The judge was at pains to say that a guideline judgment leaves a judicial discretion. However, a judicial discretion is one to be exercised in a principled way, relevantly in accordance with the guidance of the guideline judgment. As was said by Wood CJ at CL in R v Romanic [2000] NSWCCA 524 at [16], Dunford and Carruthers JJ agreeing - 
     
      
       
        
        [16] While guideline judgments are not to be treated as absolute directions for sentencing Judges, the rationale for their delivery lies in the objective of ensuring consistency in sentencing, and in the opportunity which they provide for a considered analysis by the Court of Criminal Appeal of sentencing principle, in respect of offences where some uncertainty or unevenness in sentencing practice has emerged. They are, accordingly, to be regarded as persuasive, and as a considered expression by this Court as to the proper range of sentences, from which there should be no departure save in accordance with a reasonable and justifiable exercise of discretion –  
        Griggs  
        [2000] NSWCCA 33 at paragraphs 29-30, per Simpson J,  
        Henry  
        (1999) NSWCCA 111 at paragraph 29.  
        
       
      
    50 Nowhere did his Honour address the typical case in R v Whyte, or the guidance provided by that judgment, beyond the unhelpful references such as taking it into account or being mindful of it. It is apparent from the remarks on sentence, in my view, that there was a failure to engage with the proper exercise of the discretion.  
     
      
    51 Moreover, there is just no explanation of why, having said that the objective seriousness of the offence warranted a sentence of imprisonment, the judge decided that the sentence should be served by way of periodic detention. The pre-sentence report gave qualified approval to eligibility and suitability, but that does not mean a decision that there should be periodic detention. If the reason was to be found in Mr Diment’s report, that was not explained, and I do not think it was to be found.  
     
      
    52 Although the Crown did not take the point, arguably the judge further erred in that he did not first decide the appropriate term of imprisonment and then consider whether it should be served by an alternative to full-time detention: R v Jurisic (1998) 45 NSWLR 209 at 215, 249; R v Zamagias [2002] NSWCCA 17 at [24]-[30]; R v Carruthers [2008] NSWCCA 59 at [19]; TG v R at [25]. It is not necessary to take this further. 
     
      
    53 In my opinion, the judge failed to appreciate that a principled basis for the exercise of his discretion required a full time custodial sentence. When there is added that there were two offences and some accumulation was required, the error in sentencing is all the greater. There may have been double counting as to depression: it is hard to tell. It is not necessary to explore double counting. 54 The respondent acknowledged that “there was a degree of leniency inherent in the sentence of periodic detention in the circumstances of the case”. His submissions were to the effect that R v Whyte was a guide but left a discretion; that there was a significant subjective case and in particular (although the judge did not articulate how he took it into account) the diagnosis of depressive illness; and that the judge did take the guideline into account and the sentence “should be regarded as a proper exercise of the broad sentencing discretion allowed to judges at first instance” (emphasis in original).  
     
      
    55 For the reasons I have given, I do not accept these submissions. There was error in principle, and the sentences were manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
       
      Crown Appeals 
       
      
    56 The respondent submitted that appeals against sentence by the Crown should be rare, and only to correct error in principle or definite departure from the available range of sentence. He referred, amongst other cases, to Dinsdale v The Queen [2000] HCA 54; (2000) 202 CLR 321; R v Baker [2000] NSWCCA 85; Markarian v The Queen (2005) 228 CLR 357; and R v MD [2005] NSWCCA 342; (2005) 156 A Crim R 372. In my opinion, this case falls well within the principles upon which a Crown appeal against sentence can be upheld. 
     
      
    57 The respondent further submitted that, if the sentence imposed by the judge had not been open to him, the Crown appeal should be dismissed in the exercise of this Court’s discretion. He submitted also that any sentence imposed on resentencing should be less than that which should have been imposed by the sentencing court.  
     
      
    58 The principles relevant to Crown appeals, of which these were part (see the summary in R v MD at [18] taken from R v Wall [2002] NSWCCA 42, but see also R v AA [2006] NSWCCA 55 at [4]-[20]) are now subject to s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. It provides that in a prosecution appeal against sentence a court must not dismiss the appeal, or impose a less severe sentence than the court would otherwise consider appropriate, “because of any element of double jeopardy involved in the respondent being sentenced again”. 
     
      
    59 Section 68A removes from consideration the distress and anxiety which a respondent suffers from being exposed to the risk of a more severe sentence. The Court’s discretion otherwise remains. But the sentence imposed on resentencing can not be reduced, on the ground of the distress and anxiety, from that which the Court believes is otherwise appropriate: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 39 at [141], [205], [209].  
     
      
       
      Resentencing 
       
      
    60 The respondent submitted that he had served periodic detention from the commencing date of 4 December 2009 (the first day of detention was Saturday 5 December 2009), and that full time custody would curtail his university studies. He submitted that for those reasons the discretion should be exercised in his favour.  
     
      
    61 Interference with the respondent’s studies is a necessary consequence of imposition of a proper sentence, and is not in this case a reason to refrain from imposing a proper sentence. The periodic detention served is taken into account in resentencing. In my opinion, there is no occasion to dismiss the appeal in the exercise of the discretion. 
     
      
    62 Apart from the service of periodic detention, no evidence of changed circumstances was put before the Court by the respondent. 
     
      
    63 The appropriate sentence in the circumstances described in these reasons was in my view a full time custodial sentence for each offence of a non-parole period of 14 months and a further term of 1 year, with the sentences accumulated by 6 months. The finding of special circumstances was not challenged, and should remain. I do not think that lesser sentences would properly reflect the objective seriousness of the offences notwithstanding the respondent’s subjective circumstances.  
     
      
    64 The periodic detention of about 5 months served to date must be taken into account. It is not a case of adding up the days served: while periodic detention is less harsh than full-time custody (see for example R v Hallocoglu (1992) 29 NSWLR 67 at 73; R v Rivkin [2004] NSWCCA 7; (2004) 59 NSWLR 284 at [434]), it involves loss of liberty in a manner disruptive of ordinary life and is “a substantial punishment” (R v Burnett (1996) 85 A Crim R 76 at 96, but going on to compare “the quality of detention” with full-time custody). The periodic detention can be taken into account by an evaluative reduction of the sentence otherwise appropriate, as was done in cases such as R v Pangallo (CCA, 13 August 1991, unreported), R v Hallocoglu and R v McVittie [2002) NSWCCA 344. 
     
      
    65 In R v Hersi [2010] NSWCCA 57 leniency was afforded on resentencing because of delay, due to the pending appeals in R v JW and another case in which the effect of s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act was to be considered, in having the Crown appeals decided. The hearing of the Crown appeals had originally been listed for 30 October 2009, but had been adjourned. The back-dating of the sentence of one of the appellants gave him the benefit of the full period during which he had served periodic detention.  
     
      
    66 The appeal in the present case was heard on the listed date of 2 March 2010, without prior delay. Directions were given whereby further submissions could be made following delivery of judgment in R v JW and the other case. The judgments were delivered on 22 March and 1 April 2010. No untoward delay was occasioned in giving judgment in the present case. I do not think there is occasion for like leniency. 
     
      
    67 I take the periodic detention into account by reducing the first of the sentences to be served by 3 months. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
       
      
    68 I propose the orders - 
     
      
       
      (1) Appeal allowed. 
       
       
      (2) Set aside the sentences of imprisonment to be served by way of periodic detention imposed by Robison DCJ. 
       
       
      (3) Sentence the respondent – 
       
       
        For the offence involving grievous bodily harm to Ms Minzevska, to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 14 months commencing on 3 May 2010 with a balance of term of 1 year.  
       
       
        For the offence involving grievous bodily harm to Ms Lei, to imprisonment for a non-parole period of 11 months commencing on 3 November 2010 with a balance of term of 1 year. 
       
       
      The respondent will be eligible for release to parole on 2 October 2011. 
       
      
    69 Robison DCJ convicted and fined the respondent for driving with the mid-range prescribed concentration of alcohol, and made orders for disqualification from driving. These were not the subject of appeal. For avoidance of doubt, it should be said that they remain.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The applicant was sentenced in the District Court for a number of offences relating to child pornography and child sexual assault. He had pleaded guilty in the Local Court and was committed for sentence. He was before the District Court for six offences and asked that offences on two Form 1’s be taken into account. Garling DCJ (the Judge) sentenced the applicant to a total prison term of 24 years with an overall non-parole period of 18 years. 
     
      
    3 There is one ground of appeal that asserts that the “aggregate head sentence and the aggregate non-parole period are manifestly excessive”. 
     
      
    4 The offences for which the applicant was sentenced are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Count 1 Transmitting child pornography contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(iii) of the  
        Criminal Code 
         (Cth) – maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years. 
         
         
        Count 2 Accessing child pornography contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(i) of the  
        Criminal Code 
         (Cth) – maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years. 
         
         
        Count 3 Possess child pornography contrary to s 91H(3) of the  
        Crimes Act  
        (NSW) - maximum penalty: imprisonment for 5 years. 
         
         
        Count 4 Persistent abuse of a child contrary to s 66EA(1) of the  
        Crimes Act  
        (NSW) - maximum penalty: imprisonment for 25 years. 
         
         
        Count 5 Use child for pornographic purposes s 91G(1)(a) of the  
        Crimes Act  
        (NSW) - maximum penalty: imprisonment for 14 years. 
         
         
        Count 6 Transmitting child pornography contrary to s 474.19(1)(a)(iii) of the  
        Criminal Code 
         (Cth) – maximum penalty: imprisonment for 10 years. 
         
        
       
      The first Form 1 was taken into account on count 6 and contained two offences of transmitting child pornography. The second Form 1 was taken into account on count 5 and contained 4 counts of using a child for pornographic purpose. 
       
      
    5 The sentences imposed were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Count 1 Non-parole period of 3 years with a total term of 4 years from 5 December 2007 
         
         
        Count 2 Non-parole period of 3 years with a total term of 4 years from 5 December 2007 
         
         
        Count 3 Non-parole period of 2 years with a total term of 3 years from 5 December 2007 
         
         
        Count 4 Non-parole period of 12 years with a total term of 16 years from 5 December 2007 
         
         
        Count 6 Non-parole period of 4 years with a total term of 6 years from 5 December 2019 
         
         
        Count 5 Non-parole period of 2 years with a total term of 8 years from 5 December 2023 
        
       
      
    6 Charge 4 referred to a period between 18 November 2004 and 20 October 2007 and alleged that there were 12 separate occasions on separate dates that the applicant had sexual intercourse with the complainant who was then under the age of 10. It also alleged that between those dates there were 36 separate occasions on separate dates that the applicant had committed acts of indecency with the complainant she being then under the age of 16. All of the other offences occurred at dates between February 2005 and December 2007. 
     
      
    7 The facts were agreed and can be briefly summarised. Investigations of the applicant’s conduct commenced in November 2007 and involved the police taking custody of computer equipment from the premises in which the applicant lived. They interviewed the complainant who was the daughter of the applicant’s former partner. She related to them a history of sexual activity in which she engaged with the applicant. 
     
      
    8 Police found over 2,000 images of the complainant, who was aged between 7 and 9 years when the photographs were taken, being subjected to various acts of intercourse, dressed inappropriately or in various stages of undress, using a vibrator and exposing her genitals and anus. There was also a video showing the complainant being subject to fellatio. The applicant had transmitted some of these images to persons overseas and engaged in communications via “chat rooms” discussing child pornography and exchanging images. 
     
      
    9 The applicant had in excess of 729,000 child pornographic images including children of a young age engaging in sexual activity with males and a video of a child engaged in sexual acts with a dog. The applicant had 2,700 video files depicting child pornography. 
     
      
    10 The applicant met the complainant’s mother in 1998 and they lived together in a relationship at Port Macquarie and then in Queensland for six or seven months. They returned to Port Macquarie but then lived separately while maintaining the relationship. The applicant described the child as his “best friend” and said that he felt unwanted by her mother. There was a victim impact statement from the complainant’s mother as to the effect of the abuse upon the child’s well being. 
     
      
    11 The Judge found that counts 3, 4, 5 and 6 fell into the worst category of offences of their kind. He had viewed the material in count 3 and described it as “revolting”. He said that taking into account the nature of the images and videos and their “very large number” that the offence “falls into the top of the range”. He expressed the view that a maximum penalty of 5 years was inadequate to punish the conduct. 
     
      
    12 In respect of count 4, the Judge noted that the offence began when the child was aged 7 and extended over a period of 3 years. The sexual assaults on the child continued whether she was asleep or awake. It involved intercourse with the child’s mouth, her vagina and anus. The applicant photographed and videoed his activity. The Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        It is one thing to look at a still photograph but watching what he was doing to this child on video brings home the horror of what was happening to her. 
        
       
      
    13 The applicant had the complainant perform indecent acts while wearing black fishnet stockings and using a dildo. The Judge remarked: 
     
      
       
        
         
        He took photos and videos of the child while he was abusing her, he dressed her in clothes for pornographic purposes. There was absolutely no reason other than for his sexual gratification. He took away this child’s right to enjoy the life of a child, free from harm and abuse. He was in a relationship with her mother and there was no doubt that the child totally trusted him. The number of incidents of sexual abuse, the fact that they occurred over about three years and the very nature of the sexual abuse placed this in the most serious category. 
        
       
      
    14 The Judge found that for counts 4, 5, and 6 there was significant planning in relation to buying the child clothes, obtaining sex toys and the taking of the photographs. 
     
      
    15 In relation to count 5 his Honour noted that the period of the offence was between February and May 2005 during which the applicant used the child on nine separate occasions for the purpose of photographing and videoing her in erotic postures including exposing herself, holding his penis, shaving herself and wearing inappropriate clothing. The child was aged 7 at the time and was, as his Honour found, vulnerable. The Judge described the photographs as “disgusting and degrading”. 
     
      
    16 Count 6 took place between April and May 2005 while the child was aged 7. The relevant Form 1 matters occurred in April 2005 and May 2007. The applicant took indecent photographs of the complainant and included the child holding written messages to persons to whom the images were to be sent. The images were transmitted to five persons living in Japan, the United States and Ireland. The Judge described the images as “disgusting” and noted that they had been transmitted overseas and could be used in child pornography sites on the Internet. The Judge stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        This charge is not just simply transmitting child pornography, it is transmitting child pornography of a 7 year old girl known to the prisoner and whose mother he is in a relationship with. This is not an anonymous photograph which would be bad enough, this is exposing this young girl to the child pornography industry. For these reasons which include the age of the child, the relationship and those other matters I have set out, in my opinion, rank it in the worst category of this type of offence. 
         
        
       
      
    17 The applicant was aged 44 years and had no previous convictions. He had numerous relationships that failed. He has strong family ties and there was before the Judge a letter from his mother and sister that stated he was a person of extreme kindness and generosity but was naïve, gullible and trusting. He gave evidence describing how he came to have an obsession with child pornography that led to his taking the photographs of the child as it “gave me some credibility with other parties and the level of communication escalated”. He gave evidence as to the nature of his imprisonment on protection, including the absence of educational facilities. But he indicated that he was aware that there were gaols that catered for persons who had committed similar crimes. 
     
      
    18 There was a psychological report prepared within Correctional Services and requested by the District Court. The applicant has little in his background of relevance. It was noted that although the applicant accepted responsibility for the conduct, he continued to blame the child and minimised his involvement in the preparation of the pornographic images. He considered the child as his stepdaughter. He demonstrated poor awareness regarding issues of consent or the impact of his behaviour on the child. He demonstrated a degree of “sexual preoccupation” and would access the Internet sometimes for the whole day. He minimised the degree of planning involved in the offending and the impact upon the child, stating that, if he had not been arrested, he would have had a father-daughter relationship with her. He was prepared to be involved in sex offender programs when they became available to him. 
     
      
    19 There was a pre-sentence report that noted the “low level of victim empathy demonstrated”. 
     
      
    20 The applicant submitted to this Court that the sentence was outside the range available to his Honour. The written submissions contain the following: 
     
      
       
        
         
        …………..In short, such a sentence may well have been appropriate if the applicant had pleaded guilty to murdering the victim. The aggregate sentence is out of proportion to the criminality of the applicant. 
        
       
      
    21 It was not submitted that any particular sentence was too severe but the complaint is about the structure of the sentences. In particular, the applicant argues that the total accumulation of the non-parole period for counts 4, 5 and 6 was unwarranted. At the hearing, the applicant stressed that the sentence imposed was after a plea of guilty that the Judge believed warranted a discount of 25 per cent. 
     
      
    22 The Crown maintained that, although the sentences were heavy, they were warranted by the severity of the overall criminality of the applicant. It was noted that there had been a change in the community’s attitude to child sex offences in recent times as the long-term impact of such offences on the victims had become recognised: see R v MJR (2002) 54 NSWLR 268 at [57]. Reference was made to what had been said about sentencing for offences under s 66AE in Langbein v R [2008] NSWCCA 38 in which it was stated that the offence is more serious than the individual acts that comprise the offence. The Crown noted that the offence in this case comprised 12 offences that each carried a maximum penalty of 25 years with a standard non-parole period of 15 years. There were also 36 acts of indecency that each carried a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    23 Reference was also made by the Crown to what had been said about the seriousness of the child pornography offences by Simpson J in R v Booth [2009] NSWCCA 89 at [40] to [44] and the need for deterrent sentences.  
     
      
    24 I accept that the offences were of the utmost gravity. The Judge stated that he had never seen offences as serious as these. Of course he had seen the pornographic images and videos. Although the offer was made to have this Court receive the exhibits, it was declined. His Honour’s description of its contents was quite sufficient to reveal the appalling nature of the abuse of this child from the age of 7. I am prepared to act upon his determination that some of the offences were in the worst category. 
     
      
    25 But, in my opinion, it cannot be correct that the criminality, as serious as it was, warranted a total sentence before discount of 32 years. I do not accept the applicant’s argument that the sentence is manifestly excessive having regard to what sentence might have been imposed had the applicant murdered the child. Maximum sentences and standard non-parole periods have been set by Parliament for the most serious child sexual assault offence at a very high level: 25 year maximum and a standard non-parole period of 15 years. It must, therefore, be feasible that an offender who is convicted after trial of a very serious offence of that kind could receive a harsher sentence than a person who plead guilty to a mid range offence of murder. Even if such a result might be seen as being unpalatable or even illogical, it could arise from the current sentencing regimes for the two offences.  
     
      
    26 The result in this case depends upon a proper application of the totality principle. The fact that the applicant committed a number of offences that fall within the worst category does not mean that he must receive a sentence that will reflect the criminality of each of those offences if viewed in isolation. The totality principle works to limit punishment to an overall assessment of the offender’s criminality in its entirety and to recognise that sometimes appropriate punishment for each offence can result in a sentence that is unduly harsh or crushing. 
     
      
    27 As bad as the offending was, it was a chapter of the applicant’s life over three years after 41 years of a crime-free existence within the community. The applicant clearly became obsessed with the child, with pornography and with the Internet. It was one course of criminal conduct that seems to have reached the stage where the applicant was unable to control himself. This is not stated in order to minimise his behaviour. It should be denounced in the way that his Honour did and the sentence must be a very severe one. But the conduct must be seen from the perspective of a lack of any suggestion of this type of behaviour until he came into contact with the complainant. 
     
      
    28 I accept that his Honour paid more than mere lip service to the totality principle, in that he made the sentences for the first three offences concurrent with each other and with count 4. But I believe he erred in making the sentences for the last three offences cumulative on one another. It is difficult to understand how his Honour applied the discount for the plea of guilty. For example, the sentence for the s 66EA(1) offence of 16 years does not on its face indicate that a 25 per cent discount has been applied. Nor does the sentence for count 5 that was 8 years. But in any event, as I have indicated, a starting overall sentence of 32 years before the application of the discount is in my opinion manifestly excessive. 
     
      
    29 On the prospect that the Court might re-sentence the applicant, he filed an affidavit as to his current custodial situation. He is on a strict form of protection known as “limited association”. He is confined to his cell for 22 hours per day and has little work or education opportunities. Although there was some evidence before the Judge as to the applicant’s conditions of imprisonment, his custody appears now more onerous than it was at the time of sentence. This is a matter to be taken into account. 
     
      
    30 I would grant leave to appeal and allow the appeal in part. I believe that the appropriate starting sentence before discount is 24 years so that the overall sentence should be 18 years. The non-parole period should be 14 years even though this is a higher percentage of the total term than would result from the application of the statutory ratio. It still leaves the applicant ample time on parole and is the least time he should serve in custody. I have reduced the sentence on count 5 for the purpose of applying the totality principle and found special circumstances in order to achieve the appropriate overall non-parole period. Considered by itself the sentence would be inadequate. 
     
      
    31 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. Grant the applicant leave to appeal and allow the appeal in part. 
         
         
        2. Confirm the sentences imposed for counts 1, 2, 3 and 4. 
         
         
        3. Quash the sentences for counts 5 and 6. 
         
         
        4. In lieu the applicant is sentenced: 
         
         
          
          Count 6: A sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 4 years with a balance of term of 2 years to commence on 5 December 2015 and to expire on 4 December 2019. 
          
         
         
          
          Count 5 A sentence of imprisonment with a non-parole period of 2 years with a balance of term of 4 years to commence on 5 December 2019 and to expire on 4 December 2021, the date upon which the applicant is eligible for release to parole.

      2009/9020 - REGINA v ANTHONY PETER GOOD 
       
       
       
      REMARKS ON SENTENCE 
       
      
    1 HIS HONOUR:  Anthony Peter Good (the offender) was indicted on a charge that he murdered Mario Banovic (the deceased) at St Clair on 7 June 2008. He was acquitted by a jury of that charge but convicted of the alternative charge of manslaughter, the maximum penalty for which is imprisonment for 25 years. There is no standard non-parole period which is applicable to this offence. It is my obligation to sentence the offender, in accordance with well-established principles, for the offence of which he has been convicted. 
     
      
    2 A considerable number of witnesses, including the offender, gave evidence during the course of the trial. Nevertheless, subject to one matter to which I shall refer in due course, the factual background to the offence was not the subject of any significant dispute. 
     
      
    3 The offender and the deceased were well-known to one another. The fatal incident occurred at the 21st birthday party of Erhan Kurtulmus, who was friendly with both of them. It occurred during the course of a fight in which the offender stabbed the deceased a number of times with a knife.  
     
      
    4 The uncontested evidence from Dr Langlois, who performed the post-mortem, was that the deceased sustained six stab wounds in all. Dr Langlois gave evidence that one of the stab wounds to the deceased’s abdomen, which proved to be the fatal injury, penetrated his colon and then his aorta causing the deceased to have a cardiac arrest. An ambulance arrived shortly after the incident and immediately transported the deceased to hospital where he underwent emergency surgery. Tragically however the deceased never recovered consciousness and he died a few days later. Dr Langlois and Dr Serena, who worked in the intensive care unit at Nepean Hospital where the deceased was treated, each expressed the opinion that the deceased died from the trauma occasioned to his organs which was the direct consequence of the stab wounds that were inflicted upon him. That said, it was Dr Langlois’ opinion that none of the other five stab wounds, one of which was to his abdomen and the remaining four to his back, could have been fatal. He described each of them as falling into the mild category of force. 
     
      
    5 Although the deceased was slightly younger than the offender, it appears that they had become acquainted through mutual friends who had all grown up together in the St Clair area. It seems that from time to time they attended the same social functions as part of a larger group, some members of which had attended high school together. The community at St Clair itself appears to have been fairly close knit. From about the middle of 2006 until October 2007 the offender and the deceased’s younger sister, Marina Banovic, were in an intimate relationship. Ms Banovic terminated the relationship with the offender when she discovered that he had also, at least for some of that period, been having a relationship with another young woman named Hannah Ball. That relationship had ended earlier in 2007. In a somewhat ironic twist, it emerged that Hannah Ball had, for some time prior to the fatal incident, been going out with the deceased. 
     
      
    6 After a break of about six weeks, the relationship between the offender and Ms Banovic resumed. Although at no stage did she inform her parents about the existence of the relationship, it would appear that at least prior to October 2007 it was common knowledge amongst the group of young people with whom they mixed that they were a couple. However, when the relationship recommenced it operated in a much more clandestine fashion. The evidence suggests that the offender and Ms Banovic were then much more circumspect about where and when they met. It seems that they also took precautions to avoid being seen by members of their extended social network.  
     
      
    7 It would appear that at least until Ms Banovic terminated the relationship in October 2007, the deceased tolerated their relationship and that he and the offender were on cordial terms. At some stage, for reasons that are not entirely clear, things between them changed. Indeed about six months prior to the fatal incident the deceased initiated a fistfight with the offender, which by arrangement had taken place at a local park. It is common ground that the deceased emerged victorious from the fight. During the course of it, the offender was twice knocked to the ground and then kicked in the stomach by the deceased who at 6’3” in height, was at least 5” or 6” taller than the offender. Some time after the fight, Ms Banovic discovered that she was pregnant. She and the offender decided to terminate the pregnancy, a decision which the offender later came to regret. That, as I understand the situation, precipitated an argument between them. In due course Ms Banovic informed the deceased that she had had a termination. That revelation prompted him to contact the offender and to, in effect, warn him in threatening terms not to contact Ms Banovic. Such contact as the offender and the deceased had in the period leading up to the fatal incident appears to have been acrimonious. Meanwhile, the relationship between the offender and Ms Banovic continued in the clandestine fashion to which I earlier referred. They were in almost constant contact and literally bombarded one another with SMS messages, which were often sent and received in the early hours of the morning, as well as with phone calls. There was evidence before the jury, in the form of call charge records, which revealed the number and duration of those calls. The jury also had available to them extracts from some of the SMS messages.  
     
      
    8 The relationship between Ms Banovic and the offender however remained turbulent and emotionally fraught. Ms Davenport SC, who appeared for the offender, described it as being “doomed”. During certain periods there was no contact between them for several days but when contact was resumed it was with apparently renewed enthusiasm. This body of objective evidence would have made it extremely difficult for the jury to have accepted Ms Banovic’s protestations that her sole reason for maintaining contact with the offender was because he used to threaten her or because she wanted to “keep the peace”. 
     
      
    9 The first occasion on which the offender spent the night at Ms Banovic’s home was during the weekend before the fatal incident. He was able to do so because her parents were away in Croatia. She and the offender were then seen together during the evening of the following Monday (2 June) by a friend of the deceased. When the deceased challenged her about that meeting, she lied to him and then endeavoured to maintain the lie the following day. When the deceased discovered the truth of the matter, he sent her a message the next day (3 June) to the effect that if the offender threatened her, he would “fucking smash him”. The following day the offender and Ms Banovic exchanged SMS messages in which Ms Banovic continued to display her concern about the fact that the offender had been in a relationship with Hannah Ball. The evidence revealed that Ms Banovic found it awkward when Ms Ball came to the house to visit the deceased because her presence was a constant reminder of the hurt which the offender’s infidelity had caused her. The strong indication is that the existence of that relationship also added another level of tension to the relationship between the offender and the deceased.  
     
      
    10 Text messages exchanged on 5 June demonstrated that the offender and Ms Banovic also met up that evening. They then had a lengthy phone call in which, according to the offender, Ms Banovic informed him that the deceased was aware that they had again met up with one another. 
     
      
    11 The following day, 6 June, the offender sent Ms Banovic a number of messages in which he suggested that he should stay at her place for the weekend (her parents being still away). Moreover, it would seem clear that he believed, based on what he had been told by Ms Banovic, that the deceased would be away for the weekend at the snow. Indeed, according to the evidence, it was not until the following day that Ms Banovic herself became aware that the deceased intended to first go to the 21st birthday party before travelling to the snow. There was considerable contact between Ms Banovic and the offender during the course of the Friday as to their respective plans for that evening. Not everything that they said to each other reflected favourably upon them. Later that evening they bumped into one another outside a local nightclub. A confrontation ensued, in which they yelled at each other. It is unnecessary to descend to the details as to what may have led to the argument, but it is clear that as a result of it, Ms Banovic was visibly upset. That prompted her to call the deceased who was understandably angered by what he was told. He, in turn, contacted the accused and told him that he was going to “smash his head in”. The offender thereafter endeavoured to speak again to the deceased. The deceased however declined to accept his calls. The offender was clearly frustrated by his inability to provide the deceased with his version of events and to explain how he and Ms Banovic had inadvertently come into contact with one another that evening. 
     
      
    12 In a very real sense, the tension which existed between the offender and the deceased, was the product of miscommunication. As Ms Banovic readily agreed, she only told the deceased of her concerns about the offender when she was upset with him. Moreover, she acknowledged, that she only ever told him “half the story”. She omitted to tell him, for example, that she continued to have frequent contact with the offender and that their relationship remained an intimate one. Given the distorted view which she provided to the deceased of their relationship, it is perfectly understandable that he reacted angrily on each occasion that Ms Banovic complained to him about what the offender had most recently done. Nevertheless, it goes without saying that she bears no responsibility whatsoever for the events which culminated in the tragic death of her brother. 
     
      
    13 I turn now to the events of the evening of 7 June. The evidence revealed that the offender was in a jovial mood whilst he was getting ready for the party and indeed whilst he was on the way there. It also seems clear that the offender only learnt that the deceased was at the party when informed of his presence by the host. It is apparent that he then became subdued. On the other hand it would seem from the evidence given by Ms Banovic, that the deceased knew that the offender would be attending. The deceased arrived at the party before the offender. Shortly after the offender arrived, the deceased approached him and they had a heated discussion. However, none of the witnesses were able to hear what was said because of loud music which was being played in the community hall in which the party was being held. The offender maintained that the deceased again threatened him following which he went out the back of the premises where he spoke briefly to some of his friends who had gathered there. The evidence showed that when he returned to the hall, the deceased told the offender to “come outside”. The deceased was then seen to go to the front of the premises. As he was on his way out there he was observed handing his glasses to a friend, a gesture that was interpreted by those who observed it as indicating that he was preparing for a fight. The offender then proceeded to follow the deceased to a point outside the hall where they then confronted one other. 
     
      
    14 One guest at the party, Rafaelle Rositano, gave evidence that he saw the offender produce a metal object (which he thought was a key) and hold it up as if he was showing it to the deceased. The offender gave evidence that the object was in fact a knife. He maintained that he had got it from the kitchen drawer of the community hall. In any event, he held it up for the deceased to see and told him that he did not wish to engage in a fight. His purpose in holding up the knife, he said, was to dissuade the deceased from starting a fight. Notwithstanding the presentation of the knife, the deceased proceeded to punch the offender in the head region. At post-mortem, Dr Langlois located underlying bruising on the knuckles of the deceased’s left hand. He said that the bruising was consistent with injuries that would be sustained when punching someone and agreed, in cross-examination, that a “fair degree of force” would be required to produce that kind of bruising. The offender reacted to the deceased’s blows by stabbing him, as I have said, on six occasions with the knife. The encounter lasted for only about 10 seconds whereupon the deceased slumped to the ground. Although the offender rather heartlessly told bystanders who were rendering assistance to the deceased to leave him alone, and that “the next one, will be a bullet”, the Crown candidly acknowledged that the offender was not, at that stage, aware of the tragic consequences of his actions. 
     
      
    15 Shortly thereafter, the offender left the party and went to the home of Sally Eivers, who was the girlfriend of his good friend, Gary Elali. She told the jury that although she could not recall the exact words that the accused had said, he indicated that he had stabbed the deceased a number of times with a knife which he had obtained from his mother’s kitchen drawer. The offender in his evidence denied having done so and relied upon evidence given by his mother as support for his account.  
     
      
    16 The offender was arrested two days later as he was on his way to consult a solicitor. In the interim his telephone calls were intercepted, police having obtained a warrant to do so. During one of those calls, the offender told his uncle that: 
     
      
       
        
        “Yeah, I wasn't copping it no more, man, I wasn't copping any shit off anyone anymore. Everyone was, these guys were giving me death threats and thought they were getting away with it all the time. They got me once before, I wasn't letting them get me again."" 
        
       
      
    17 It is clear from what I have already said that there was a conflict in the evidence as to the circumstances in which the offender acquired the knife that he used to stab the deceased. The Crown case on this aspect of the matter, which depended significantly upon the evidence of Ms Eivers, was that he obtained it from his mother’s kitchen drawer and took it with him to the party. Its case was that he did so with the intention of using it should the opportunity arise or should it become necessary to fight the deceased in the event that there was a confrontation between them. I am not disposed to accept, to the requisite standard, that such an inference should be drawn. First, the available evidence indicates as I have said that the offender did not realise until he arrived at the party, that the deceased was going to be in attendance. His belief, I am satisfied, was that the deceased was going to the snow. In those circumstances, there was no reason for him to obtain a knife to take to the party. Secondly, Ms Eivers was not an entirely reliable witness. In the first place she deliberately omitted making any reference to the offender even being at her home on the evening in question when she was first spoken to by police the following day. She also conceded that the events of that evening were frantic as phone calls were constantly made to and by the offender. Moreover, it was not until 18 months later, a period during which Ms Eivers admitted to having been on anti-depressants, that she first told police about what she said she had heard the offender say on the night in question. Furthermore, she conceded that she had heard many contradictory accounts and rumours about the incident from other people in the period before she came forward and provided the police with the account which she gave in court. Thirdly, the evidence concerning the offender’s demeanour prior to his arrival at the party coupled with his mother’s account about there being no knives missing from her drawer when she looked next day, provide a further reason why the scenario contended for by the Crown should not be accepted. 
     
      
    18 Accordingly, I am of the view that there is no reasonable basis for concluding that the offender went to the party, armed with the knife, for the express purpose of using it in a confrontation with the deceased. Indeed, it would be difficult to reconcile such a view of the evidence with the jury’s verdict. That said, I am unable to determine precisely when and how the offender acquired the knife. There was no support from any other witness for his evidence that he obtained it from the kitchen drawer of the premises. Nor does it seem likely, given how quickly events unfolded, that he would have had the necessary time within which to go to the kitchen and search through the drawers in order to find a knife.  
     
      
    19 What the evidence does enable me to conclude however is that once he and the deceased, who clearly demonstrated that he wanted to fight, confronted one another outside the hall the offender produced the knife and showed it to him. That action appears, in all the circumstances, to be consistent with the conduct of a person who was reluctant to engage in a fight. As I have said, the deceased nevertheless proceeded to punch the offender with some degree of force, before the offender retaliated by stabbing him. 
     
      
    20 The alternative verdict of manslaughter was left to the jury on three separate bases. I have little hesitation in accepting that the jury reached its verdict, and that the offender should be sentenced, upon the basis that he was acting in excessive self-defence. I am fortified in that view by Ms Davenport’s acknowledgement that I should proceed in that fashion. That is to say that he personally believed that his conduct in stabbing the deceased was necessary, particularly in light of their history of disputation and the deceased’s aggression towards him on the night in question, in order to defend himself but that his conduct was not a reasonable one in the circumstances as he perceived them. Although the offender may have had good reason to be fearful of what harm the deceased may have been prepared to inflict upon him, nothing it must be said justified his actions in taking his life particularly as the deceased was unarmed at the time. It is common ground that no issue of provocation arose because the offender in giving his evidence did not assert that he had lost his self-control. Nor, given the medical evidence and in particular the number of occasions on which the offender stabbed the deceased, could his conduct be characterised as an “unlawful and dangerous act”. I am satisfied, given the offender’s actions and the other evidence upon which the Crown relied, that in inflicting the wounds, one of which ultimately proved to be fatal, that the offender acted with at least an intention to inflict grievous bodily harm. 
     
      
       
        
       
      
    21 The offender, who was born in January 1986, is now aged 24. He was 22 at the time of the fatal incident. He swore an affidavit for the purposes of these proceedings. It discloses that he is the eldest of three boys and that his parents and younger brothers have never been in trouble with the law and that they are upstanding members of the community. The offender left school at the end of year 11 and has since then been engaged in productive employment. He intends, upon his release, to complete his training at TAFE as a heavy vehicle mechanic. Prior to going into custody the offender played rugby league for a local team having earlier played representative football for Penrith Juniors. This is the offender’s first experience of being in custody and he currently has an ‘A2’ classification. That has restricted his ability to participate in programs within the prison system although he has participated in a Drug and Alcohol program. The offender recognises that as a result of his crime he will not be able to return to live in the St Clair area. His family is apparently already seeking to relocate to another area of Sydney. 
     
      
    22 The offender has a criminal record which commenced in 2003 when he was placed on a bond for a period of 12 months in the Children’s Court in respect of an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In July 2007 in the District Court (on appeal) he received a fully suspended sentence of 16 months, a condition of which was that he be of good behaviour for the period of the sentence, for an offence of assault occasioning actual bodily harm in company. I have been provided with the factual background to that offence. Because he was still on that bond at the time he committed the present offence, the offender was called-up for having breached that bond which was then revoked. On 12 April 2010 in the District Court the original sentence of 16 months imprisonment to commence on that date with a non-parole period of 8 months which will expire on 11 December 2010 was imposed.  
     
      
    23 I have received an affidavit from the offender’s solicitor, Mr Peter Katsoolis, which sets out the chronology of these proceedings. On 29 May 2009 the offender was committed to this court for trial on the charge of murder following a paper committal hearing. Mr Katsoolis states that “prior to this date [he] had engaged in oral conversations” with solicitors from the office of the Director of Public Prosecutions requesting that the Crown give consideration to a plea of manslaughter in full satisfaction of the indictment. Mr Katsoolis states that “on every occasion [he] was advised that it was a plea to murder or nothing”. Mr Katsoolis gave sworn evidence in which he confirmed that his approach had been upon the basis of instructions from the offender who indicated that he would plead guilty to manslaughter if his offer were to be accepted. The offender was arraigned on 10 July 2009 and entered a plea of not guilty to the charge of murder. On 7 August 2009 the offender’s trial was fixed for 1 February 2010. Written representations on behalf of the offender dated 17 November 2009, in which he again offered to plead guilty to manslaughter, were received by the DPP. The offer was rejected on 9 December 2009.  
     
      
    24 I have received a victim impact statement from the deceased’s older sister which was prepared on behalf of the entire family. The feelings which she has so eloquently and poignantly expressed and the grief which she and her family have suffered is entirely understandable. It is quite impossible to adequately summarise that sense of loss in a few sentences and to do so, or to attempt to do so, would detract from the contents of their statement. Clearly no sentence which any court could impose can ever begin to make good that loss. I extend to the family and friends of the deceased my deepest sympathy. The approach of a sentencing judge to statements of this kind is nevertheless now well settled: see R v Previtera (1997) 94 A Crim R 76; R v FD & JD (2006) 160 A Crim R 392; MAH v R [2006] NSWCCA 226. 
     
      
    25 In approaching the task of sentencing the offender, I must have regard to the purposes of sentencing set out in s 3A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 (the Act). I must also pay due regard to the various aggravating and mitigating factors identified in s 21A of the Act which have particular relevance to the case. 
     
      
    26 It is common ground that the fact that the offender used a weapon is a matter of aggravation. Offences of violence involving the use of weapons, such as knives, understandably attract the disapprobation of the courts and the community. In assessing the objective gravity of the offence, I must have due regard to all the circumstances in which the offender took the deceased’s life, including the fact that he stabbed him on no fewer than six occasions and that some insight into his state of mind at the relevant time is apparent from what he said to his uncle in the telephone call to which I referred earlier. At the forefront of the sentencing task is the fact that a human life has been needlessly taken because of the offender’s unlawful and reprehensible conduct. 
     
      
    27 It is also common ground that in assessing the appropriate sentence to be imposed I must also have regard, as an aggravating feature, to the fact that the offender was on conditional liberty at the time that he committed this offence. The offender’s criminal history, whilst not extensive, disentitles him to any leniency particularly as it entails previous offences of violence. That said, I acknowledge that there is nothing in the offender’s criminal history which remotely approaches the seriousness of the present offence.  
     
      
    28 There are a number of matters upon which the offender is entitled to rely which serve to ameliorate the otherwise appropriate penalty. As I have said, the offender offered to plead guilty to manslaughter in the circumstances to which alluded earlier. The law provides that he is entitled to an appropriate discount for having done so notwithstanding the fact that the Crown did not accept that offer: see R v Oinonen [1999] NSWCCA 102; R v Borkowski [2009] NSWCCA 102 [at para 32]. It is common ground, in the circumstances which I have described, that the offer was made at the earliest possible opportunity and that a discount in the order of 25% is thus warranted. The offender is entitled to a further measure of leniency for having expressed, during the course of giving evidence at the trial, his remorse for his actions. I am also disposed to accept the submission that the offender’s conduct in stabbing the deceased did not demonstrate any real measure of premeditation on his part. His actions represented, in essence, a fairly spontaneous reaction to the circumstances in which he found himself. I accept that the confrontation which culminated in the fatal act was precipitated by the deceased and that some of the things which the deceased said to the offender at relevant times were somewhat provocative. I am also prepared to conclude given his youth, his creditable work record and the fact that he has accepted responsibility for his actions, that the offender enjoys reasonably good prospects of rehabilitation. 
     
      
    29 The Crown submitted that: 
     
      
       
        
        [i]n the scale of seriousness of offences of manslaughter those arising from the reduction of the offence from murder by reason of excessive self defence fall at the higher end of seriousness. 
         
        … 
         
        By way of contrast, offences arising by way of provocation involve a loss of self-control explaining the offence and those arising through substantial impairment by abnormality of the mind involve a substantial impairment of understanding of events, of right or wrong of an impaired ability to control one’s actions. Manslaughter by reason of excessive self defence involves willed and intentional actions on the part of the offender making it more serious than those other types of manslaughter. 
        
       
      
    30 I am unable to accept that submission. In R v Borkowski (supra) Howie J, with the concurrence of McClellan CJ at CL and Simpson J, said: 
     
      
       
        
        However it was made clear in  
        R v Isaacs 
         (1997) 41 NSWLR 374 at 381 that there is no hierarchy of manslaughter verdicts in which, for example, a manslaughter arising from provocation is necessarily more serious and worthy of a heavier sentence than a manslaughter arising from an unlawful and dangerous act. This is notwithstanding that provocation manslaughter involves an intention to kill or inflict grievous bodily harm. It is the particular facts of the killing and not the class of manslaughter that determines the seriousness of the offending:  
        R v Dally 
         [2000] NSWCCA 162; 115 A Crim R 582. [at par 49] 
        
       
      
    31 I was referred by Ms Davenport to the decisions of R v Muddle [2004] NSWSC 403; R v Ward [2005] NSWSC 266 and R v Williamson [2008] NSWSC 686. The Crown specifically referred to my decision in R v Boyd [2004] NSWSC 263 in which I sentenced that offender to a non-parole of 4½ years imprisonment with an overall sentence of 7½ years imprisonment. The Crown’s submission was that that reflected a more appropriate sentencing disposition than the decisions upon which Ms Davenport relied. I have also had regard to the rather more extensive analysis of 37 cases of excessive self-defence which appears on the Public Defender’s website. That said, it is apt to recall that in R v Forbes [2005] NSWCCA 377, Spigelman CJ with whom McClellan CJ at CL and Hall J (with additional remarks) agreed, said that: 
     
      
       
        
        As has frequently been stated, manslaughter is almost unique in its protean character as an offence. (See in particular the observations of Gleeson CJ in  
        R v Blacklidge 
         (unreported, Court of Criminal Appeal, 12 December 1995, esp pp2-3.) In its objective gravity it may vary, as has been pointed out, from a joke gone wrong to facts just short of murder ( 
        R v Weinman 
         (1987) 49 SASR 248 at 252;  
        R v Hoerler 
         (2004) 147 A Crim R 520 at [39]). 
        
       
       
        
        It is also relevant to recognise that, although manslaughters can be characterised in different ways, particularly in the various contexts which may reduce what would otherwise be a murder to manslaughter, the degree of variation  
        within  
        any such category is generally also over a wide range. Matters of fact and degree arise in all categories of manslaughter.  
        
       
       
        
        For example where diminished responsibility is relied upon, the extent to which culpability is ‘diminished’ can vary considerably from case to case. Similarly, although it is possible to characterise a number of cases as “child-killing by a parent or carer”, it may never be possible to identify a sentencing pattern or tariff from the whole body of such cases. (See  
        Hoerler 
         supra.) This is not only because the number of cases in a particular category may be too few to establish a pattern or tariff. It is also because, within any such category, the relevant circumstances can vary over a wide range. This is also true in the case of manslaughter by reason of excessive self-defence (see  
        R v Trevenna 
         (2003) 149 A Crim R 505). 
        
       
       
        
        That test established by s418 of the  
        Crimes Act 
         is whether “the conduct is a reasonable response in the circumstances as he or she perceives them”. Such a test must depend on the characteristics and conduct of the deceased and also the nature of the response, in all of the circumstances of the particular case, on the part of the accused. A test of such a wide-ranging character is unlikely to lead to anything in the nature of a sentencing pattern or tariff in which the decisions on one case are of any particular utility for another. [at paras 133 – 136] 
        
       
      
    32 Although I have given due consideration to all that material in the final analysis however, I must exercise my own discretion based upon the various sentencing considerations to which I have referred.  
     
      
    33 It will be necessary, given the sentence which was imposed for the breach of the bond that was attached to the suspended sentence, to consider the manner in which the present sentence should be structured including the date upon which it should commence. In my view, the most appropriate manner in which to do so is to commence the sentence on 9 December 2008 which is 6 months after the offender first went into custody. That approach will ensure that proper regard is paid to that earlier sentence whilst also giving effect to the principle of totality. I am disposed to accept Ms Davenport’s submission that there should be a finding of “special circumstances” because of the manner in which it has been necessary to structure the sentence. Furthermore, I accept that the offender’s path to rehabilitation will be facilitated by an extended period in the community on parole following what will have been his first time in custody. In setting the non-parole period, I have borne in mind the need to fix the minimum period which the offender must spend in custody. 
     
      
       
      Sentence 
       
      
    34 For the manslaughter of Mario Banovic, the offender is sentenced to a non-parole period of 4 years 9 months to commence on 9 December 2008 and to expire on 8 September 2013 with a total sentence of 7 years 9 months imprisonment to expire on 8 September 2016.  
     
      
    35 The effect of the sentence which I have imposed is that the offender will spend a total period of 5 years 3 months in custody before he is eligible for release on parole whilst the overall period of his sentence of imprisonment will be 8 years and 3 months. The offender will be eligible for release on parole on 8 September 2013.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
       
      
    1 HODGSON JA: This is a Crown appeal pursuant to s 5F(3A) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW) in respect of rulings, made by the trial judge on 7 and 12 April and 5 May 2010, to exclude evidence of lawfully intercepted telephone calls and text messages and to confine the use of evidence of other intercepted telephone calls to count one in the indictment against the respondent Anthony Nguyen.  
     
      
    2 The history of this trial is to some extent set out in an earlier judgment of this court given on 31 March 2010. I do not propose to review the circumstances of the trial in any detail, but rather to go directly to the evidence in question, the basis on which it was excluded and the questions raised by this appeal.  
     
      
    3 I should say at once that, in my opinion, error by the primary judge is established in respect of each ruling. There is still the question, however, whether the decision or ruling “eliminates or substantially weakens” the prosecution’s case within s 5F(3A) of the Act.  
     
      
    4 I should say at once also that I take the view that, when there are a number of rulings on evidence which are sought to be challenged together in an application such as this, the court can consider the combined effect of those rulings and is not restricted to considering the effect of each individual ruling. In those circumstances, it seems to me that the appropriate course is first to look at each individual ruling to determine whether there is error, and then to consider whether the cumulative effect of those rulings is to eliminate or substantially weaken the prosecution’s case.  
     
      
    5 The first ruling which is challenged concerns an intercepted telephone call of 10 December 2005, as to which there is evidence that one of the speakers is the alleged head of the conspiratorial syndicate involved in this case and the other speaker is a person identified in the telephone calls as ‘John’. The Crown wishes to use this call to invite the jury to compare the voice of the person identified in the call as ‘John’ with that in many other intercepted calls which the Crown alleges to be that of John Nguyen. The Crown has other evidence that the relevant voice in those other calls is that of John Nguyen, but the two witnesses who give that evidence may well be the subject of significant credit challenge.  
     
      
    6 The primary judge rejected that evidence on the basis that the subject matter of the call was not relevant to the subject matter of the charges against John Nguyen, that the call occurred before the period of the charges, that the call was made on a telephone not linked in any way to the accused and that the name ‘John’ was not such an unusual name that a jury would draw the inference that it must be the accused John Nguyen speaking.  
     
      
    7 In my opinion, the circumstance that a voice that the jury may consider to be the same voice as on other telephone calls is that of a person with the name ‘John’, and also a person acquainted with the alleged head of the conspiratorial syndicate, is a matter of some relevance tending to support the evidence given by the two witnesses.  
     
      
    8 In argument, I gave the example of where an accused is established as driving an identified motor vehicle, say a blue Ford, and there is a blue Ford identified at the crime scene. Even though there would be a large number of blue Fords, the circumstance that a blue Ford is seen at the crime scene would have some relevance to the question of the guilt of the accused. It seems to me that the same reasoning applies in this case.  
     
      
    9 Accordingly, in my view, the ruling on this matter by the trial judge was in error.  
     
      
    10 The first ground of the appeal also concerns a ruling concerning a second intercepted telephone call on 5 June 2006. That call raises very similar considerations and, for the reasons given in relation to the first call, in my opinion the trial judge was in error in relation to that matter also.  
     
      
    11 Ground two of the appeal concerns two intercepted text messages dated 22 May 2006. The Crown alleges that the first text message was sent by a person ‘Phong’, alleged to be involved in the two conspiracies in this case, to John Nguyen. The second message was allegedly sent by John Nguyen in reply to Phong.  
     
      
    12 It appears that there is evidence associating one of the telephones to Phong and the other to John Nguyen. It appears also that there is evidence that the message sent by John Nguyen was sent from Melbourne. The Crown alleges that, on that date, both John Nguyen and Anthony Nguyen were in Melbourne in pursuance of one of the conspiracies, and the Crown contends that the existence of these messages is relevant to establish that contention. The Crown alleges it is relevant in that the message from a telephone associated with John Nguyen actually came from Melbourne, and the content of these messages gives some support to a contention that Anthony Nguyen was in the vicinity of John Nguyen at the time.  
     
      
    13 The trial judge ruled that the messages had very little probative value and the potential prejudice outweighed the very low probative value. In my opinion, the probative value of the evidence is not insubstantial. It is of course possible that the message sent from the phone associated with John Nguyen was sent by some other person who had access to the phone but, in my view, that possibility, which might be considered as fairly remote, does not substantially impact on the probative value of the material.  
     
      
    14 The primary judge did not usefully identify a way in which the evidence might be misused by the jury and, in my view, there is not such a risk of prejudice as would outweigh the probative value.  
     
      
    15 Ground three relates to a number of telephone intercepts tendered against the accused Anthony Nguyen which the primary judge admitted in respect of the conspiracy alleged in count one, but not the conspiracy alleged in count two.  
     
      
    16 The primary judge made this ruling on the basis that Anthony Nguyen was not a party to the calls, that the calls were not capable of establishing that Anthony Nguyen knew that the money he dealt with prior to 12 March 2006, which was the start of the period for the drug conspiracy alleged in count two, was actually derived from or associated with drug activities, and that the calls themselves were not capable of demonstrating that Anthony Nguyen knew that he was later to be transporting drugs.  
     
      
    17 In my view, there is a relationship between the two conspiracies alleged in counts one and two such that the existence and participation of an accused in one of the conspiracies is of some relevance to the existence of and participation of that accused in the other conspiracy. The overall Crown case is that the money conspiracy concerns money which was applied to and/or obtained from the trafficking in drugs. It is true that the time periods of the two conspiracies are not the same, but that does not operate to exclude evidence in relation to events occurring outside the alleged dates of one conspiracy from being relevant to the existence of that conspiracy.  
     
      
    18 In my view, the evidence in question was relevant to the existence of both conspiracies, and the existence of the conspiracies are matters for the Crown to prove, as well as the participation of each of the accused in those conspiracies.  
     
      
    19 In my opinion, the primary judge was in error in ruling that the evidence was admissible only in respect of one count and not the other.  
     
      
    20 Ground four concerns a ruling made on 5 May 2010 excluding the evidence of two telephone calls made on 1 May 2006 and 22 May 2006. It appears that the trial judge rejected this evidence on the basis that it lacked probative value as it was not established by any evidence that an unknown person speaking in the call knew the accused Anthony Nguyen.  
     
      
    21 In my opinion, that ruling was erroneous. In my opinion, the intercepted telephone calls have relevance in establishing the existence of the conspiracy alleged; and although these calls do not of themselves in any way implicate Anthony Nguyen in that conspiracy, the Crown relies on other evidence to so implicate Anthony Nguyen. The existence of the conspiracy is a matter that needs to be established by the Crown, as well as the involvement of Anthony Nguyen, and in my opinion these telephone calls are relevant to that.  
     
      
    22 It has been submitted for both respondents that there is a vast amount of evidence in the case, and that these disputed matters are only small pieces of evidence, and so the threshold required for the bringing of a Crown appeal under s 5F(3A) is not satisfied. As I have said, I take the view that one considers the cumulative effect of the evidence involved in the Crown appeal; and in my view the cumulative effect of the rejection of all these pieces of Crown evidence would substantially weaken the prosecution case.  
     
      
    23 For those reasons, I would propose that the appeal be allowed. I would propose to order that each of the rulings of the trial judge referred to in the notice of appeal in this case be set aside.  
     
      
    24 JOHNSON J: I agree with the reasons of Hodgson JA and the orders proposed by his Honour. I would make these additional comments.  
     
      
    25 The jury before whom the respondents are presently being tried, since 30 March 2010, constitute the fifth jury empanelled for the purpose of the trial of the respondents. This Court is giving judgment in the third successful appeal by the Crown under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 brought this year with respect to the trials of the present respondents concerning admissibility of conversations and messages upon which the Crown seeks to rely.  
     
      
    26 This Court has been informed that the Crown made application in December 2009 for orders that summaries be admitted of evidence under s 50 of the Evidence Act 1995, an order envisaged under s 145 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986.  
     
      
    27 In February 2010, the Crown served a notice and sought directions under s 149E of the Criminal Procedure Act, a provision lying within Division 3 of Part 3 of that Act, a Division introduced in 2009 and entitled ‘Case Management Provisions and other Provisions to Reduce Delays in Proceedings’. Section 149E gives the trial court express powers to ensure efficient management in the conduct of the trial.  
     
      
    28 With respect, it does not appear that the trial proceedings of these respondents have been conducted in such a way that gives full effect to these significant powers to assist the timely disposal of criminal trials. The provisions contained in the Criminal Procedure Act introduced in 2009 and the mechanisms in provisions such as s 50 of the Evidence Act 1995 serve the public interest in the efficient, fair and timely conduct of jury trials. The use of juries in criminal trials in this State is a most important feature of our system, however, it is not an open-ended commodity.  
     
      
    29 In my view, a trial such as this is the very type of case where the case management powers of the trial court ought be used. The rights of the accused respondents to a fair trial may be appropriately protected, whilst at the same time ensuring the efficient management and conduct of the trial. All of this will serve the public interest in the due administration of justice generally and with respect to the trial of these respondents.  
     
      
    30 LATHAM J: I also agree with the orders and with the reasons of the Presiding Judge and the comments expressed by Justice Johnson. It has not been doubted since the decision of this court in Masters (1992) 26 NSWLR 450 and the decision of this court in Chai (1992) 27 NSWLR 153, that what is said or done by co-conspirators does not lose its relevance as circumstantial evidence of the fact of conspiracy and of the nature of it simply because at the time of the statements or acts, the accused was not then a member of the conspiracy.  
     
      
    31 Her Honour seems to have disregarded a long line of authority in ruling that the conversations, the subject of the rulings on 7 and 12 April, were not relevant because they were outside the dates framed by the indictment. In addition, the admissibility of the material in all four of the Crown’s grounds of appeal assumes additional relevance when one takes into account that the evidence of an alleged co-offender, namely Phong, will be subject to a warning under s 165 of the Evidence Act, thus making the evidence of calls involving Phong critical to corroboration in accordance with that warning.  
     
      
    32 For those reasons, I would join in the orders as stated.  
     
      
    33 HODGSON JA: The order of the court is as I previously stated.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL : I agree with Latham J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J : I agree with Latham J. 
     
      
    3 LATHAM J : The appellant challenges his conviction after a trial concluding on 7 March 2007 on two counts of murder, one count of steal property from a dwelling, three counts of attempting to obtain money by deception, and 12 counts of obtaining money by deception. All of the offences arose out of the strangulation of a retired married couple who were well known to the appellant and lived on a rural property near Windsor, NSW. In the days following the murders on 23 September 2005, a number of bank accounts in their names were unlawfully accessed by the offender. 
     
      
    4 It was the appellant’s case at trial that he was not the offender. There was no dispute that the person who had murdered the victims in their home had taken their property and used their bankcards to obtain cash. The only issue was whether the Crown’s circumstantial case satisfied the jury beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was that person.  
     
      
    5 The appellant, who represented himself on the appeal and demonstrated a thorough knowledge of the evidence at trial and the nature of the circumstantial case against him, essentially submits that the trial was unfair and that a miscarriage of justice has occurred, because of perceived inadequacies in the nature and quality of some of the evidence, and the alleged incompetence of his legal representatives. The appellant also maintains that the verdicts of the jury were unreasonable and cannot be supported, having regard to that evidence (ground 6). 
     
      
    6 Leaving to one side the ground of appeal asserting incompetent representation (ground 3), grounds 1, 2, 4, and 5 seek to impugn the sufficiency, accuracy and reliability of the evidence in the Crown case, the trial judge’s decisions to admit a large number of exhibits, and his Honour’s rulings on evidence and directions to the jury. Assuming there was no pertinent failing in the quality of the police investigation or in the presentation of the Crown case at trial, the Crown’s circumstantial case against the appellant was a compelling one and there was no error in the trial judge’s directions to the jury or in the admission of evidence. The appellant’s submissions do not suggest any error on the part of the trial judge, independently of the success of the appellant’s other grounds. 
     
      
       
      The Crown Case at Trial 
       
      
    7 The appellant provided handyman services to Mr and Mrs Hughes in and about their home. He last provided such services to them in about March 2005. 
     
      
    8 The appellant's marriage broke up in early 2005 and was characterised by a bitter financial dispute which continued throughout 2005. The appellant was in receipt of unemployment benefits and he owed a considerable amount of money to various creditors.  
     
      
    9 The appellant determined that he would leave New South Wales and purchase a hotel business in South Australia. He commenced negotiations with a Mr and Mrs Brian Rolfe in relation to the purchase of the Hoyleton Hotel and on 27 June 2005 the Rolfes agreed that the appellant would purchase the lease for the hotel with the intention of buying the freehold over a period of time. A contract was executed in early July 2005 which required a deposit of $10,000. The appellant did not have these funds but he told the Rolfe's that he was going to obtain the money from the sale of a number of horses, which would also assist in financing the overall purchase.  
     
      
    10 An application was made to the South Australian Licensing Board for the transfer of the hotel licence. Mr Jeff Stevens, who was acting for both of the parties, requested the appellant to provide details of the source of finance for the completion of the purchase of the lease. These details were not provided. Originally, the settlement was planned for mid-August 2005 but that settlement date was ultimately set aside and a new settlement date of 31 August 2005 was set. This date also came and went and a further settlement date of 18 November 2005 was agreed upon. 
     
      
    11 Mrs Rolfe spoke to the appellant many times by telephone between July and September 2005. The appellant told her that he was intending to sell his horses and was still keen to proceed with the transaction. On 19 September 2005 Mr Stevens forwarded a notice of termination of the contracts to the appellant. This was an attempt to make the appellant comply with his contractual obligations. The appellant received these notices of termination on or about the 21st of September 2005. There were however further telephone discussions between the appellant and the Rolfes whereupon it was agreed that if he were to pay $10,000 immediately, the contracts would be reinstated. The Rolfes asked the appellant to send the money to Mr Stevens by cheque. The appellant said he would bring it to them in cash.  
     
      
    12 Finally, it was agreed that the appellant would arrive in Hoyleton in South Australia no later than Monday 26 September 2005 with the deposit in cash. If he did not comply with this arrangement the transactions would be terminated once and for all. It was the Crown case that the appellant decided to steal and use the bankcards owned by Mr and Mrs Hughes in order to provide the deposit for the purchase of the hotel lease. 
     
      
    13 According to the Crown case, the appellant left Patricia Ingrey’s home at Bligh Park, where he resided, early on the morning of 23 September 2005. At some time between 11am on 23 September and 11:39am that day, Mr Hughes left his home and went to the Pitt Town post office to retrieve his mail. The jury was asked to infer that, during Mr Hughes’ absence, the appellant spoke to Mrs Hughes and persuaded her to let him into the house. There, he forced her into a cane wicker chair in the master bedroom and used a number of items of clothing to tie her to the chair. These were a ladies fashion scarf, a navy blue tie and the cord to Mr Hughes’ dressing gown. She was tied to the chair at each wrist and ankle. Either then or later that morning, the appellant tied four further ligatures around the neck of Mrs Hughes and strangled her to death. These were two ladies scarves and two tea towels. 
     
      
    14 When Mr Hughes returned from the post office and entered the house he was struck from behind with a blow to the rear of his head. He was taken to a second bedroom in the house and was tied to a cane wicker chair. This bedroom was used as a study. The appellant used two men's ties and the cord to Mrs Hughes’ dressing gown to tie Mr Hughes to the chair. At some stage, Mr Hughes was gagged with a scarf and blindfolded with a tea towel. 
     
      
    15 The appellant obtained the bankcards and the pin numbers from either or both Mr and Mrs Hughes. At some stage, Mr Hughes was also strangled by the use of ligatures around the neck. DNA profiling on six items found at the home were later found to derive from a major contributor with the same DNA profile as the appellant.  
     
      
    16 The DNA profile located on the red and white scarf which had been tied around the neck of Mr Hughes was found to be from two male contributors. The appellant had the same DNA profile as the second contributor, accepting that Mr Hughes was the other major contributor. The location of the DNA found on the scarf was consistent with friction between the hand of the assailant and the scarf material, when the knot was tied. 
     
      
    17 The appellant's DNA profile was also located on both scarfs taken from Mrs Hughes’ neck, the cord used to tie Mr Hughes, the dark blue tie used to tie the ankle of Mr Hughes and a swab from the cane chair in which Mr Hughes was found. The location of the DNA on each of the materials used to tie the victims was consistent with the DNA material having been deposited at a time when the items were tied. 
     
      
    18 The appellant did not seriously dispute at trial that the DNA material found at the crime scene was his, or that it was at least consistent with being his. Rather, the appellant gave evidence that at various times he had been asked to clean out the drawers and cupboards in the house, to shake out clothing and to remove powder and other debris, following domestic painting and sanding in the house. The appellant also gave evidence that he had occasionally brought washing in from the line or hung out washing on the line, including intimate clothing belonging to Mrs Hughes. 
     
      
    19 The appellant also introduced evidence of injuries to both his arms which reduced his strength, thus making it unlikely that he could have restrained and strangled the deceased. He maintained that he was not in any financial difficulty and that he did not proceed with the purchase of the hotel because he was misled about its condition and profitability. During the trial, the appellant gave evidence that he had access to $51,000 in cash on the morning of 27 September 2005. He said that he had sent this money in a trunk to Hoyleton in July 2005. When the trunk was later given to the police and found to be empty, the appellant maintained that the police had taken the cash from the trunk when it was seized in November 2005. 
     
      
    20 The bodies of Mr and Mrs Hughes were not discovered until late in the evening of 29 September 2005 when their son went to the home following a period of time during which family members had tried unsuccessfully to contact them. 
     
      
    21 At about 1:16pm on 23 September 2005, the appellant attempted to withdraw funds from Mr Hughes’ account at the Riverstone National Bank ATM. This attempt and a further attempt to access a cheque account in the name of Mr Hughes at the ANZ bank failed. At about 1:42pm the appellant drove to an ATM located at St George Bank at Rooty Hill. The appellant successfully withdrew $1000 from the account of Mrs Hughes and a few minutes later successfully withdrew a further $1000 from the joint account of Mr and Mrs Hughes, using the same ATM. Expert evidence from Telstra indicated that the appellant’s mobile phone was near to the Riverstone ATM and to the Rooty Hill ATM at the relevant times that day. The appellant maintained at trial that he was at the home of Patricia Ingrey at Bligh Park or at a nearby service station. 
     
      
    22 On 23 September 2005 at about 10:25pm, the appellant went to an ATM at the Windsor ANZ bank and withdrew $200 from Mr Hughes’ account. CCTV footage of the person who used the machine on this occasion and again on 25 September at 5:12am demonstrated certain physical characteristics that were consistent with the appellant, albeit none of the witnesses positively identified the appellant from that film. 
     
      
    23 Further withdrawals from the Hughes’ various bank accounts were made on the 24 September and 26 September 2005. In total, the sum of $12,400 was taken from the various bank accounts. The appellant arrived in Hoyleton in South Australia on the evening of 26 September 2005. Early the next morning, he gave Mrs Rolfe $10,000 in cash in order to reinstate the contracts.24 There were no further withdrawals from the bank accounts of Mr and Mrs Hughes after 4:31am on 26 September 2005. The Crown relied upon this circumstance in order to demonstrate that the appellant knew he would be implicated in the murders if he attempted to use the bankcards en route to, or in South Australia.  
     
      
    25 On 4 November 2005, the appellant wrote to the Office of the Liquor and Gaming Commission, informing them that the supposed source of the funds for the purchase of the Hoyleton Hotel would be provided from the sale of thoroughbred horses. The enclosed documents confirming the sale of three horses, referred to a horse named “Admiral Quest”. The purchaser, at a sum of $60,000, was a Mrs Ann Hoinville of Maroota South. A friend of the appellant, Ms Collins, gave evidence at trial that she was the person described as Ann Hoinville. She had agreed to sign the document at the appellant's request but she did not have any intention of buying a horse from the appellant nor any means to do so. The appellant himself conceded during his evidence that this was a bogus transaction. The appellant remained in Hoyleton until 18 November 2005 when he was arrested by the South Australian police. 
     
      
       
      The Evidence on the Appeal 
       
      
    26 The appellant relied upon a number of affidavits filed in the appeal. They were five affidavits of the appellant dated 20 November 2009, 13 November 2009, 28 October 2009, 17 May 2009 and 6 May 2009, an affidavit of June Ingray dated 17 May 2009, and an affidavit of the appellant’s son, Robert James Johnson, dated 6 April 2009. 
     
      
    27 The material contained within the appellant’s affidavits largely traverses the evidence at trial and seeks to lay the foundation for the appellant’s submissions on the various grounds of appeal. The appellant’s affidavit of 20 November 2009 asserted that there was a last page missing from a number of statements within the brief that was served upon him by Det Sgt Watson in January and March 2006. Detective Watson’s affidavit of 26 November 2009 and his further evidence on the hearing of the appeal established that there were no missing pages, rather the appearance of an extra page was the product of the template used in the production of statements within the Police Service.  
     
      
    28 Paragraphs 2 to 51 of Ms Ingray’s affidavit concern the events the subject of evidence at trial and certain conversations Ms Ingrey claims to have had with various police officers and witnesses before trial. Paragraphs 58 and 59 describe certain “tests” carried out by Ms Ingray after the trial, some of which seek to meet evidence adduced at the trial but which, in any event, were not relevantly unavailable to the appellant so as to qualify as fresh evidence for the purposes of the appeal. Paragraph 52 concerns an alleged conflict between a statement made by the appellant’s solicitor to the appellant, and information given to Ms Ingrey. It falls into the same category, in that the conflict was known to the appellant during the trial. Paragraphs 54, 55 and 57 contain material that was not relevant to any issue in the trial. Paragraphs 53, 56 and 60 contain material that was dealt with at trial, either by way of evidence or by way of rulings by the trial judge resulting in the exclusion of that evidence. The appellant does not maintain that those rulings were wrong at law.  
     
      
    29 Robert Johnson’s affidavit concerns a debt in the sum of $12,000.00 owed to the appellant, arising out of a loan in May 2005. According to the affidavit, the appellant’s son could not repay the debt at the time it was requested and had not repaid the debt prior to the appellant’s arrest. This evidence was available at trial, notwithstanding that it is asserted that the appellant’s solicitor told the appellant’s son that he was not required to give evidence. In any event, the appellant relied upon the evidence of the debt at trial towards proof that he had funds available to him for the purchase of the hotel.  
     
      
    30 In short, none of the affidavits relied upon by the appellant advanced the case that was put on his behalf at trial. 
     
      
    31 Affidavits by the appellant’s counsel and solicitor at trial were the subject of cross examination by the appellant. That evidence is addressed later in these reasons when dealing with ground 3 of the appeal. It should be noted that the appellant abandoned any claim to legal client privilege for the purposes of this ground. 
     
      
       
      The Appellant’s Submissions 
       
      
    32 The appellant’s written submissions consist of 160 close-typed pages, and 108 hand written pages, all of which meticulously address almost every aspect of the evidence in the trial. Before turning to those submissions, it is helpful to attempt to place them in the context of the ultimate conclusion that the appellant maintains the jury ought to have reached, and which he now urges upon this Court. 
     
      
    33 The appellant goes further than simply submitting that the Crown’s circumstantial case was incapable of proving beyond reasonable doubt that he was the offender. The appellant mounts a positive case to the effect that the objective evidence proved that an intruder killed the deceased on either 26 or 27 September 2005, having held the Hughes captive in their home for a number of days. Given that the appellant left the Windsor area on 26 September (after ringing a veterinary practice concerning a suspected injury to “Admiral Quest”) and arrived in South Australia in the evening of that day, it was clear, according to the submissions, that the appellant was not that intruder. 
     
      
    34 In support of the submission that the deceased were killed as late as 26 or 27 September 2005, the appellant relies upon the proposition that Mr and Mrs Hughes left the property on the morning of 23 September, picked up the mail in Pitt Town, then proceeded to Riverstone Electronics (apparently a business frequented by Mr Hughes) where Mrs Hughes attempted to use the ATM at Riverstone and later used the ATM at Rooty Hill. Further, the appellant relies upon food scraps on the boot of the vehicle belonging to Mr and Mrs Hughes that was parked in the driveway on 27 September (noted by a pest exterminator who visited the property on that day) and food scraps in the kitchen, both of which, according to the appellant, are consistent with a meal being consumed after 23 September. Next, the appellant relies upon the evidence of Dr Du Flou to the effect that decomposition of the bodies could have occurred over two days and suggests that various environmental factors were capable of affecting the samples of fly and maggot infestation in the bodies, such that the evidence from the forensic entomologist was consistent with death occurring on or after 26 September. 
     
      
    35 The appellant points to a number of features of the evidence that indicate the presence of an intruder. The appellant submits that the fact that the single bed in bedroom three of the Hughes’ home had been slept in, the evidence of damage to the slide bolt of the main front door, the presence of a cigarette butt in a Dyson vacuum cleaner under the carport, a shoe or boot impression on either side of the lounge chair where the offender sat, an unidentified fingerprint on the driver's seat belt buckle in Mr Hughes’ car, the presence of a lens from a pair of glasses found on the dressing table in bedroom one, the presence of spectacles on a table in the family room, an unidentified fingerprint on an AWA radio also found on the table in the family room, and the presence of three place mats, three bath towels, and a bucket containing dirty water, were all probative of the intruder breaking into the premises, remaining in the home overnight, taking meals with the Hughes, driving the Hughes’ vehicle, killing the couple and then attempting to clean up afterwards. The appellant points to a wound on Mr Hughes’ head, which he maintains is more consistent with a left-handed assailant than with a right-handed assailant. 
     
      
    36 A number of matters are worthy of mention in response to this broad outline. There was no evidence that Mr Hughes visited Riverstone Electronics on 23 September or that Mrs Hughes was unfamiliar with the accounts accessed by the use of ATMs. The evidence of food scraps is equivocal and says nothing about when they were placed there. The evidence of Dr Du Flou and the forensic entomologist was equally consistent with death occurring on 23 September. 
     
      
    37 The evidence at trial established that Mr Hughes, who snored heavily, often slept in the single bed in the third bedroom so as not to disturb Mrs Hughes. The existence of various items and fingerprints that remained unidentified may have suggested the presence in the home of someone other than the Hughes, but could not be probative of when they were placed there. The damage to the front door was in the same category. The appellant’s hypothesis gives rise to the inherently unlikely prospect that the person who broke into the home chose to remain there, eat meals with the couple, and drive their car, all the while risking apprehension if the Hughes telephoned for help or simply left in the middle of the night. It also ignores the evidence of a neighbour who noticed that Mr Hughes’ car did not leave the driveway after 23 September.  
     
      
       
      Ground 1 – Misconduct by the Investigating Police 
       
      
    38 The first three matters raised by the appellant under this ground were of no relevance to the issues in the trial. The first complaint is that the police prepared a misleading and prejudicial statement of facts for the purposes of extraditing the appellant from South Australia, in collusion with a firm of Adelaide solicitors who appeared for the appellant on the extradition application. The second complaint alleges that the police included incorrect and prejudicial information in support of their application for an arrest warrant. The third complaint is that the police colluded with Mrs Rolfe (co-owner of the Hoyleton Hotel) in her attempt to take possession of four oil paintings belonging to the appellant. None of these incidents, assuming the appellant’s account of them can be accepted, have been shown to have any connection with the nature and quality of the evidence presented at trial. 
     
      
    39 The next complaint under this ground is that the officer in charge obtained the co-operation of, and influenced the evidence of, Mr Phillip Burns by giving him possession of the appellant’s utility. The appellant offered Mr Burns the vehicle as security for a loan on 8 September 2005. The existence of the loan and the fact that Mr Burns held the registration papers was not in dispute. Mr Burns’ evidence at trial established that the appellant told him that he (the appellant) was going to Noosa Heads, at a time when the appellant knew he was going to South Australia. There was evidence in the Crown case which established that the appellant had told other acquaintances the same thing. The appellant also acknowledged in his evidence that he had told everyone, except Ms Ingrey and her family, that he was going to northern NSW. There is no basis for assuming that Mr Burns gave false or misleading evidence because the police gave him the vehicle. 
     
      
    40 The appellant next asserts that the officer in charge gave information to Ms Collins about the appellant that was designed to influence her evidence adversely to the appellant. This assertion derives from Ms Ingrey’s affidavit at paragraph 42. It was not in dispute at trial that Ms Collins had initially denied to police that she knew anything about an agreement to buy a horse called “Admiral Quest”, but that she had later admitted her signature was on the document and that she had signed it at the appellant’s request. It was put to, and denied by, Ms Collins that she had purchased a horse, “Karingal Top Cut”, from the appellant in late 2004 for $15,000 and that she and Ms Ingrey exchanged horses. Although her name appeared on an insurance form as the owner of “Karingal Top Cut”, she explained that the appellant told her he needed to put his horses in different names in order to get them insured and she complied with his requests. Given the undisputed evidence regarding “Admiral Quest”, Ms Collins’ evidence on the subject of “Karingal Top Cut” was credible. It is not clear how Ms Collins’ evidence was relevantly influenced, nor is there any admissible evidence that the officer in charge made any of the statements to Ms Collins that the appellant attributes to him. 
     
      
    41 Ms Ingrey’s brother, Mr Kruijer, gave evidence at trial that he saw the appellant at Ms Ingrey’s on 22 September and that the appellant’s trailer was packed for the trip to South Australia. Mr Kruijer left for South Australia on 24 September and arrived there on 27 September. His evidence was inconsequential. The appellant’s allegation that the officer in charge gave untrue, prejudicial information to Mr Kruijer (also derived from Ms Ingrey’s affidavit at paragraph 45), even if substantiated, does not relevantly affect any issue in the trial. 
     
      
    42 The appellant next addresses a matter that was explored on the voir dire but not put before the jury. It concerned the discovery by Ms Johnson, the appellant’s former wife, of a balaclava in a filing cabinet belonging to the appellant. The appellant’s submissions refer to a leather mask that he had purchased and given to Ms Ingrey. Whatever the import of Ms Johnson’s proposed evidence and the possibility that the item described by her was the leather mask, it was not evidence in the trial and could not have had any bearing on the jury’s deliberations. 
     
      
    43 The appellant raises alleged discrepancies between the statement of Ms Johnson and those of the police concerning the provision of the appellant’s mobile phone number to police. Ultimately, the appellant submits that Ms Johnson supplied misleading information to police and that this aspect of her behaviour should have been explored at trial. Similar criticisms are made of a witness, Mr Mott, who also gave information to police. The basis for the appellant’s submissions about these two witnesses is speculative at best. Both witnesses were cross examined at trial and relevant matters of credit, particularly with respect to Ms Johnson, were left for the jury’s consideration.  
     
      
    44 The appellant also claims that certain information could only have been acquired by the police if they were intercepting his phone service in South Australia and that requests by the appellant for all intercept material had been denied. There was no evidence of any intercept material, or any warrant authorising such action. It could not have benefited the appellant at trial to inform the jury that he may have been under surveillance. Disregarding that claim, any conduct or conversation that advanced the appellant’s case could have been related by him in the course of his evidence.  
     
      
    45 Similarly, the appellant maintains that the officer in charge and another police officer improperly influenced the two witnesses who gave evidence of the consistency between the appellant’s physical characteristics and the person depicted on CCTV footage from the ANZ bank at Windsor on 23 and 25 September 2005. There is no admissible evidence that the police officers said anything to these two witnesses concerning the availability of an expert who would be giving evidence for the Crown. No such expert was called on this issue. Neither witness positively identified the appellant from the film, in spite of the appellant’s assertions that the conduct of the police was designed to that end. 
     
      
    46 In summary, the appellant submits that the alleged instances of improper conduct by the police towards certain witnesses supports the conclusion that the police acted corruptly throughout their dealings with other Crown witnesses and that these issues ought to have been explored before the jury. As the foregoing makes clear, there is no satisfactory evidentiary basis for the proposition that the police improperly influenced the evidence of any witness or withheld relevant information. Ground 1 of the appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2 – Alleged Defects in the Crown Case. 
       
      
    47 The submissions under this ground primarily explore a number of circumstances and features of the forensic evidence that were not relied upon by the Crown at trial. These include those matters that are outlined above at [35]. The appellant also relies upon the absence of statements and materials in the brief of evidence that was served upon him, relating to telephone intercepts and surveillance allegedly carried out in South Australia immediately prior to his arrest. That complaint is dealt with at [44] above.  
     
      
    48 The submission that the alleged conversations, if recorded covertly, may have contradicted some Crown witness regarding the death of the horse “Admiral Quest” and provided evidence of the appellant’s possession of $51,000, is misconceived. Assuming the appellant spoke of such things immediately before his arrest, they were nonetheless self-serving statements made two months after the death of the victims. The appellant’s case at trial, that he had funds to purchase the hotel and that he had no reason to kill Mr and Mrs Hughes, was vigorously pursued in cross examination of witnesses and by the appellant’s evidence. As against that, there was a wealth of evidence in the Crown case, much of it uncontradicted by the appellant in his evidence, that the appellant had borrowed various amounts of money in the months leading up to his departure for South Australia and he had spoken to others of his financial plight. 
     
      
    49 I turn to the unexplained features of the crime scene that are said to support the alternative hypothesis advanced by the appellant. Those features are :- 
     
      
      (i) the house brick 
      
     (ii) the shoe impressions (iii) the damaged front door (iv) the cigarette butt in the Dyson vacuum cleaner (v) the position of two cane chairs in the family room (vi) the AWA portable radio on a table in the family room (vii) a pair of glasses on the same table 
     
      
    50 The appellant engages in speculative reasoning about the presence of a house brick, depicted in photographs (included in Exhibit A at trial) taken at the house on 30 September 2005. It is positioned on the floor inside the front door, consistent with its use as a door-stop. It did not assume any prominence in the evidence at trial. However, the appellant theorises that the brick was used by the intruder to inflict a “V” shape injury to Mr Hughes’ head and that the failure by police to conduct forensic tests on the brick represents a serious defect in the Crown case. There was no evidence from which the inference could be drawn that the brick was used as a weapon in the assault on Mr Hughes. 
     
      
    51 The submissions relating to a number of shoe impressions in the home, that were electrostatically lifted by the crime scene officer and discounted as insignificant, are similarly speculative. The impressions were consistent with the boots worn by police officers, a number of whom had walked through the house prior to the arrival of the crime scene personnel. The appellant claims that two impressions adjacent to a chair, found facing the front door, did not conform to police footwear and were thus likely to have been left by the intruder whilst seated in the chair awaiting the arrival of Mr and Mrs Hughes. The failure to investigate this matter is said to represent another defect in the Crown case. 
     
      
    52 The appellant submits that damage to the slide bolt of the front door, which was first observed by police on 19 October 2005, occurred when the intruder forced entry to the premises in the absence of Mr and Mrs Hughes. None of a considerable number of police officers who attended the home late in the evening of 29 September and in the early hours of 30 September, and thereafter, but before 19 October, noticed any damage to the front door. The front door bolt was depicted in an undamaged state in photographs admitted at trial, although the appellant claims that the absence of a close-up shot of the front door bolt supports his submission that the police deliberately concealed that evidence. 
     
      
    53 A cigarette butt found in part of a Dyson vacuum cleaner in the carport was taken for DNA testing. However, the DNA profile could not be matched to any known male. The appellant seeks to link the cigarette butt to the intruder.  
     
      
    54 The glasses on the table in the family room were not seized for forensic examination on the basis that the police concluded they belonged to one of the victims. This was a wholly reasonable assumption. The appellant suggests they belonged to the intruder, but that submission is, once again, purely speculative. The same observations apply to the presence of the portable radio. It is not apparent from the submissions what significance attaches to the two cane chairs. 
     
      
    55 Each item (i) to (vii) was disclosed by the evidence at trial, even though the Crown regarded each of them as irrelevant to its case against the appellant. There were a number of other everyday things in various locations around the home, including a green cigarette lighter, a black sock and a drinking glass, which the appellant seeks to link to the presence of the real offender. The appellant’s submissions contain a great deal of detail, gleaned from the crime scene photographs and plans. Each and every item in every room of the house that was not part of the Crown case against the appellant is seized upon in order to demonstrate that proof of the charges against the appellant was somehow incomplete, and that the failure to investigate every object in the home fell short of prosecutorial standards.  
     
      
    56 The appellant’s submissions under this ground labour under the misapprehension that it was not open to the jury to convict him unless every feature of the crime scene was satisfactorily explained or attributable solely to the appellant. The existence of evidence that did not implicate the appellant does not, however, equate to the existence of evidence that exonerates him.  
     
      
    57 The appellant’s submissions under this ground also devote considerable attention to the DNA evidence. Despite copious references to the evidence of the Crown expert and the method of sampling the DNA from various items, in order to lay the foundation for the submission that the DNA material was contaminated and the chain of possession was unsatisfactory, the appellant does not ultimately depart from the defence case at trial, namely, that his DNA profile on the relevant items was placed there entirely innocently when working around the home.  
     
      
    58 The area of dispute between the Crown expert and the defence expert was essentially confined to the DNA profile identified as the second major contributor on one ligature, the red and white scarf. Even so, the defence expert agreed that he could not exclude the appellant as a contributor. There was no issue at trial that swabs were taken from each chair where the bodies were found bound and gagged. The defence was able to take advantage of the fact that the swabs from the chair where Mrs Hughes was found did not contain the appellant’s DNA profile. In that regard, any challenge to the chain of possession of the samples would have considerably diluted the force of the submissions arising out of that fact. 
     
      
    59 The appellant’s submissions with respect to the fingerprint evidence or lack thereof are in a similar vein to those summarised at [55] above. The evidence, admitted without objection, established that a number of fingerprints were found in the premises and in Mr Hughes’ car that could not be identified, save that they did not belong to either of the victims. The appellant’s counsel at trial relied upon that feature of the evidence to raise the spectre of the presence of a person or persons, other than the appellant. The appellant complains that it was not established whether all the unidentifiable prints originated from one person. That issue was not explored at trial, but even if it had been, it did not improve the defence position. At the end of the day, the only thing that could be said about the unidentified prints was that they did not match any prints held in the national data base. 
     
      
    60 The appellant’s submissions also query the reliability of the expert evidence relating to the rate of decomposition of the bodies in order to suggest that death did not occur until 26 September 2005. Reference to this submission is made at [34] above. The response to this submission is contained within [36] above. The submissions also fail to appreciate that the evidence of the forensic entomologist and from the autopsy report complemented other objective evidence in the trial, namely, that the victims were last seen on 23 September, that they failed to keep an appointment later that day, that the last known telephone conversation with Mr Hughes was before 11am on 23 September and that newspapers dated 21 and 22 September were found in the carport. The first attempted use of the ATM after 1pm on 23 September was also consistent with theft of the bankcard after the death of the victims.  
     
      
    61 The appellant’s complaints about alleged deficiencies in the autopsy report do not identify how, assuming such deficiencies existed, they could have given rise to a miscarriage of justice. The author of the report was ill and unable to attend the trial. No objection was taken to the interpretation of the report through Dr Du Flou. There was nothing controversial about the autopsy, in the sense that it did not assist in identifying the offender. 
     
      
    62 Further submissions are made to the effect that relevant evidence was missing from the trial. Firstly, the appellant maintains that there were a number of emails sent and received by a computer belonging to Mr and Mrs Rolfe at the Hoyleton Hotel that were not the subject of evidence at trial. The relevance of the emails reproduced from the hard drive of the Rolfe’s computer was the history of the communications between the appellant and the Rolfe’s concerning the contract to purchase the hotel. The circumstances surrounding the failed purchase of the hotel were explored in some detail at the trial. A solicitor who later acted for the appellant in respect of the purchase confirmed the appellant’s evidence at trial that the appellant decided on 17 November 2005 not to proceed with the purchase on the basis that the business was not as viable as he had thought.  
     
      
    63 The critical issue from the Crown's perspective was the fact that the appellant was informed prior to 23 September 2005 that the contract would be rescinded if the appellant failed to pay the deposit. That evidence came from a solicitor, who sent a letter of termination on 19 September to two addresses nominated by the appellant. The appellant does not explain how missing emails are capable of affecting the evidence of that solicitor. 
     
      
    64 Secondly, the appellant complains that exhibit book entries were only produced for the exhibits entered at Windsor Police station and that there were a number of other police stations where exhibits were taken. The appellant asserts that a deliberate decision was taken to exclude entries in the exhibit books relating to items sent for forensic examination. That assertion is without an evidentiary basis. The specific exhibits that were forensically examined, but not the subject of evidence at trial, are not identified. 
     
      
    65 Thirdly, the appellant asserts that his mobile phone records for the period 23 to 26 September 2005 are incomplete and inaccurate. He relies upon certain discrepancies between the records produced at trial (Ex MM) and the statement of a Telstra employee that was included in the brief. The discrepancies were explored at trial and were satisfactorily explained. 
     
      
    66 The appellant seeks to challenge the reliability of the CCTV footage from the ANZ bank at Windsor on 23 and 25 September 2005, and the evidence of certain witnesses relating to the images on that film. A related set of submissions seeks to challenge the evidence relating to the location of the appellant's mobile phone at the times corresponding to the use of ATMs between 23 and 26 September 2005. 
     
      
    67 Dealing firstly with the evidence relating to the CCTV footage, the film depicted a male person, wearing the same or similar clothing on each occasion and appearing to hold a cloth or fabric against the left side of his face. On 23 September the person is seen to light a cigarette. The appellant was a smoker and was described in the evidence of Ms Johnson and Mr Mott to walk in a somewhat hunched over fashion, always looking down. These were characteristics that were observable on the CCTV footage. It was a matter for the jury whether the person depicted on film bore relevant similarities to the appellant. 
     
      
    68 The appellant's submissions re-agitate the evidence which was relied upon at trial, namely that the appellant was at Ms Ingray’s home on the morning of 25 September 2005. The Crown's position was that it was more than possible for a vehicle to travel from Bligh Park to Windsor at that hour of the morning. Further, the appellant restates the effect of the evidence of Mr Porter, an expert called by the appellant on the Voir Dire, concerning the poor standard of the image quality on CCTV recordings, the lack of any visible facial detail and the absence of any natural motion. All of these matters were canvassed in cross examination of Ms Johnson and Mr Mott.  
     
      
    69 The trial judge gave very explicit directions to the jury that their evidence was not identification evidence and that identification evidence was potentially unreliable for a number of reasons. In so far as the appellant seeks to rely upon ""new"" evidence that he required reading glasses to negotiate the buttons on an ATM, that evidence is not relevantly fresh. Moreover, the appellant does not state that he had told his legal representatives at trial of any visual impairment and the appellant wore glasses whilst giving evidence. 
     
      
    70 With respect to the ATM transactions on 26 September 2005, the appellant once again restates his evidence at trial, namely that he left Bligh Park for Hoyleton at about 3:30 am on 26 September and that, having regard to the route he took and the various stops along the way, he could not have arrived at Hay at 1 pm if he had left Windsor as late as 4:28 am, being the time at which the ATM was operated by the offender. Submissions based on this evidence were made on the appellant's behalf and were no doubt considered by the jury. 
     
      
    71 The evidence at trial from an employee of Telstra established that an SMS sent by Ms Ingrey at 1:33 pm on 23 September was inconsistent with the recipient of the message, namely the appellant, being in the Bligh Park area. That communication and others from 1:15 pm were consistent with the appellant being at Garfield St Riverstone, the site of the NAB ATM. Later cell sites accessed by the same phone were consistent with the phone travelling to Rooty Hill before 1:42 pm, the time at which a withdrawal of $1000 was effected from Mrs Hughes’ St George account. 
     
      
    72 Essentially, the appellant seeks to rely upon a report from an expert concerning the one SMS at 1:33 pm. The expert concludes that he cannot exclude the possibility that the SMS was received in the vicinity of a garage, south of Bligh Park, where the appellant maintains he had gone to buy petrol. This very confined opinion does not take account of the remainder of the evidence relating to a series of communications received by the appellant’s phone up to 1:42 pm. In any event, a disagreement between two experts with respect to a single communication could not disturb the convictions otherwise regularly obtained. 
     
      
    73 None of the appellant’s complaints concerning the adequacy, accuracy or reliability of the evidence produced at trial are capable of giving rise to any misgivings about the strength of the Crown case. A consistent theme in the appellant’s submissions is that his convictions can only be upheld if the Crown case was completely flawless and that anything less constitutes reasonable doubt. That is not the law. The jury were required to consider all of the circumstances pointing to the appellant’s guilt as a whole. The verdicts, which reflected the force of the combination of those circumstances, are not called into question by the absence of evidence on matters of little consequence to the issues in the trial. This ground of the appeal also fails.Ground 3 : Incompetent Legal Representation. 
     
      
    74 In general terms, the appellant submits that his legal representatives did not devote sufficient time to pre-trial conferences and that they failed to seek an adjournment of the trial. More specifically, the appellant complains of the failure of his legal representatives to adequately explore two specific issues, namely an injury to the appellant’s left arm which is said to cast doubt on the appellant’s ability to restrain the deceased, and the use of gloves in the course of the commission of the offences. The appellant also complains of inadequacies in cross-examination of various witnesses and the failure to issue subpoenas for the attendance of other witnesses on the appellant's instructions. Finally, the appellant claims that his legal representatives failed to capitalise on the presence of a ""red thread"" at the crime scene and evidence concerning the appellant's capacity to pay for the purchase of the Hoyleton Hotel. 
     
      
    75 The complaint with respect to the issue of subpoenas may be briefly dealt with. The appellant's trial was legally aided. The appellant's solicitor sought the approval of the Legal Aid Commission to issue subpoenas as instructed by the appellant but was refused funding for a number of those subpoenas on the basis that the material was not sufficiently probative. The appellant's solicitor informed the appellant of the reasons for that decision. Otherwise, the appellant's solicitor issued 14 subpoenas, variously to witnesses to give evidence and to organisations requesting the production of records, notes, documents and all correspondence. Subpoenas issued on the appellant's instructions to service stations for the production of CCTV footage from relevant dates were not productive. Those businesses were no longer in possession of any relevant film. 
     
      
    76 Contrary to the appellant's assertion that there were four pre-trial conferences with his solicitor, the appellant's solicitor at trial provided evidence of eight pre-trial conferences, at which extensive notes were taken. In addition, there were extensive telephone conferences, numerous shorter telephone conferences and communications with Ms Ingrey, including some 202 typed pages constituting the appellant's instructions. 
     
      
    77 Neither the appellant’s solicitor or counsel recall any instruction to adjourn the trial or any complaints made by the appellant to them about their conduct of the trial. The appellant's solicitor did not, contrary to the appellants claim, apologise to the appellant for not being prepared for trial. The appellant's complaint that he received limited correspondence from his solicitor is explained by the fact that the appellant instructed his solicitor not to forward correspondence to the gaol because the appellant believed that his correspondence was being vetted and supplied to the police. According to the appellant's solicitor, the appellant was informed at every stage of his trial of the progress of the defence and was consulted about the manner in which the defence was to be conducted. 
     
      
    78 The appellant's legal representatives consulted with and briefed a number of experts, including a DNA consultant, a neurophysiologist, an engineer, a forensic scientist, an electrical engineer and a neurologist. Particularly with regard to the injury to the appellant’s left arm, the neurologist was briefed in order to provide an opinion regarding the appellant’s capacity to tie knots and restrain the victims. That expert attended court and was further interviewed by the appellant’s legal team. Both the appellant's solicitor and counsel made the forensic decision not to call the neurologist, given that the neurologist was not prepared to express the view that the appellant could not have undertaken the relevant activity. That decision was communicated to and discussed with the appellant during the conference at trial. 
     
      
    79 The line of enquiry that the appellant now asserts ought to have been pursued at trial concerning the gloves, relates to the evidence of trace DNA, matching the appellant's profile, found on various items within the home. The appellant seems to be asserting that a pair of gloves, given to him by Mr Hughes in November 2000, were left on a table near the laundry when the appellant last worked at the property. The appellant theorises that the offender found the gloves, put them on and committed the offences, thereby leaving the appellant’s trace DNA on ligatures and furniture. The conference between the appellant's solicitor and a DNA expert discounted this scenario as ""highly unlikely"". The forensic decision not to pursue this aspect of the appellant's instructions was entirely appropriate and understandable. 
     
      
    80 A similar false issue is raised by the appellant concerning the alleged presence of a “red thread” at the crime scene and the failure by investigating police to match the thread to any item of clothing belonging to the appellant. Counsel cross-examined the officer in charge to the effect that a ""red thread"" had been found at the crime scene, a suggestion that was denied. The appellant himself gave evidence that the officer in charge referred to a ""red something"" in the course of arresting the appellant. Ultimately, counsel submitted to the jury that, upon the appellant’s arrest, police took possession of two jackets, one of which ""had red on it"", from among a number of jackets. It was suggested rhetorically that the appellant's evidence, that he had heard the officer in charge say ""Take those two. We want to match the red"", was consistent with that selective choice. There was no evidence that a red thread was found at the crime scene and no suggestion in the Crown case that such an item existed. The appellant's legal representatives made as much mileage as was available to them from the state of the evidence. 
     
      
    81 The appellant maintains that his legal representatives failed to cross-examine Michael Hughes, the deceased’ son, with respect to a debt of $506 owed by him to his employer. The debt was incurred some three years before the murders. The proposed object of the cross examination appears to be to suggest that Michael Hughes had a motive to kill his parents for financial gain. The appellant's solicitor refers to a conference with the appellant and his counsel on 18 January 2007, at which time the decision was taken by the appellant not to pursue that line of enquiry. 
     
      
    82 The remaining specific complaint is a failure by the appellant's counsel to further cross-examine the appellant's former wife and Ms Collins and to call the appellant's son on the subject of the availability of funds for the purchase of the hotel. Both the appellant's former wife and Ms Collins were cross-examined on relevant issues. Persistent and aggressive cross-examination carried the risk of disclosing other prejudicial evidence of the appellant's dealings with these witnesses. The appellant's solicitor was specifically instructed by the appellant not to call his son and it was never suggested to him that the appellant's son was in a position to provide finance for the purchase of the hotel. 
     
      
    83 Accused persons are generally bound by the manner in which counsel conduct trial proceedings. Counsel have a wide discretion, consistent with the independent role of the barrister, and that wide discretion will not be disregarded by an appellate court, regardless of whether forensic decisions are made by counsel without instructions, or involve errors of judgment or even negligence. Objectively, there was no ""flagrant incompetence"" of counsel or any material irregularity in the conduct of the trial by the appellant's legal representatives that would give rise to a miscarriage of justice : see R v Birks (1990) 19 NSWLR 677 ; Steve v R [2008] NSWCCA 231. 
     
      
    84 This ground of the appeal fails. 
     
      
       
      Grounds 4, 5 and 6 – Error in Admitting Evidence and Exhibits, Error in Directions, Verdicts Unsupported by the Evidence. 
       
      
    85 The appellant makes no further submissions in support of these grounds. Their success is entirely dependent upon the success of grounds 1, 2 and 3 combined. Having regard to the conclusions I have reached on those grounds, I would not uphold the remaining grounds of the appeal. 
     
      
    86 The order I propose is that the appeal be dismissed.

    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: The applicant pleaded guilty to one offence of sexual intercourse of a child under 10 years of age contrary to s 66A of the Crimes Act 1900. The maximum penalty for the offence is 25 years imprisonment. There is a standard non-parole period of 15 years.  
     
      
    2 The applicant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment consisting of a non-parole period of 8 years 3 months and 13 days (commencing 13 June 2008) with a parole period of 4 years 5 months and 15 days. The non-parole period is 65% of the total term. 
     
      
    3 The applicant was also sentenced for an offence of contravening an apprehended violence order contrary to s 14(1) of the Crimes (Domestic and Personal Violence) Act 2007. The offence carries a maximum term of imprisonment of 2 years. The sentencing judge imposed a fixed term of 2 months imprisonment which was made wholly concurrent with the principal sentence. 
     
      
    4 The facts of the matter were agreed before the sentencing judge. The applicant was at home with his four children the complainant AO aged 6 years, KO 4 years, ALO 3 years and EO aged 1 year. The applicant’s wife, who is the mother of each of the children, was out shopping. The complainant had been asleep on the lounge in the living room. The applicant went and sat on the lounge next to the complainant and started to kiss her on the lips, cheek, neck and shoulder area. The applicant told the complainant to go to her room and having closed the door to the room told her to undress.  
     
      
    5 The complainant was then instructed to lie on the bed with her “bum” in the air. The applicant removed his clothes, stood behind AO and inserted his penis into her anus and moved it backward and forward for some period. He then removed his penis and AO saw him ejaculate into his hand. The applicant left the bedroom to have a shower and AO dressed and returned to watch television. 
     
      
    6 The next day upon AO’s mother observing a rash on AO’s bottom the latter complained about the assault saying inter alia, “Dad put his bum in my bum. I was screaming and crying because it hurt. He spit on my bum and after he finished milk came out of his bum.” The applicant’s wife confronted him about the complaint. The applicant made denials and threatened her if the matter was taken up with the authorities. On the same day the complainant was interviewed by the Parramatta Joint Investigation Response team. She told an officer that when the offence occurred “it felt like a sharpened sword and I was crying and crying, I told him to stop.” An apprehended violence order was issued on 13 June 2008 which was breached by the applicant on 17 June 2008. He was arrested on 18 June 2008 and has remained in custody ever since. 
     
      
       
      Subjective matters 
       
      
    7 The applicant was aged 33 at the time of the offence. He had been in a relationship with AO’s mother for 8 years and was the father of their four children. He worked as a carpenter having migrated to Australia from Lebanon in 2001. The applicant had no criminal antecedents and was otherwise of good character. 
     
      
    8 The applicant did not give evidence. However, there was material before the sentencing judge which established that the applicant had been considered by his sister-in-law, prior to the offence, to have been “an excellent husband and an excellent father.” The probation report indicated that since the offence the applicant had been alienated from his wife and children as well as other family members. 
     
      
       
      The appeal 
       
      
    9 There are four grounds of appeal advanced by the applicant. I am not persuaded that any of them justifies the intervention of this Court. It must be remembered that the offence carries a maximum penalty of 25 years imprisonment. Of particular significance in this case is the standard non-parole period of 15 years.  
     
      
    10 It was agreed before the sentencing judge by counsel for the applicant that the applicant had committed a mid-range offence. The consequence would be that allowing, as his Honour did for the maximum discount for the guilty plea but leaving aside any other matters the appropriate non-parole period was of the order of 11 years. This must be compared with the non-parole period which his Honour imposed which was 8 years 3 months and 13 days. Although the applicant was a person of prior good character and his Honour found that he has good prospects of rehabilitation (which was not challenged by the Crown in this appeal) and allowing for the fact that the offence was spontaneous or opportunistic and the applicant has shown remorse, the sentence which his Honour imposed was in my opinion clearly within the appropriate range. 
     
      
    11 The first ground of appeal is concerned with his Honour’s characterisation of the offence as being “at least” in the mid-range of objective seriousness. His Honour recorded the concession made by counsel for the applicant that the offence fell within the mid-range but elsewhere in his remarks on sentence said that the offence “is correctly placed in my opinion by both counsel at least in the mid-range of objective seriousness.” It was submitted that this statement was not entirely correct, the suggestion being that counsel for the appellant did not accept that the offence may have fallen above the mid-range. 
     
      
    12 The relevant portions of his Honour’s remarks are firstly: 
     
      
       
        
        “This of course is a very serious offence. The Crown has characterised it in the mid-range of objective seriousness. Mr Stewart (for the prisoner) said he could not resile from that and indeed I find that this conduct of this crime is in the mid-range of seriousness.” 
        
       
      
    13 Later he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “As I said, I have found this (offence) is at least in the middle range of objective seriousness.” 
        
       
      
    14 This Court has previously indicated that a finding expressed as to the objective seriousness of an offence in general terms, without a clear statement as to the level of objective seriousness of the offence is not satisfactory. The statement which his Honour made could suggest that he had concluded that the offence fell above the mid-range but has not identified the extent to which this was the case. When an ambiguous expression is used by a sentencing judge it does not enable the offender or this Court to understand the sentencing judge’s conclusion as to the seriousness of the offence which is fundamental to the sentence which was ultimately imposed. In R v Knight, R v Biuvanua [2007] NSWCCA 283 Howie J, with whom both Hidden J and myself agreed, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The judge described the objective seriousness of the offence committed by Ms Knight as ‘at least in the mid-range of objective seriousness’. The Crown on this appeal conceded that ‘her Honour correctly assessed the objective seriousness of the offending.’ With respect to both the judge and the Crown Prosecutor, it is impossible to understand how such an assessment fulfils the obligation on a trial judge in applying the standard non-parole provisions to assess the objective seriousness of the offence committed. Presumably the judge thought that the offence was somewhere above midrange but believed that she did not have to assess the exact level of seriousness because it was sufficient that she found it was ‘at least mid-range.’ But with respect, if that is how her Honour approached the matter, she was clearly in error. Although such an assessment cannot made with absolute precision, it must at least indicate whether the offence is assessed as below, of, or above midrange of seriousness with some indication as to the degree to which it departs from the midrange if that is the finding.” 
        
       
      
    15 See also R v Mitchell, R v Gallagher [2007] NSWCCA 296 and Rawlings v R [2006] NSWCCA 84. 
     
      
    16 Although his Honour’s remarks are ambiguous I do not believe this has occasioned any error in the sentence which was imposed. If his Honour had determined to sentence the applicant for an offence falling above the mid-range a greater penalty than that which he imposed would have been appropriate. 
     
      
    17 The second ground of appeal argues that the sentencing judge wrongly confined himself to the consideration of the plea of guilty as the only reason to depart from the standard non-parole period.  
     
      
    18 The applicant is correct in emphasising that his Honour only expressly identified the plea of guilty as a reason for departing from the standard non-parole period. However, if his Honour had in fact confined his consideration to the guilty plea, as I have indicated, a non-parole period of the order of 11 years would have been the result. The non-parole period which his Honour imposed was significantly less than 11 years and accordingly it is apparent that his Honour, although not expressly indicating that he had taken this course, did have regard to other matters when determining the appropriate sentence. 
     
      
    19 It is important for this Court to again emphasise that it is necessary for sentencing judges to take care in identifying the matters which have been of significance when arriving at the sentence imposed on an offender. Only if this is done will it be possible to understand the judge’s reasons for arriving at the sentence and enable effective review by this Court. The obligation to give reasons is fundamental to the judicial process. 
     
      
    20 In support of the third ground of appeal the applicant submitted that his Honour had had regard to irrelevant and/or inaccurate material. In particular complaint was made about the fact that his Honour said when determining the appropriate penalty: 
     
      
       
        
        “One would have to infer that there is no one who wants to speak on his behalf because the crime is found to be so despicable.” 
        
       
      
    21 It was submitted that this was not an accurate statement because there was evidence before the sentencing judge that his sister-in-law had reported to the officer who had prepared the pre-sentencing report that prior to his arrest the applicant appeared to be “an excellent husband and an excellent father.” Although the sister-in-law made this comment there is every reason to accept that since the offence had become known the applicant has been ostracised by his family and the community. This was only to be expected and the finding which his Honour made was in my view appropriate. It was not at odds with the sister-in-law’s statement. 
     
      
    22 The final ground of appeal was the general submission that the sentence was manifestly excessive. As I have already made plain in my view this submission cannot be sustained. The applicant drew attention to some previous decisions where offenders have been sentenced for a breach of the same statutory provision. However, two of the cases involved fellatio and the offences were of quite significantly different character (RJA v R [2008] NSWCCA 137; Eedens v R [2009] NSWCCA 254). The applicant also referred to two cases involving penile penetration of the vagina of a young girl (RJA v R [2008] NSWCCA 137; MLP v R [2006] NSWCCA 271) where sentences comparable to that imposed on the applicant were imposed. 
     
      
    23 The offence which the applicant committed involved a gross breach of trust. It is true that the offence was spontaneous and involved a single event. However, the complainant who was only 6 years of age, was told to strip naked and was penetrated when screaming and crying and imploring the applicant not to continue. The age of the applicant was significant confirming her particular vulnerability: see R v Pearson [2005] NSWCCA 116 at [33]-[35]; MLP v R (2006) 164 A Crim R 93 at [22] and R v PGM (2008) 187 A Crim R 152 at [36]-[38]. The offence in the present case was of a degrading nature being one of anal intercourse: R v Russell (unreported, NSWCCA, 21 June 1996). 
     
      
    24 In my judgment the sentence imposed on the applicant was within the sentencing judge’s discretion and no error has been identified. Even if I had found an error I am satisfied that no lesser sentence was warranted in law. 
     
      
    25 Although I would grant leave to appeal the appeal should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: This is an application for leave to appeal against sentences imposed in the District Court. The applicant was sentenced by Nield DCJ (the Judge) on 17 December 2008 for three counts of take and drive a conveyance without the consent of the owner (“take and drive”) contrary to s 154A(1)(a) of the Crimes Act. There were also before the court two related matters of drive manner dangerous to the public (“dangerous driving”) and drive whilst disqualified, both being dealt with pursuant to s166 of the Criminal Procedure Act. In addition the applicant asked the Judge to take into account in relation to the third count of take and drive a charge of receiving on a Form 1. The maximum penalty for the offence of take and drive is imprisonment for 5 years. The maximum penalty for dangerous driving is imprisonment for 12 months and for drive whilst disqualified 2 years. 
     
      
    3 The sentences imposed were as follows: 
     
      
       
       1. Count 1: For the take and drive committed on 8 June 2007, a term of imprisonment of 1 year 10 months and 15 days to commence on 20 March 2008 and expire on 3 February 2010 with a non-parole period of 1 year 3 months to expire on 19 June 2009.  
        
       2. Count 2: For the take and drive committed between 25 and 26 May 2008, a term of imprisonment of 2 years 3 months to commence on 20 June 2009 and expire on 19 September 2011, with a non-parole period of 18 months to expire 19 December 2010. 
        
       3 Count 3: For the take and drive committed between 25 and 27 May 2008, and taking into account the Form 1, a term of imprisonment of 3 years to commence on 20 September 2011 and expire on 19 September 2014, with a non-parole period of 9 months to expire on 19 June 2012. 
        
       4 Charge 4: For the offence of drive in a manner dangerous committed on 27 May 2008 a term of imprisonment of 9 months to commence on 20 September 2010 and expire on 19 June 2011, with a non-parole period of 6 months to expire on 19 March 2011. 
        
       5 Charge 5: For the offence of driving whilst disqualified committed on 27 May 2008, a term of imprisonment of 1 year and 6 months to commence on 20 September 2010 and expire on 19 March 2012, with a non-parole period of 12 months to expire 19 September 2011. 
       
       
      The effective total sentence was 6 years and 6 months, with a total non-parole period of 4 years and 3 months. He is eligible for release to parole on 20 June 2012. 
       
      
    4 The grounds of appeal filed on behalf of the applicant were:  
     
      
       
        
         
          
         
        1. His Honour erred in determining a sentence based on the characterisation of Counts (sic) 4 and 5 as “worst class,” and to the exclusion of relevant mitigating features. 
         
          
         
        2. His Honour erred in failing to take into account the Applicant’s mental illness and disorder. 
         
          
         
        3. His Honour erred in failing to correctly apply the principle of totality.  
        
       
      
     
     
      
       
        
        Facts 
        
       
      
    5 The facts for each count are as follows.  
     
      
      Count 1 
      
    6 At about 5.30pm on 8 June 2007 the applicant took a motor vehicle, a Holden Camira without the owner’s consent. The vehicle taken was involved in a collision with another motor vehicle and the applicant abandoned it. Police later located the vehicle in the middle of Woy Woy Road with extensive front-end damage. There were three passengers trapped in the other vehicle who were later conveyed to hospital with chest and shoulder pain. Police interviewed the applicant on 30 May 2008, during which the applicant denied any involvement. 
     
      
       
      Form 1 – receiving 
      
    7 Between 5.15pm on 20 June 2007 and 8.35am on 21 June, the applicant and three young persons attended a real estate agency. The young persons entered the premises and carried out a Canon printer, fax machine and a large amount of keys. They discarded the property on a vacant block directly next door to the premises. Approximately one week later the applicant and one of the young persons returned to the vacant block and collected the Canon printer. They both returned the printer to the applicant’s residence. About 6.30pm on 19 July 2007 Anti Theft police attended the applicant’s address and asked him about the matter. He said he didn’t know anything about the break-in but did purchase a Canon printer off “two kids”, suspecting that it was stolen. 
     
      
       
      Count 2 
      
    8 Between 9.00pm on 25 May and 7.30am on 26 May 2008 the applicant took a motor vehicle, a Mazda Sedan, without the owner’s consent. At about 1.45am on 27 May 2008 highway patrol police saw this vehicle on the Central Coast Highway at Kariong. The vehicle had two occupants at the time. Police lost sight of the vehicle before it could be stopped. 
     
      
       
      Counts 3, 4 and 5 
      
    9 At about 9.00pm on 25 May 2008 the owner of a Ford Courier Utility parked his vehicle in a vacant block at the intersection of Wisemans Ferry Road and the Pacific Highway, Somersby. The vehicle was secured and left unattended. Between this time and 2.00am on 27 May 2008 the offender took the motor vehicle without the owner’s consent.  
     
      
    10 The vehicle was observed being driven in the following circumstances. At about 2.00am on 27 May 2008 Anti Theft Police sighted the vehicle being driven by a single male driver, later identified as the applicant. Police commenced pursuit of the vehicle, activating all warning lights and sirens. Police noticed that the vehicle was being driven in a “convoy”, following a second vehicle, a white Ford Courier Utility. Both vehicles failed to make any attempt to stop for police. They appeared to have little regard for the road rules, or the safety of the public or police.  
     
      
    11 The first of the vehicles eventually turned into the car park of a nursing home where it was driven towards a large fence surrounding the car park. As police pulled up alongside the stolen vehicle, it collided with the front passenger side of a police vehicle. Police were able to exit via the driver’s side of the vehicle and arrest the offender, a juvenile. Upon being arrested the young person stated to police that the applicant was driving the other white utility. 
     
      
    12 Police then engaged in a second pursuit with the vehicle driven by the applicant. He was pursued through Umina Beach and onto Empire Bay Drive, where his vehicle reached speeds of about 150kph in the marked 70kph zone. Several times the applicant crossed to the incorrect side of the road and cut corners. At one point the applicant braked heavily on a left hand bend and attempted to reverse into a police vehicle, causing police to cross to the incorrect side of the road to avoid a collision.  
     
      
    13 The pursuit continued with the applicant’s vehicle reaching speeds of 120kph in a 60kph zone, then 100kph in a 50kph zone and 100kph in a 70kmph zone. The applicant evaded road spikes by crossing onto the incorrect side of the road. He approached night road works with traffic diversions in place. Police terminated the pursuit and the applicant continued through the road works at high speed causing workers to jump for cover behind railings and road plant. The applicant used both sides of the road and drove through newly paved bitumen. Police re-engaged pursuit after clearing the road works and noticed the applicant again crossing onto the incorrect side of the road when negotiating corners. The applicant continued at speeds double and occasionally more than double the speed limit. The offender again avoided road spikes. 
     
      
    14 The applicant turned left near the Ocean Beach SLSC car park and drove down a lane way against the correct traffic flow and entered Umina Beach SLSC car park where he travelled through it at speeds of 90kph. He travelled down an un-named access road towards a ‘skate park’. He then drove through a narrow opening onto a Recreation Reserve and continued driving. In order to do this the applicant squeezed between two metal barriers, causing considerable damage to the vehicle and the barriers. At this point the pursuit was terminated to avoid damage to the police vehicle.  
     
      
    15 The applicant was at all times a disqualified driver and is disqualified from driving until 30 January 2024. He was later arrested and initially denied any involvement in the car chase.  
     
      
       
        
        The applicant’s subjective case  
        
       
      
    16 The applicant was aged 28 years, being born on 9 April 1981. He has a bad traffic record as well as a substantial criminal record dating from 1996. According to the Judge’s sentencing remarks, the applicant has been dealt with for 54 offences including 37 in the Children’s Court, 11 in the Local Court and 6 in the District Court. In addition he has had 13 offences taken into account when sentenced in the District Court. He has been dealt with for 18 offences of take and drive motor vehicles across all jurisdictions. He has been dealt with in a court for 28 traffic offences of which 3 were for driving without a licence, 16 for driving whilst disqualified, 1 for driving in a manner dangerous and 2 for driving at a speed dangerous. 
     
      
    17 The applicant has served numerous terms of imprisonment. The Judge’s sentencing remarks state that for the 9 years between 31 May 1999 and 30 May 2008 the applicant has been out of custody on 9 occasions, the longest being for a period of 10 months, and the total period at liberty being about 2 years and 9 months. The applicant has twice had parole revoked. He was on bail when he committed the last three offences. 
     
      
    18 There are only two significant subjective matters. The first is that the applicant will spend his sentence on protection by reason of the fact that he has previously been sexually assaulted in custody. Although the applicant gave evidence before his Honour that he spent 23 hours of each day in the cells, an affidavit tendered before us indicates that he shares a cell with another inmate and has a job as an Activities Clerk in which position he organizes social activities within the prison. He hosts events and helps to organise variety shows. Presumably, therefore, prison does not present itself in quite the same degree of harshness as it did at the time he was sentenced. 
     
      
    19 The second subjective matter is the applicant’s mental health. As there is a ground relating to this factor, I will consider it later. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 
      
    20 The complaint is that his Honour erred in finding that the offences of dangerous driving and drive while disqualified were in the worst category. In Veen v The Queen (No 2) [1988] HCA 14; (1988) 164 CLR 465 it was stated at 478: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The second subsidiary principle material to this case is that the maximum penalty prescribed for an offence is intended for cases falling within the worst category of cases for which that penalty is prescribed: Ibbs v R (1987) 61 ALJR 525 at 527; 74 ALR 1 at 5. That does not mean that a lesser penalty must be imposed if it be possible to envisage a worse case; ingenuity can always conjure up a case of greater heinousness. A sentence which imposes the maximum penalty offends this principle only if the case is recognisably outside the worst category. 
        
       
      
    21 The argument is that, having regard to the subjective factors relevant to the applicant, including his mental illness and harsh gaol conditions, the offences could not be regarded as being in the worst category. Reliance was placed upon what Badgery-Parker J said in R v Twala (NSWCCA, unreported, 4 November 1994). His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        ………………….The argument that was put to us involved the proposition that because it is possible to envisage, and indeed to find in the court files, cases which are worse than the present case, it necessarily follows that the present case is not one appropriate to the imposition of the maximum sentence. I reject that approach. However, in order to characterise any case as being in the worst case category, it must be possible to point to particular features which are of very great heinousness and it must be possible to postulate the absence of facts mitigating the seriousness of the crime (as distinct from subjective features mitigating the penalty to be imposed)…………… 
        
       
      
    22 That statement was made in considering the offence of murder and the provision that was then found in s 19A of the Crimes Act and now in s 61 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999. There is considerably more scope for a variation in the particular factual circumstances in a crime of murder than there is in either an offence of driving in a manner dangerous or drive whilst disqualified. In the latter offence there are very few factual considerations that might apply when trying to determine the seriousness of a particular offence. 
     
      
    23 Counsel for the applicant suggested that driving immediately after being disqualified by a court might be a more serious case than the present case of drive while disqualified. In respect of the dangerous driving charge she submitted that there was nothing about the facts that brought it within the worst category. She noted that a history of previous convictions could not make the specific offences more serious. While that is true, the applicant’s record would as a matter of aggravation justify a sentence at the top of the range appropriate to the objective seriousness of the offence. A sentence that denounced the applicant’s conduct and acted as a specific deterrent to the applicant was appropriate notwithstanding the applicant’s subjective considerations. 
     
      
    24 If the offences were in the worst category, it does not follow that the maximum penalty ought not to be imposed simply because of the offender’s subjective considerations. As Badgery-Parker J indicated in the passage quoted above, in determining whether the offence is in the worst category no regard is given to subjective mitigating factors. Those factors of course are relevant in deciding whether the maximum penalty should be imposed, having first determined that the offence is in the worst category. Subject to the issue of the applicant’s mental illness, I do not see that his Honour was in error in refusing to mitigate the sentences if he were correct in finding that they were in the worst category. 
     
      
    25 I do not see why a reduction must be given for the harsh conditions of imprisonment to a persistent offender who should be aware that by offending he will be returned to custody and have to spend his imprisonment in harsher conditions. If the threat of return to custody and the harsh prison environment does not deter him from future offending, then the court might be entitled to have regard to preventative detention if the offender presents as a serious enough risk to the community. There is nothing in Veen (No 2) that indicates preventative detention is not an appropriate aim of punishment provided that there is a proper foundation for it and provided that the sentence is not disproportionate to the objective seriousness of the offence in order to achieve that purpose. 
     
      
    26 But in any event I do not believe that the applicant should understand that, whenever and however he offends, he will be entitled to an automatic reduction in any sentence of imprisonment imposed upon him because of the nature of his custody. Eventually the stage must be reached that the court will not take that factor into account as a mitigating factor. The Judge said he took it into account, but that may have been a generous finding in the applicant’s case. 
     
      
    27 In my opinion it was open for his Honour to find that the offence of dangerous driving was in the worst category. The dangerous driving offence had aspects that did bring it in the worst category, including the driving in “convoy” with another vehicle also being driven dangerously, that he engaged in a second course of leading the police in pursuit and that he put members of the public in actual danger in travelling through the road works. There was an absence of facts that mitigated the commission of that offence. Whatever may be the relevance of the applicant’s mental illness, it had no impact upon his culpability for that offence. The applicant simply has not the slightest regard for the traffic rules or the requirement that he be the holder of a valid licence. 
     
      
    28 The offence of drive while disqualified does not lend itself to significant variations in seriousness. It is possible to imagine a case where the driving was a result of some humanitarian consideration, for example, to deliver a person to hospital or was a result of some other emergency. The example given by counsel of contumelious conduct in the face of a court disqualification might give rise to a case in the worst category. However, there was nothing particular about the present case that made the offence more serious than the usual case of disqualified driving once the applicant’s record is disregarded apart from the fact that he was on bail. However, having regard to his record as an aggravating factor, a more severe sentence was warranted than might generally be the case. 
     
      
    29 However, it is the totality of criminality involved in charges 3 to 6 that is important. Subject to the relevance of the applicant’s mental illness, a severe sentence was to be imposed upon the applicant for taking and using a motor vehicle while disqualified from driving and using that vehicle to drive dangerously. The argument that the sentences for charges 4 and 5 were excessive is somewhat technical having regard to the fact that they were ordered to be served concurrently. On general principles I do not understand how the criminality in driving dangerously was not increased by the fact that the driver was disqualified at the time. The Judge should have made the sentences partly cumulative. But in my view an effective sentence of 18 months for those two offences was not excessive as a measure of their objective seriousness. Whether the sentences are excessive having regard to the applicant’s subjective circumstances will be considered later. 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 2  
        
       
      
    30 The complaint is that the Judge failed to take into account the applicant’s mental illness. The applicant was suffering from the following mental disorders: chronic Post Traumatic Stress Disorder arising from past events, including being raped in gaol; depression; anxiety and substance abuse. He was said to have attempted suicide on forty-seven occasions. He is alleged to “self-medicate” by the use of illegal substances. It was asserted that at the time of the offending he had a mistaken belief that he had contracted the HIV virus and this led him to recommence the use of alcohol and illegal drugs. He has been involved in numerous rehabilitation courses including spending 15 weeks at the William Booth Clinic. 
     
      
    31 It is submitted that his Honour erred by failing to have regard to the applicant’s mental condition because he dismissed it as having no causal link to the offending. His Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
         
        The offender enjoys good physical health, albeit that he has suffered a fracture of the wrist, which has left him with reduced movements of the wrist. However he does not enjoy good mental health as revealed by the reports exhibits 1 and 2. He has recently been treated for seizures, see exhibit 3. He has been diagnosed as suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, see exhibits 1 and 2. Although I accept his mental state is unstable, I cannot see any relationship between his state of mental health and his commission of the subject offences.  
        
       
      
    32 It is trite that an offender’s mental illness can be a relevant factor in sentencing notwithstanding that it is unconnected to the offending for which the offender is being sentenced. The fact that the mental condition is unconnected to the offending means that it does not impact upon the offender’s culpability so as to diminish the objective seriousness of the offending. However, it can still be relevant in that it may indicate that the offender is not a suitable case for general deterrence or that gaol will bear more harshly upon the offender because of the mental illness: R v Hemsley [2004] NSWCCA 228. In the present case the applicant’s mental illness did not bear upon his criminal culpability and there was no evidence that it had any bearing on the nature of his imprisonment. 
     
      
    33 However, it is also trite that an offender does not receive a lesser sentence simply because he suffers from a mental illness: R v Engert (1995) 84 A Crim R 67. That is because it may be that the mental illness means that the offender presents a danger to the community or indicates that specific deterrence may be appropriate where, for example, the offender refuses to take appropriate medication. 
     
      
    34 Where the offender acts with knowledge of what he is doing despite the fact that he suffers from a mental illness, it does not follow that the offender is not a suitable vehicle for a deterrent sentence: R v Wright (1997) 93 A Crim R 48 at 51. The fact that the applicant self-medicates with alcohol and drugs does not lessen his culpability for his offending or indicate that general deterrence should not be a highly significant factor. 
     
      
    35 Although his Honour was in error in dismissing the relevance of the applicant’s mental illness simply because it was unconnected with the offending, it does not seem to me that this approach resulted in any significant error in the exercise of his discretion. In light of the applicant’s criminal and traffic record, the nature of the driving and the fact that the applicant clearly understood the criminality of his conduct, there was no error in finding that general deterrence was a relevant factor. Personal deterrence was also a highly significant factor. 
     
      
    36 I would not conclude that the applicant generally presents as a danger to the community, but that simply means it was unnecessary to fashion a sentence that involved protection of the community or preventative detention. There is nothing in the sentencing remarks that indicates his Honour sought to impose a sentence based upon preventative detention. I would reject this ground of appeal. I do not believe the applicant’s mental illness was a factor that warranted any particular leniency being granted to him. 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 3 
        
       
      
    37 The complaint is principally with the sentences imposed for charges 3, 4 and 5 and the fact that the sentence for count 3 (take and use) was made cumulative upon the offences in charges 4 (dangerous driving) and 5 (drive disqualified). I have already indicated that in my opinion there was no justification in making the sentences for charges 4 and 5 totally concurrent. 
     
      
    38 The argument is that, because each of these offences had the common element of “drive”, it was an error in principle and contrary to Pearce v The Queen [1998] HCA 57; (1998) 194 CLR 610 for his Honour to impose a sentence for count 3 that was to be served cumulatively upon the sentence for charges 4 and 5. The following passage from Pearce was relied upon: 
     
      
       
        
         
        [40] To the extent to which two offences of which an offender stands convicted contain common elements, it would be wrong to punish that offender twice for the commission of the elements that are common. No doubt that general principle must yield to any contrary legislative intention, but the punishment to be exacted should reflect what an offender has done; it should not be affected by the way in which the boundaries of particular offences are drawn. Often those boundaries will be drawn in a way that means that offences overlap. To punish an offender twice if conduct falls in that area of overlap would be to punish offenders according to the accidents of legislative history, rather than according to their just deserts. 
        
       
      
    39 Although the three offences in charges 3-5 technically had a common element of driving, they were dealing with different circumstances surrounding the applicant’s driving. The offence of take and use, was concerned with driving a vehicle without the consent of the owner. Charge 4 was concerned with the fact that the applicant was driving while disqualified. Charge 5 was concerned with the manner of driving. The applicant was not being punished three times for driving. In fact there is no offence of “driving a vehicle” and he was not being punished for that activity. The offences were distinct and separate acts of criminality that arose from the fact that he was driving a vehicle. I do not believe that the passage in Pearce quoted above required that the sentences be at least partly concurrent. There was no element of double punishment involved. 
     
      
    40 It was further argued that the offences involved “one course of conduct which gave rise, in effect to only one victim”. With respect I do not understand the submission. There was one victim insofar as the owner of the vehicle was concerned. But that says nothing about whether the offences could, or should, be dealt with by concurrent sentences. In my opinion his Honour was entitled to make what orders he thought were appropriate so far as concurrence or accumulation was concerned provided that at the end of the day the overall sentence was appropriate to the total criminality involved in the three offences. In my opinion there was no error in making the sentence for count 3 cumulative upon the sentences for charges 4 and 5. The only error was that the sentences for charges 4 and 5 were made concurrent. 
     
      
    41 Although there was no separate ground that the sentences imposed were manifestly excessive, I am concerned at one aspect of his Honour’s sentences. There is an increase in the term imposed for each of the take and use offences as well as some accumulation in the sentences. There was no difference between the offences of take and use in terms of their objective seriousness. There are very few variations in the manner in which the offence of take and use can be committed. It will be a relatively rare situation that one example of the offence can be more serious than another. In any event there was nothing in the facts in counts 1 and 2 that indicated that the penalty for count 2 should be higher than for count 1. Nor could the inclusion of the offence of receiving, having regard to the facts of that matter, nor the fact that the applicant was on bail have resulted in a penalty for count 3 that was so much greater than count 1. It is not appropriate in my opinion to increase the penalty for an offence because it is a second offence and then make that offence partly cumulative with the first offence. 
     
      
    42 In the pre-Pearce sentencing regime it was not uncommon for sentences for similar offences to be increased, offence by offence, so that the last offence carried the penalty for all offences because all the sentences were made concurrent. But that is no longer an appropriate way of achieving totality. It is erroneous for sentences for individual offences of the same type to be increased, simply because they happen to be a second or third offence and then for them to be made cumulative upon one another, as his Honour did, because in effect it results in double counting. 
     
      
    43 His Honour imposed a sentence of 22 months 15 days for the first take and drive, 2 years and 3 months for the second and 3 years for the third taking into account the matter on the form 1. As I have indicated I do not understand how the sentences for the three offences could differ except so far as the third charge took into account the receiving and the fact it was committed on bail. But those factors could not justify a sentence of 3 years having regard to the maximum penalty of 5 years and a discount of 25 per cent. 
     
      
    44 In my opinion the overall sentence is manifestly excessive and that is largely due to the increasing sentences for the take and drive offences. His Honour determined that the total sentence should be 6 years 6 months. But that had to be the overall sentence after the application of a 25 per cent discount for the pleas of guilty. It is difficult to determine what the starting sentence was before the application of the discount, a matter that raises some concern about how the sentences were determined. It was somewhere between 8½ years and 9 years. Such a starting point was manifestly excessive in my opinion. 
     
      
    45 It is important to note that, when sentencing for multiple offences, the discount has to apply to the overall sentence imposed and not just the individual sentences. This of course may be difficult when there are different discounts applicable to different sentences. A rigid application of Pearce means that the sentence for each offence, including any applicable discount, is determined and then attention paid to the issue of totality. But in considering totality the sentencer must not lose sight of the discount that has to apply to the total sentence and not just the individual sentences. Where all sentences are made concurrent, of course the problem does not arise. But where individual sentences are accumulated, either in whole or part, the discount can be eroded. 
     
      
    46 In my opinion the appropriate end point is an overall sentence of 6 years reduced by 25 per cent to give a total sentence of 4 years. The sentence takes into account the fact that the applicant’s custody may be somewhat harsher by reason of his protective status. The Judge found special circumstances, with hesitation. I doubt that this decision was justified in light of his findings as to the likelihood of re-offending and lack of motivation to reform. However, I am not prepared to find special circumstances generally as in my opinion the applicant should spend at least 3 years in custody for the offences he committed. A parole period of 12 months is adequate for the applicant to receive some assistance by way of supervision. In coming to this view I have taken into account the applicant’s affidavit filed in this Court. 
     
      
    47 I am imposing fixed terms for all offences except count 3. These sentences are the equivalent of a non-parole period in each case. A fixed term is chosen because of the sentence to be imposed on count 3 that will include a parole period. I have found special circumstances in fixing the non-parole period in count 3 by reason of the accumulation of sentences. The question of cumulation and concurrency has been driven by what is required having regard to totality. The discount for the plea has been taken into account in the over-all sentence imposed rather than the individual sentences. The sentences correspond with the order in which the Judge sentenced the applicant. 
     
      
    48 I propose the following orders: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1. The application for leave to appeal is granted and the appeal is allowed. 
         
         
        2. The sentences imposed in the District Court are quashed. 
         
         
        3. The following sentences are imposed: 
         
         
          
          1. Count 1: A fixed term of 15 months to date from 20 March 2008 and that expired on 19 June 2009. 
          
         
         
          
          2. Count 2: A fixed term of 15 months to date from 20 June 2008 and expired on 19 September 2009. 
          
         
         
          
          3. Drive disqualified: A fixed term of 6 months to date from 20 September 2009 and to expire on 19 March 2010. 
          
         
         
          
          4. Dangerous driving: A fixed term of 6 months to date from 20 January 2010 and to expire on 19 July 2010. 
          
         
         
          
          5. Count 3: A non-parole period of 12 months to commence on 20 March 2010 and to expire on 19 March 2011 with a balance of term of 12 months to commence on 20 March 2011. 
          
         
         
        The applicant is to be released to parole on 20 March 2011. It is to be a condition of his parole that he take any medication prescribed by a medical practitioner for his mental condition in accordance with the direction of the practitioner.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This is a Crown appeal with respect to sentences imposed on the respondent who pleaded guilty to a number of offences concerned with child pornography and sexual intercourse with a person under age. He was sentenced in respect of one offence of using carriage services to access chid pornography in contravention of s 474.19(1)(a) of the Criminal Code 1995 (Cth) for which a maximum penalty of 10 years is provided. He was also sentenced for one offence of possessing child pornography in contravention of s 91H(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 (now repealed), which attracts a maximum penalty of 5 years imprisonment; two offences of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 10 and 14 years in contravention of s 66C(1) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which a maximum penalty of 16 years imprisonment is provided; one offence of aggravated sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 14 and 16 years in contravention of s 66C(4) of the Crimes Act 1900, for which a maximum penalty of 12 years is provided; three offences of sexual intercourse with a child between the ages of 14 and 16 years in contravention of s 66C(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 attracting a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment. 
     
      
    2 He was sentenced as follows: 
     
      
       
        In relation to the first count a term of imprisonment of 1 year and 10 months to date from 10 December 2008 and expire on 9 October 2010, but the respondent to be released on or after 23 August 2009 upon entering into a recognisance of $1,000 to be of good behaviour for the remainder of the term of the sentence. 
       
       
        In relation to count two imprisonment for 1 year and 10 months to date from 10 December 2008 and expiring on 9 October 2010 with a non-parole period of 8 months and 14 days commencing on 10 December 2008 and expiring on 23 August 2009. 
       
       
        In relation to counts 3 to 8 his Honour ordered that the respondent be released on a bond to be of good behaviour for 3 years with a condition of the bond that he attend for counselling as may be directed by the Probation and Parole Service. 
       
      
    3 Although the Crown originally lodged an appeal in relation to the Commonwealth offence, that appeal was subsequently withdrawn. 
     
      
    4 The facts have been conveniently summarised in the appellant’s submissions which I gratefully adopt. 
     
      
    5 In June 2008 the Australian Federal Police Child Protection Operations Team received some information about the sharing of child pornography files on the internet. Investigations revealed that ten of the IP addresses involved were allocated to the respondent. 
     
      
    6 On 10 December 2008 the AFP executed a search warrant on the respondent’s parents’ home where he lived. Various computer files containing child pornography were seized for further forensic examination and “eMule” Peer 2 Peer software was found to be actively downloading child pornography files on the computer located in the respondent’s bedroom. Numerous DVD’s and CD’s containing child pornography were also seized. 
     
      
    7 Subsequently a review of various computer items seized revealed a total of 82,882 image files and 344 multimedia files. Their contents were summarised according to the COPINE Scale. 
     
      
       
        
        COPINE Scale: 
        
       
       
        
        1. Images depicting erotic posing with no sexual activity 
         
        2. Images depicting sexual activity between children, or solo masturbation by a child 
         
        3. Images depicting non-penetrative sexual activity between adult(s) and child(ren) 
         
        4. Images depicting penetrative sexual activity between adult(s) and child(ren)

    8 The respondent admitted to police that he had accessed and downloaded child pornography over a period of six to seven years, using search terms known to police to be commonly used to search for child pornography on the internet. The respondent admitted that he downloaded child pornography to “enjoy” it and that he views child pornography at least once or twice per week. 
     
      
       
      Sexual advances against a child 
       
      
    9 During the search of the respondent’s residence, a journal labelled “Memories Don’t Forget” was located, which clearly indicated that the respondent had been involved in a sexual relationship with a female under the age of 16 years who has been identified by the letter “C”. 
     
      
    10 The respondent admitted to police that the author of the journal was his “ex-girlfriend”, who was then 14 years old. They had recently broken up following a relationship of approximately 16 months. During their relationship, the respondent had sexual intercourse with his “ex-girlfriend” approximately 12 times, the first occasion being when she was 13 years and a few months before her 14th birthday. Of those 12 occasions, one or two occasions involved multiple acts of sexual intercourse and oral sex. On at least one occasion, the respondent supplied his “ex-girlfriend” with alcohol with which they played “drinking games” before proceeding to have sexual intercourse. The respondent had also taken both digital video and still images of his “ex-girlfriend” and himself having sexual intercourse, which he had saved. 
     
      
       
      Subjective matters 
       
      
    11 The respondent was aged 25 years at the time of the sentence. He had no prior convictions. He was raised in a good, hard working family who migrated to Australia from Hong Kong but reports feeling neglected during his childhood. He was bullied at school making him increasingly withdrawn and isolated. He has no alcohol or drug problems and no psychiatric illness. He was in employment and lived with his parents and younger sister. The psychological evidence indicated that the respondent suffered from stunted psychological and psychosexual development and in relation to those matters had a notional age of 15 years. He was remorseful and the sentencing judge found that he was unlikely to reoffend if given ongoing counselling. He has undertaken this counselling at his own instigation. His prospects of rehabilitation have been assessed as good. 
     
      
    12 Ms Solomon, a forensic psychologist with Forensic Psychology Services in the Department of Corrective Services has assessed the respondent as “moderate to low risk category for sexual re-offending.” 
     
      
    13 The respondent is of above average intelligence, achieving a UAI of 83.5 in the Higher School Certificate in 2002. He attended the University of New South Wales for 3 years studying Mechanical Engineering and attained credit averages. However, he discontinued his study in 2006. 
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    14 The sentencing judge discussed the objective factors relevant to the different offences. In relation to the child pornography offences he said: 
     
      
       
        
        “The number of images and multi-media files on the offender’s computer are significant, representing the results of seven years collection. From the analysis carried out by the Federal Police very few represent the worst category of child pornography, those involving bestiality or sadism. But almost all involved individuals who must be assumed not to have the capacity to make informed choices about whether or not they engage in activities which may be degrading, humiliating or painful. In a number of cases, including  
        Gent  
        162 A Crim R 29, courts have pointed out that the reasons why offences involving child pornography are regarded as so serious is that of necessity the creation of the images involves the exploitation of vulnerable people and imposing sentences for such offences general deterrence and a denunciation are important considerations. I wholeheartedly agree. It is well recognised that the courts must send a message to the community not only that those who create child pornography will be punished severely but those who consume it will also be punished, because without them there would be no market incentive for anyone to exploit the vulnerable children. 
        
       
       
        
        I have been referred to a number of cases where offenders have been dealt with for offences involving child pornography, and even if they fall within State rather than Commonwealth offences courts have invariably found that there is no realistic alternative to a custodial sentence and in most cases a sentence of full-time custody. 
        
       
       
        
        In this case I am prepared to find on the balance of probabilities that the offender used child pornography for his own personal reasons resulting from the subjective factors which I shall consider later. He had no intention of sharing them with others even though the software found by the police was capable of being used for that purpose. In the circumstances I would have to place both the child pornography offences at the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness for such offences, but at a level where there is no real alternative to a full-time custodial sentence.” 
        
       
      
    15 In relation to the offence against the young person his Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “From all the evidence, I conclude that C and the offender had known each other for some years before the sexual relationship began. Both their fathers were involved in the restaurant industry. C’s father employed the offender’s father as a chef in his restaurant, and the offender worked in the restaurant as a waiter, at first casually and after he discontinued his university studies on a much more regular basis. He met C at the restaurant. There was no suggestion that the offender had ever attempted to groom C for sexual activity, rather, on the balance of probabilities, I would find that while both were willing participants all the sexual activity between the two took place at the offender’s home which C regularly visited, truanting from school at times to do so. I infer from the statements made by the offender to various professionals, and from the journal kept by C, that she was often the initiator of sexual activity. At no time could I infer that she did not consent to the sexual activity with the offender. She willingly participated in drinking games and on one occasion had been the subject of images and videos of the two engaging in sexual intercourse. 
        
       
       
        
        Because of the age of C consent in law is not relevant but it must be considered for the purposes of sentencing. If it were not for the disparity in ages the relationship shows every indication of being the close and loving relationship between boyfriend and girlfriend on an equal basis. However, I cannot ignore the fact that at the time these offences began the offender was in his early twenties and C was within two months of her fourteenth birthday. Offences involving sexual activities with young people under the age of sixteen are regarded as serious because the law presumes that such people do not have the emotional maturity to be able to make informed judgments about activities which may have very serious consequences for them. Where it is shown to be the case that the victim of the offence is a truly vulnerable person exposed to a sexual predator, the offence is extremely serious, but I am not satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that is the case here. 
        
       
       
        
        As I have said, if it had not been for the age disparity it would be possible, particularly given the psychological and psychiatric evidence about the state of the offender’s maturity and the clear demonstration of C’s relative sophistication and maturity for her age, to regard the relationship as innocent. Nevertheless, I cannot regard what the offender did in this relationship as being entirely innocent because it was unlawful, the fact of which he was clearly aware, and of which he admitted being aware. 
        
       
       
        
        …” 
        
       
      
    16 The sentencing judge said with respect to the charges “it is clear that parliament regards all these offences as being extremely serious”. However, in relation to the child pornography offences his Honour said: “I would have to place both the child pornography offences at the lower end of the spectrum of seriousness for such offences, but at a level where there is no real alternative to a full-time custodial sentence.” 
     
      
    17 In relation to the sexual offences against a young person, his Honour said: “The offences, notwithstanding the young age of C, and the fact that on one occasion the two consumed a significant amount of alcohol before engaging in sexual intercourse, in my view the offences fall within the lowest range of seriousness for such offences.” 
     
      
    18 The sentencing judge made generally positive findings in relation to rehabilitation and risk of re-offending and made a finding of special circumstances. 
     
      
    19 His Honour was also mindful of the fact that the respondent had been in custody before sentencing. He was held in protective custody and because of his potential to take his own life he had been placed on suicide watch in appropriate accommodation. 
     
      
    20 The sentencing judge concluded that he could not be satisfied that any of the aggravating factors in s 21A of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act were relevant. His Honour provided a separate heading in his remarks for his discussion referred to as “discount.” He records that the prosecution did not dispute that the respondent was entitled to significant discounts for a number of reasons, which included that he pleaded guilty to all of the offences at the first available opportunity and with respect to the child pornography offences he cooperated with the authorities when they arrived at his residence, readily admitting to possessing the offending material. His Honour was satisfied that there was no evidence that the applicant intended to make the pornographic material available to anyone else. His Honour was also satisfied that the respondent had expressed remorse for this offence. 
     
      
    21 In relation to the sexual offences relating to C his Honour considered there were a number of additional factors in the respondent’s favour. His Honour concluded that neither the police nor anyone else would have had any idea that the offender had been in a sexual relationship with C unless he had admitted it during the execution of the search warrant when the police discovered the diary that she had given to him. He freely admitted to the police that he had had a sexual relationship with C, the time at which it started and the age that she was at that time. 
     
      
    22 His Honour was satisfied that the offender was entitled to a greater than usual discount in respect of both the child pornography offences and the sexual offences. His Honour indicated that in relation to the child pornography offences there would be a discount in the order of 35%. In respect of the sexual offences his Honour concluded that if he had decided to impose a custodial sentence the discount would be 40%. However, his Honour concluded that it was appropriate to mitigate the sentence in other ways and confined the sentence to a good behaviour bond. 
     
      
    23 The original Crown appeal contained one ground being that the sentences were manifestly inadequate. This was later amended to include the following five grounds: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: His Honour erred in determining the objective seriousness of the child pornography offences. 
       
       
      Ground 2: His Honour erred in determining the objective seriousness of the sexual offences against a young person. 
       
       
      Ground 3: His Honour erred in failing to give proper regard to the factor of general deterrence in the sentencing process with respect to both sets of offences. 
       
       
      Ground 4: His Honour erred in giving too much weight to the subjective case of the respondent. 
       
       
      Ground 5: His Honour erred in imposing sentences that are manifestly inadequate. 
       
      
    24 In essence the Crown submitted that his Honour erred when identifying the objective circumstances of the offences and gave too much weight to the respondent’s subjective case. The Crown acknowledged that before it could make good the criticism of his Honour’s determination of the seriousness of the offences error must be demonstrated (House v The King (1936) 55 CLR 499).  
     
      
    25 In support of ground 1 in the Notice of Appeal it was submitted that when determining the seriousness of the offences his Honour had accepted as relevant the fact that the respondent used child pornography for his own personal reasons and that he had no intention of sharing them with others. The Crown emphasised that in R v Booth [2009] NSWCCA 89 this Court indicated that it was irrelevant to the offence that the person committing it did not further distribute the material and had no intention of disseminating it. If these further activities were involved in the offending there are separate offences provided by the Crimes Act (see s 91H(2); see also SKA v R [2009] NSWCCA 186 per Simpson J at [194]). 
     
      
    26 To my mind there is substance in the Crown’s submission. His Honour did have regard to the fact that the respondent maintained his collection of images for his own use and not for further distribution and has inappropriately diminished the seriousness of the offence. However, whether as a consequence this Court should intervene to impose a more severe sentence is another matter. 
     
      
    27 With respect to the sexual offences against C as is apparent from the extract from his Honour’s remarks on sentence at [15] above the sentencing judge described the way in which the relationship was formed concluding that it resulted from the respondent’s immaturity and need for affection. The Crown criticised this analysis by reference to the decision of this Court in R v Way [2004] NSWCCA 131; 60 NSWLR 168 and submitted that the respondent’s immaturity is not one of the factors which impinges upon the mens rea of the offender. I accept that in the sense contemplated in Way (at [86]). The emotional immaturity and motivations of an offender in the present circumstances may not impinge upon the mens rea of the offence. However, as his Honour was doing no more than considering the circumstances of the offence it was appropriate for him to make findings in relation to how the relationship was formed and its impact upon the victim.  
     
      
    28 The sentencing judge was presented with a difficult sentencing exercise. As I have indicated this Court has been careful to identify principles which are appropriate when sentencing in cases of child pornography. Regrettably with the advent of the internet this type of offending has significantly increased and the misery and harm which it causes to others will also have increased. The offences are serious and, as his Honour identified, will in most cases require a custodial sentence. 
     
      
    29 The Crown was critical of his Honour’s description of the content of the computer files which the respondent maintained. It was submitted that his Honour inappropriately diminished the depravity involved. I have included the relevant passage from his Honour’s remarks at [14] above. I have no doubt that his Honour carefully chose the words by which the images were described and I am satisfied that his Honour did not diminish the breadth or apparent depravity of the images noting that some, although a tiny fraction of the whole, depicted bestiality or sadism and there were a few images of homosexual activity between males.  
     
      
    30 The sentences which his Honour ultimately imposed for the pornography offences were significantly ameliorated by the subjective factors which his Honour identified. As I have previously indicated these matters were separately stated and were not utilised by his Honour to diminish the respondent’s culpability. Although the resulting sentences were relatively modest I am not persuaded that they are of a level which requires the intervention of this Court. 
     
      
    31 The sexual offending with C raises different considerations. The respondent was 22 years of age when the relationship commenced and C was 13 years of age. Notwithstanding the fact that his Honour found that the relationship was consensual and there was no evidence that C had been damaged by it the law has provided a range of offences to protect young persons, who without appreciating it, may be vulnerable to the sexual advances of others. Our community has indicated through the Parliament that such relationships are forbidden and if they occur the older person will be severely punished. It may be that if the offender was of a significantly younger age than that of the respondent at the time of the offences a more benign attitude would be appropriate. In my view this was a serious offence which warranted a custodial sentence in addition to the sentences imposed for the pornography offences. In sentencing as he did I am satisfied that his Honour both failed to categorise the offending at the appropriate level and allowed the respondent’s subjective circumstances to inappropriately influence the sentencing outcome. 
     
      
       
      What should this Court do? 
       
      
    32 Because this is a Crown appeal this Court must exercise its functions having regard to s 68A Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 which came into effect on 24 September 2009. Although the court retains a discretion with respect to Crown appeals the principle of double jeopardy is no longer relevant (see R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49 at [92], [95], [141], [205], [209]). 
     
      
    33 Having identified an error in the sentencing process this Court is required to consider whether it should intervene or whether in the exercise of its discretion the appeal should be dismissed. The Court must consider not only the particular offences but also all of the circumstances of the respondent at the time of considering this appeal. 
     
      
    34 The respondent was taken into custody on 10 December 2008, was not released on bail and accordingly remained in prison until he was sentenced. The circumstances in which he did not obtain bail are not apparent. However, the effect of the sentencing judge’s orders was that the respondent was ordered to be released to parole on the day that he was sentenced. Upon his release he went to live again with his family. For a time he mostly stayed at home. When he went out he was scared and afraid that people would recognise him and that he would be publicly shunned. He said that he reacts with the shivers every time he sees a police car. He said that “he felt lost.” After a period and having developed a sense of directionlessness about his life he decided to take positive steps to enable him to take a place in society. He found employment as a waiter and says that his life is now more fulfilled. He said that he now wants to further his studies and has signed up for a web design course at TAFE and he seeks to pursue studies in that area. He said that he is conscious of the debt he owes to his parents who have supported him throughout his ordeal and seeks to earn monies in order to redress that situation. 
     
      
    35 The respondent gave evidence of the psychological counselling he has been receiving. He said on the day after his sentence hearing he went to the Parole office and put his name down to seek the assistance of a Parole officer. An officer was not available for some weeks after which he was told that he would have to take a course to help him with his sex offending. He is currently waiting for assignment to such a course.  
     
      
    36 Because the respondent was not assigned a psychologist from the State he decided to seek private assistance. He has been seeing a private psychologist who has been helping him with advice about his life, family and issues of self esteem and developing maturity.  
     
      
    37 In his affidavit the respondent expressed significant remorse both towards C’s parents and his own family. As I have indicated his evidence was not challenged and there can be no doubt his remorse is genuine. 
     
      
    38 At the sentence hearing evidence was given to the sentencing judge of the circumstances in which the respondent had been required to serve his period in custody. For any person the circumstances were arduous being confined to a small cell with little access to other persons and limited opportunities for exercise. Given his age, personality and the nature of his offence it is apparent that if he was now to be returned to custody his incarceration would be significantly more onerous than for the ordinary prisoner. 
     
      
    39 Notwithstanding the serious nature of the offences and my view that the sexual relationship offences required a sentence of imprisonment I am satisfied that this Court should not intervene. The respondent has already spent a period in full time custody and given his personal circumstances that punishment has been more severe than it may have been for others. Upon his release he has taken it upon himself to pursue activities and seek assistance which will enable him to develop into a mature and responsible adult. If he was now returned to prison his progress towards effective rehabilitation would be interrupted. Although the respondent is an adult and must be sentenced as such, his emotional immaturity at the time of the offending distinguish him from the ordinary case where an adult becomes involved in a sexual relationship with a young person in which event both personal and general deterrence are of greater significance than in the present case. 
     
      
    40 In my opinion the appeal should be dismissed.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: This is a Crown appeal against the sentence imposed on Clinton Parkinson (“the respondent”). The respondent pleaded guilty to one count of supplying the prohibited drug methylamphetamine in a quantity greater than the commercial quantity (563.3 grams) in contravention of s 25(2) of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act 1995 and two offences of selling a pistol to a person not authorised to possess it in contravention of s 51(1A)(a) of the Firearms Act 1996. Each offence attracted a maximum penalty of imprisonment for 20 years and has a standard non-parole period of 10 years.  
     
      
    2 The sentencing judge was also asked to have regard to offences on two Forms 1. The offences on the first Form 1 were an offer to supply a prohibited drug (2 ounces of methylamphetamine) and possessing a prohibited drug (cannabis seed and cannabis leaf). On the second Form 1 there were two offences being selling a prohibited weapon to a person not authorised to possess it and possessing a prohibited weapon without a permit. 
     
      
    3 The sentencing judge sentenced the offender as follows: 
     
      
       
      a. With respect to the offence of supplying a prohibited drug, and having regard to the 3 offences on the first Form 1 a non parole period of 2 years and 9 months with an overall sentence of 6 years. 
       
       
      b. In relation to count 2 selling a pistol to a person unauthorised to possess it taking into account two offences on the second Form 1 imprisonment for a fixed term of 3 years. 
       
       
      c. In relation to count 3, selling pistol to a person unauthorised to possess it imprisonment for a fixed term of 2 years. 
       
      
    4 The overall effective sentence was a term of imprisonment of 7 years with a non-parole period of 3 years and 9 months. 
     
      
    5 The respondent was sentenced on 15 May 2009. The Director of Public Prosecutions signed a notice of appeal on 23 June 2009. The appeal was heard on 24 September 2009 but judgment has been delayed by the necessity to await the decision in R v JW which considered s 68A of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001. The Director asserted that the sentencing judge’s discretion has miscarried and submitted that both the individual sentences and the overall sentence are manifestly inadequate. 
     
      
       
      Facts 
       
      
    6 The Crown has provided a useful summary of the relevant facts which I gratefully adopt. 
     
      
    7 The respondent was arrested pursuant to Operation Roll, a combined task force between the State Crime Command, Drug Squad and the Albury Drug Unit formed by the Albury Drug Unit to target the respondent and his involvement in the supply of amphetamines and firearms in the Albury and surrounding area. 
     
      
    8 From 18 June 2008 until the arrest of the respondent on 17 September 2008 a covert police operative (CPO) made ten controlled purchases from the respondent, acquiring a total of 563.3 grams of methylamphetamine (count 1). 
     
      
    9 On 18 June 2008 the CPO attended the respondent’s home at West Albury. They discussed the purchase of amphetamine as well as the respondent’s ability to source illegal firearms. The CPO purchased 13.9 grams of methylamphetamine (purity 6.5%) for $1750.00 cash. 
     
      
    10 On 25 June 2008 the respondent and the CPO met by prior arrangement. They drove to a residential address at West Albury where the respondent introduced the CPO to the occupant, Dwayne Meiers. Mr Meiers removed a quantity of amphetamine from the roof cavity. The CPO was supplied with 27.8 grams of methylamphetamine (purity 7%) in exchange for $3300.00 cash. 
     
      
    11 On 10 July 2008 the respondent and the CPO met by prior arrangement. The respondent supplied the CPO with 27.8 grams of methylamphetamine (purity 4%) in exchange for $3300.00 cash. The respondent and the CPO discussed the supply of firearms and the respondent’s capacity to supply a taser gun. 
     
      
    12 On 16 July 2008 the CPO arrived at the respondent’s home by prior arrangement. At the same time, Joshua Barns left the respondent’s home in a vehicle belonging to the respondent. Shortly afterwards, the respondent and the CPO entered the CPO’s vehicle and began to drive towards Wodonga along the Causeway. Whilst travelling, the CPO handed the respondent $3600.00 cash, $3300.00 being for one ounce of methylamphetamine and $300.00 being for a taser gun. The respondent counted the money, directed the CPO to a car park in Wodonga and made a telephone call on the CPO’s telephone, apparently to arrange for assistance to complete the supply. In the car park the respondent met with Joshua Barns. The respondent supplied the CPO with 27.6 grams of methylamphetamine (purity 5%) and a taser gun (first matter on the second Form 1) whereupon the respondent left with Mr Burns in the respondent’s vehicle. 
     
      
    13 On 23 July 2008 following a lengthy discussion about the logistics of the supply of firearms, the CPO accompanied the respondent home where the respondent supplied the CPO with 13.2 grams of methylamphetamine (purity 7%) for $2400.00 cash. 
     
      
    14 On 6 August 2008 the respondent and the CPO met by prior arrangement and drove in the CPO’s vehicle to a car park in Albury. On the way, the CPO provided the respondent with $6500.00 cash which the respondent counted. The respondent met with Dwayne Meiers in the car park. The respondent then supplied the CPO with 55.1 grams of methylamphetamine (purity 2.5%). 
     
      
    15 On 13 August 2008 the respondent and the CPO met by prior arrangement in West Albury. The respondent supplied the CPO with 54.6 grams of methylamphetamine (purity 3%) in exchange for $6500.00. The respondent and the CPO negotiated for the supply of a further two ounces of methylamphetamine and a firearm in the coming days. 
     
      
    16 On 14 August 2008 the respondent, Joshua Barns and the CPO went to lunch together in Albury. Mr Barns departed the lunch venue first. Shortly afterwards, the respondent and the CPO drove to a residential address in West Albury. Mr Barns came out of the front door and handed to the CPO a .22 calibre pistol and 96 .22 calibre rounds (count 2). 
     
      
    17 On 15 August 2008 the CPO attended the respondent’s home from where they travelled together to a residential address in West Albury. The respondent supplied the CPO with 55.2 grams of methylamphetamine (purity 3.5%) for $6500.00 cash. 
     
      
    18 On 28 August 2008 the CPO attended the respondent’s home where the respondent offered and produced 2 ounces of methylamphetamine to the CPO. On that occasion the CPO declined to purchase the drug (first matter on the first Form 1). 
     
      
    19 On 11 September 2008 the CPO attended the respondent’s home by prior arrangement. The respondent entered the CPO’s vehicle and handed him 45.4 grams of methylamphetamine (purity 2%). The respondent and the CPO proceeded to a café for lunch, where they further discussed the capacity of the respondent to supply firearms. After lunch they re-entered the CPO’s vehicle where the CPO handed to the respondent $6500.00 cash for the methylamphetamine and $3000.00 cash as forward payment for a firearm (count 3). 
     
      
    20 On 17 September 2008 the respondent and the CPO met in a car park in East Albury by prior arrangement where the respondent supplied the CPO with 242.7 grams of methylamphetamine (purity 2%). The respondent was subsequently conveyed to Albury police station and arrested. 
     
      
    21 Pursuant to a search warrant executed on the respondent’s premises the same day, police located a small plastic bag containing cannabis seeds (second matter on the first Form 1), a flick knife (second matter on the second Form 1) and a small piece of silver foil containing cannabis (third matter on the first Form 1). 
     
      
       
      Subjective circumstances 
       
      
    22 The respondent was 26 years old at the date of sentencing. He did not give evidence at the sentencing hearing. Her Honour provided a summary of his criminal record in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “He has a significant criminal record in New South Wales and Victoria, including driving matters, minor drug matters, a minor weapons matter and stalking matters, as well as the assault occasioning actual bodily harm matter … There are also some dishonesty matters. He has spent brief periods in custody on remand. He has never served a full time sentence of imprisonment or indeed, a periodic detention order. He has been the lucky beneficiary of a series of s 12 suspended sentences. In 2006 there was a firearms matter and a possess prohibited drug matter that resulted in fines. In 2004 a stalking matter resulted in a s 9 bond. There was a call up for breach and that led to the imposition of s 12 bond. There are several driving matters that resulted in s 12 suspended sentences. In 2003, there was a matter of possessing a prohibited weapon. I am told it was an ornamental mace. There was a minor drug matter. Each conviction resulting in the imposition of a fine. In 2003 there was a stalking matter in Victoria and a threat to kill matter resulting in a total of a four month suspended sentence. There are no prior offences of supply drugs. The firearms and weapons matters must have been minor because only small fines were imposed.” 
        
       
      
    23 The respondent’s parents separated when he was seven years old. This caused him some difficulty. He also suffered great difficulty in learning and is described as being illiterate. He left school in year 9. He claims to be self-employed in a motor spare parts business and with the assistance of a mortgage purchased his own home. He was in a permanent relationship which came to an end when he was arrested and taken into custody.  
     
      
       
      Remarks on sentence 
       
      
    24 The sentencing judge made the following findings in relation to the offence of supplying a prohibited drug: 
     
      
       
        
        “25 There were ten episodes of actual supply. The supply was to an operative rather than to somebody who passed the drugs on to an end user. That is a matter of relevance, but not enormous relevance. As far as the respondent is concerned, he thought he was supplying to someone who would pass the drugs to end users. 
        
       
       
        
        26 The quantity of the drugs is middle range in terms of the commercial quantity of the substance. … It is to some extent relevant that the purity of the drug was low, particularly after July when the operative requested increasingly larger amounts of the drug, and the purity decreased in inverse proportion to the quantity that was supplied. Her Honour said: ‘I agree with the Crown’s submission that drug sellers may dilute the purity of drugs for the purpose of increasing profit, and that was no doubt a consideration in relation to this matter.’ 
        
       
       
        
        27 A matter that is of relevance is that the operative requested escalating amounts of the drug, and the respondent responded to those requests … it is quite clear that the respondent was ready and willing to meet any request because the greater the quantity of the drug then the larger the profit that would flow to him. 
        
       
       
        
        28 … The overall financial value of the transactions was very substantial. Undoubtedly the respondent engaged in the transactions for the purpose of making a substantial financial gain. 
        
       
       
        
        29 … The respondent was a negotiator who was able to organise whatever was required in relation to the acquisition of the drugs. He played a very active role. The offence is somewhere in the mid-range of objective seriousness, but somewhere towards the lower end of mid-range.” 
        
       
      
    25 In relation to the firearms offences the sentencing judge made the following findings: 
     
      
       
        
        “30 The respondent did not have firearms in his immediate possession to supply to the operative. However, he was able to obtain items … [and] he was involved in the negotiations. 
        
       
       
        
        31 [A]s he knew the firearm was being supplied to a drug dealer, the offence of supplying the firearm was more serious than supplying an illegal firearm to someone who has apparently a quasi-legitimate purpose for wanting the firearm. 
        
       
       
        
        32 In summary the offence of supply firearm on 14 August was an offence of significant seriousness. … Because I have limited information about the pistol I do not believe that I am qualified to say where it lies in relation to mid-range of objective seriousness, but certainly it is not at the lowest end of the range of objective seriousness. It is a matter of significant seriousness. 
        
       
       
        
        33 The offence on 11 September is of less objective seriousness, only because the operative did not receive the firearm or firearms that were discussed. Quite likely firearms would have been supplied but for the arrest on 17 September. Nevertheless, the offence of 11 September is an offence of negotiation, not actual supply.” 
        
       
      
    26 In relation to all three matters her Honour made additional findings. Her Honour found that the fact that the respondent was on conditional liberty at the time of the offences was a matter of aggravation. Her Honour found that the respondent displayed little insight into his conduct. The only mitigating factor was his plea of guilty.  
     
      
       
      Crown submissions 
       
      
    27 The Crown submitted that her Honour had made seven significant errors when sentencing. They were described as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “1. In determining that the offence of supply commercial quantity of prohibited drug fell towards the lower end of the mid-range of objective seriousness. 
        
       
       
        
        2. In failing to give proper reasons for not applying the standard non-parole period to the offence of supply commercial quantity of prohibited drug. 
        
       
       
        
        3. In determining a starting point of eight years for the supply commercial quantity of prohibited drug offence. 
        
       
       
        
        4. In failing to determine where in the range of objective seriousness the firearm offence of 14 August (selling a .22 calibre Ruger pistol to a person unauthorised to posses it), fell. 
        
       
       
        
        5. In determining that the second firearm offence (charge 3) was less serious than the first firearm offence (charge 2). 
        
       
       
        
        6. In setting fixed terms for the two firearm offences. 
        
       
       
        
        7. In failing to take into account matters relevant to the determination of whether the sentences should be ordered to be served concurrently or otherwise and erred in imposing wholly concurrent sentences for the two firearm offences, and only accumulating the sentence for the drug offence by twelve months.” 
        
       
      
    28 The sentencing judge found the supply prohibited drug offence to be “somewhere in the mid-range of objective seriousness, but somewhere towards the lower end of mid-range.” It was submitted that in characterising the objective criminality at the lower end of the mid-range her Honour erred. Because the total quantity of methylamphetamine was 563.5 grams which is in excess of twice the minimum commercial quantity of 250 grams and there were ten episodes of actual supply, being sales of drugs for profit, the Crown submitted that the only appropriate classification was that the offence was serious. The Crown submitted that the offence was marked by the fact that a significant sum of money, in excess of $30,000 changed hands and furthermore having regard to the multiplicity of offences it was apparent that the respondent played an active role in the drug trade. It was submitted that he was “trafficking to a substantial degree” and that the offence fell “well above” the mid-range of objective seriousness. 
     
      
    29 In R v Dang [2005] NSWCCA 430 Howie J said at [24]: 
     
      
       
        
        “Clearly there will be a range of factors that are relevant to a determination of whether an offence of supplying a prohibited drug falls within the mid-range of seriousness. The amount and purity of the drug will be significant matters but they are not decisive.  
        Way  
        at [159]. The number of occasions on which the drug was supplied, the motivation for the supply, the planning involved and the role of the offender in the supply are obviously relevant matters. In  
        R v Shi  
        [2004] NSWCCA 135 at [35], [37]-[38] Wood CJ at CL stated: 
        
       
       
        
         
          
          As was decided in Regina v Way the determination of the objective seriousness of the offence before the Court is not confined to a consideration of the circumstances which are specifically listed in s 21A(2) and (3). The motive of an offender or any condition which affects the offender’s state of mind which impinges upon the elements comprised within the mens rea is of relevance, although less so in the case of any condition which is self induced through abuse of alcohol or drugs.” 
          
         
        
       
      
    30 The Crown emphasised that there were no mitigating factors which impinged upon the elements comprising the mens rea of this offence. The respondent did not use either alcohol or drugs but was involved in an ongoing criminal enterprise. Although the drugs were supplied to an undercover operative and were not actually disseminated into the community this Court has previously indicated that this has no bearing on the respondent’s moral culpability for the offence: R v Truong [2006] NSWCCA 318 at [26] and [47]; R v Chan [1999] NSWCCA 103. 
     
      
    31 The respondent drew attention to decisions of this Court where it has been indicated that the question of whether an offence falls within the mid range of seriousness is a matter of judgment on which minds may differ. It has been described as “quintessentially for the sentencing judge”; Dang at [22] and R v Mulato [2006] NSWCCA 282 at [46]. It was also emphasised that the drugs which were supplied were of low purity and as the volume in the transaction increased the purity decreased. 
     
      
       
      Consideration 
       
      
    32 To my mind the volume and frequency of the transactions confirm that the respondent was engaged in a significant drug enterprise in breach of the law. His purpose was profit from the sale of drugs which he expected would be distributed in the community. If I was sentencing at first instance I would have concluded that the offence was at least mid range. However, mindful of the statements of this Court that the determination of the objective seriousness of the offence is primarily a matter for the sentencing judge I would not for this reason have intervened to resentence. However, I will consider later whether the sentence imposed was appropriate even for a finding that the objective seriousness fell towards the “lower end of the mid range of objective seriousness.” 
     
      
    33 The Crown complained that her Honour failed to comply with s 54B(4) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 and adequately explain her reasons for concluding that there could be a departure from the standard non-parole period. In R v Mills [2005] NSWCCA 175 Wood CJ at CL said at [49] that a statement which gives a clear identification of the relevant factors, the weight given to them and their role in the structuring of the sentence is required. See also R v Walker [2005] NSWCCA 109. 
     
      
    34 In the present case her Honour was entitled to depart from the standard non-parole period by reason of the respondent’s guilty plea: R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168 at [68]. However, this was the only reason which justified a departure and there were matters which pointed the other way. The respondent was on conditional liberty at the time the supply offence was being committed. He has a lengthy criminal history. There was no evidence of remorse and her Honour found that she could not conclude that there were prospects of his rehabilitation. 
     
      
    35 The respondent emphasised that her Honour did give careful consideration to the finding which she made of special circumstances. Although this is true, beyond stating her finding as to where the offences lay on the spectrum of objective seriousness her Honour did not provide reasons for departing from the standard non-parole period. Although by reason of the guilty pleas the standard non-parole periods were not directly relevant they remained a “benchmark or guide post” for the sentencing judge (R v Way (2004) 60 NSWLR 168; [2004] NSWCCA 131; R v AJP (2004) 150 A Crim R 575; [2004] NSWCCA 434. 
     
      
    36 The obligation to provide reasons for departing from a standard non-parole period was no doubt intended by the Parliament to ensure that unless reasons for departure could be identified and articulated, sentencing judges would impose the standard non-parole period. Because the standard non-parole periods identified by the Parliament are in many case greater than the range of non-parole periods which the courts were commonly imposing for the relevant offences it could be expected that, unless judges were required to give careful consideration to any reasons for departing from the standard, the impact of the standard non-parole period on sentencing regimes may be less than intended. This Court has remarked on previous occasions on the apparent failure in many cases of sentencing judges to have proper regard to and impose penalties consistent with, standard non-parole periods: R v Knight; R v Biuvanua [2007] 176 A Crim R 338. It is more likely that problems will arise when a trial judge does not comply with his or her obligations under s 54B(4). The reasons need not be elaborate but must make plain the matters which justify the departure. 
     
      
    37 In the present case, as I have indicated, there was only one matter, being the guilty plea, which justified a departure from the standard non-parole period. When the period of 10 years is compared with the non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months provided for the drug offence it is clear that the sentencing discretion has miscarried. This may not have occurred if the sentencing judge had exposed her reasoning process. 
     
      
    38 When delivering her remarks on sentence the sentencing judge stated that in relation to count 1 the starting point for calculating the sentence was 8 years but that she discounted that figure by 25% because of the plea of guilty resulting in a 6 year sentence. If, as appears likely, her Honour arrived at the 8 year period because this was a figure which was justified by the offence being at the lower end of the mid-range it is plain that error has occurred. The 10 year period provided by the statute is the non-parole period not the overall term. Appropriate regard for the standard non-parole period, even with a guilty plea, would have provided an overall term well in excess of 6 years. 
     
      
    39 The error which the Crown identified is similar to that which occurred in R v Burgess [2006] NSWCCA 319. But for the plea of guilty the non-parole period in the present case should have been close to the standard non-parole period of 10 years which was the position in Burgess. By providing a non-parole period of 2 years and 9 months her Honour has imposed a sentence which was grossly inadequate and which requires the intervention of this Court. 
     
      
    40 The Crown submitted that the offence of selling a pistol to an unauthorised person was also an offence of significant seriousness. Although her Honour said that a lack of information meant that she could not determine where the offence lay in relation to the mid-range of objective seriousness she nevertheless concluded that it was a matter of significant seriousness. It was submitted that by so doing her Honour erred. 
     
      
    41 The prohibited pistol the subject of the charge was a .22 calibre Ruger pistol which was found with 96 rounds of ammunition. The weapon was in working order and as her Honour found could inflict a lethal wound upon any human being. The evidence before her Honour confirmed that it was a pistol as defined in s 41 of the Firearms Act and was of a self-loading type. 
     
      
    42 Her Honour’s conclusion that she was not able to say where the offence lay on the mid-range of objective seriousness, because she had limited information about the pistol is at odds with the evidence which was before her. Her Honour received the expert certificate confirming the nature of the weapon and there is nothing in the Firearms Act which distinguishes different sorts of pistols making the sale of one a more serious offence than the sale of another. The respondent was an active drug dealer and the evidence before the sentencing judge indicated that he had been engaged in a number of conversations about the supply of prohibited weapons. This offence was not an isolated act of criminality. 
     
      
    43 The sentencing judge found that the second firearm offence was less serious than the first only because the pistol was never supplied. The reason for the pistol not being supplied was that the respondent was arrested and the criminal enterprise accordingly interrupted. However, the sale had been agreed. It was only the delivery of the weapon which was not completed. 
     
      
    44 With respect to both firearm offences the respondent submitted that because the respondent was a principal but in the nature of an agent for the sale of the weapons his offending fell below the mid-range. It was submitted that it was apparent from the fact that there was a delay between when the undercover officer requested a firearm and its supply that the respondent played only a minor part in any illegal gun supply activity. The respondent stressed that there was no evidence of any significant profit to the respondent from these transactions. 
     
      
    45 I am satisfied, that the Crown’s submission, that there was sufficient known about the weapon to enable the sentencing judge to make a finding of the effective seriousness of the offence is made good. The weapon was appropriately described and its lethal nature adequately explained. However, the objective seriousness of the offence depended in part upon the respondent’s role in the gun supply activity. I am satisfied that the evidence proved that the respondent was an agent for others who were engaged in the business of illegally supplying weapons and for this reason his offending fell below the mid-range. 
     
      
    46 The Crown submitted that the sentencing judge erred by setting a fixed term for the 2 firearm offences and failing to impose a non-parole period. The submission derives from s 45(1) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act 1999 which provides that other than for an offence for which there is a standard non-parole period a court may decline to set a non-parole period. This has been interpreted so as to require the sentence for an offence for which a standard non-parole period is provided to impose both a period of full time custody and a period on parole: see SCJ v R [2008] NSWCCA 258 at [76]; Ku v R [2008] NSWCCA 258; Graham v R [2008] NSWCCA 309; KC v R [2009] NSWCCA 110. 
     
      
    47 It was conceded in the present case, as it was in those earlier decisions, that the sentencing judge erred. In those circumstances whether that concession has been rightly made need not be determined. However, I note that s 45(1) is concerned with the circumstances where a court may decline to set a non-parole period for an offence where a standard non-parole period has not been provided. It is not concerned with offences where a standard non-parole period has been set. 
     
      
    48 The Crown submitted that each of the errors which I have discussed all contributed to entirely inadequate sentences being imposed. The respondent accepted that all of the sentences fell at the low end of the appropriate range. The respondent emphasised that during the course of the proceedings the sentencing judge indicated that she had looked at relevant statistics and considered that the non-parole period for the drug offence fell within a range of 2 to 4½ years and for the gun offences within the range of 1 or 2 years. The prosecutor did not take issue with these statements. For this reason it was submitted that if, as has been submitted on the appeal, sentences within the range suggested by her Honour were manifestly inadequate the Crown had a duty to assist the sentencing judge to avoid appellable error. It was submitted that as this did not occur the court’s discretion to refuse to intervene despite the error demonstrated was enlivened, See R v Chad unreported 13 May 1997 NSWCCA. 
     
      
    49 The principles which have traditionally applied to a Crown appeal against sentence are well known. They were summarised in R v Wall (2002) NSWCCA 42 at [70]. However, following the enactment of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Amendment (Double Jeopardy) Act 2009 those principles have changed. Although considerations relating to matters of double jeopardy are no longer relevant this Court retains a discretion not to intervene: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49.  
     
      
    50 In the present matter I am in no doubt that error has occurred. Both the individual sentences and the total sentence are substantially below that which was appropriate. I acknowledge that when the sentencing judge received submissions in relation to sentence she indicated the range which she had in mind as being appropriate and the Crown prosecutor did not demur. Although in some circumstances a discussion between the prosecutor and the judge may be of such significance that this Court for that reason could determine that no error had occurred that was not this case. Passive acquiescence by the prosecutor cannot lead to a finding that no error has occurred when the sentence, as in this case, fell so significantly below that which was appropriate. 
     
      
    51 Although before the amending Act sentences at the lowest end of the range should be imposed by this Court this is no longer the case: R v JW [2010] NSWCCA 49. With respect to the drug offence her Honour found that offence to be at the lower end of the mid-range of objective seriousness. The respondent pleaded guilty and her Honour found that he was entitled to the full 25% discount for that plea. The amount of prohibited drug was more than twice the minimum and involved ten episodes of supply and the sentence for this count must have regard to the matters on the Form 1. 
     
      
    52 There is nothing of particular significance in the respondent’s subjective case. The offences were committed for profit, the respondent being a non user of either alcohol or drugs. 
     
      
    53 To my mind the appropriate sentence for the first count, having appropriate regard to the standard non-parole period as a guide and mindful of the matters on the Form 1, was a non-parole period of 6 years with an overall term of 8 years. 
     
      
    54 I have already indicated that to my mind the firearm offences fell below the mid-range of objective seriousness. However, even though the respondent was effectively acting as the middle man the offences were serious and call for a significantly greater punishment than was imposed by her Honour. Although, of course, they were separate criminal acts I would, as did her Honour, propose concurrent sentences for these offences. There were also the offences on the Form 1 which required consideration, although of less significance having regard to their relationship with the principal offences. For these offences I would impose a non-parole period of 4½ years with an overall term of 7½ years. 
     
      
    55 Totality is a difficult issue. Making the penalties for the firearm offences concurrent provides the respondent a significant benefit. With that in mind I would commence the sentence for those offences four years before the completion of the non-parole period of the sentence for the first count. 
     
      
    56 The sentencing judge found special circumstances which in my opinion was appropriate. The respondent will need a period of supervised relief if he is ever to establish himself as a responsible member of the community. In resentencing I have had regard to the affidavit material tendered by the respondent. 
     
      
    57 The orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. Crown appeal allowed. 
       
      2. Sentences imposed in the District Court quashed. 
       
      3. The respondent is sentenced as follows: 
       
        
        On count 1 to a non-parole period of 6 years commencing on 9 December 2008 expiring on 8 December 2014 with a balance of term of 2 years expiring on 8 December 2016. 
        
       
       
        
        On count 2 to a non-parole period of 4 years and six months commencing on 9 December 2010 and expiring on 8 June 2015 with a balance of 3 years expiring on 8 June 2018. 
        
       
       
        
        On count 3 to a non-parole period of 4 years and 6 months commencing on 9 December 2010 and expiring on 8 June 2015 with a balance of term of 3 years expiring on 8 June 2018. 
        
       
       
      Accordingly the respondent will be eligible for release to parole on 8 June 2015.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BEAZLEY JA: On 27 May 2008, the appellant was found guilty by a jury of two counts of armed robbery with an offensive weapon contrary to the provisions of the Crimes Act 1900, s 97(1) and one count of aggravated break enter and steal contrary to the Crimes Act, s 112(2). The maximum penalty for each offence is 20 years imprisonment. The offence under s 112(2) carries a standard non-parole period of 5 years. I will refer to these offences as ‘the Camden offences’, Camden being the location where the offences were committed. 
     
      
    2 The Crown case against the appellant was a circumstantial one based on his being involved in a joint criminal enterprise with two co-offenders, Raymond Hynds and Mitchell Pitman. 
     
      
    3 The appellant appeals against his conviction on the following grounds:  
     
      
       
      (1) The trial judge, Morgan DCJ, erred in law in admitting the evidence of Trudy Plackett.  
       
       
      (2) The trial miscarried when the trial judge criticised a submission made by the appellant’s counsel at trial to the jury without affording counsel the opportunity to address her Honour on the issue, in circumstances where counsel had indicated that he wished to be heard on the Crown Prosecutor’s objections to his submissions. 
       
       
      (3) The trial judge erred in failing to recuse herself and discharge the jury following the matter complained of in ground (2). 
       
       
      (4) (As amended by leave of the Court): The trial judge erred in law by failing to direct the jury that, in accordance with the decision of  
      Regina v Merritt 
       [1999] NSWCCA 29, they should not convict unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that a wallet was found in the bedroom occupied by the appellant at premises at Cobbity, New South Wales, and that the wallet was stolen from James Park during the course of the robbery. 
       
       
      Background 
       
      
    4 The offences occurred shortly after 2 am on Saturday, 25 November 2006. At that time, a group of people (five males and four females), were gathered in a flat in Camden occupied by Bradley Guernier. A man came to the door of the flat asking for “Brad”. Shortly after that, a number of the guests, including Benjamin Leeson and Mr Park, left the flat. As they were walking on the common area of the driveway, they saw a small white car drive up and park. Mr Leeson saw three men jump out of the car: the driver, a front and a back seat passenger. The description of one of these men was consistent with the appearance of Mr Hynds, one of the appellant’s co-offenders. One of the men hit Mr Leeson around the knees, head and arms a number of times with a pole or a baseball bat. Another demanded his wallet. He told them he didn’t have one, but gave the assailants his mobile phone.  
     
      
    5 Mr Park also gave evidence of being “rushed” by the man he thought had come from the back seat of the car. He was hit around his face with what he thought was “something metal”. His wallet was taken from his back pocket. The men then ran off towards Mr Guernier’s flat.  
     
      
    6 Julian Franke was on the verandah of the flat at the time. He gave evidence of seeing a white Ford Laser driving up and stopping outside the flat. He saw one person get out of the car from the passenger side and one from the back seat.  
     
      
    7 The guests who had remained inside the flat heard banging on the front door. One of them called the police. Jessie-Lee Blackwell gave evidence that there was an Australian man in a green jacket at the door who swung a “long, grey/silver metal pole” at her. Two other men were standing behind him. She slammed that door shut in an unsuccessful attempt to keep the attackers out. 
     
      
    8 Those inside the flat gave evidence of sounds of breaking glass and kicking at the front door. A voice yelled, “Ray kick the door down”. One of the men was heard to say, “We are going to kill you if Brad doesn’t come out, we will kill the dog”. Some of the guests jumped out the window. Others hid in the wardrobe of an upstairs bedroom. Mr Guernier was one of those who had remained inside the flat. He heard someone outside the flat say, “Use the gun”. He then heard banging on the coffee table and the sound of bottles being knocked over.  
     
      
    9 Those who had hidden in the wardrobe heard someone enter the bedroom, yelling “Where are youse, we’re going to kill youse, you’re dead”. Someone also said, “Kill the dog” and someone else said, “No don’t kill it”. One of the guests, Cheryl-Lee Kearns, who knew Mr Hynds, recognised one of the voices as his. 
     
      
    10 The occupants described the flat as having been “trashed”. Personal belongings had been stolen. Various occupants of the flat said that three men were involved in the attack. 
     
      
    11 A number of nearby neighbours heard the commotion and looked outside. One neighbour saw three men. Another noted the numberplate of a white Ford Laser station wagon that the men were seen running towards. Police inquiries revealed that the car was registered to Mr Pitman, one of the appellant’s co-offenders.  
     
      
    12 No one identified the appellant as one of the assailants. However, the Crown relied upon circumstantial evidence linking him with the commission of the crimes, including being in the company of the co-offenders at a time proximate to the time that the offences were committed. In addition, there was evidence of the police search of the property where the appellant was staying at the time of the offence, when items connected with the offence were found in the room he was using as his bedroom.  
     
      
    13 The first piece of circumstantial evidence relied upon was a visit by the appellant to the home of Mr Hine and Ms Plackett at Catherine Field at 8 pm on Friday 24 November 2006 (that is, about six hours before the incident at Mr Guernier’s flat at Camden). Mr Hine, Ms Plackett and a visitor at the Catherine Field home gave evidence that the appellant and his two co-offenders arrived there at about 8 pm. Mr Hine and Ms Plackett said that the three men arrived in a white Ford Laser station wagon, which the evidence established was registered in Mr Pitman’s name, and stayed for a short time. Just before they left, Ms Plackett heard either Mr Hynds or the appellant say to the other, “Let’s go and see that guy in Camden” and the other replying, “We’ll do that later”.  
     
      
    14 Ms Plackett also saw the three men driving in Mr Pitman’s car in the early evening of 26 November 2006. This sighting was not alleged to be connected in any way with the offences with which the appellant was charged, but the evidence was adduced as part of the Crown’s circumstantial case that the men were together at a time proximate to the commission of the crime. 
     
      
    15 At the time of the offences, both Mr Hynds and the appellant were living at a property at Cobbitty. There were a number of other people living there at the time, including Mr Hynds’ ex-wife and his daughter. The appellant had taken up residence a few days earlier. He was staying in a bedroom in which different people stayed from time to time and which did not have a lock on it.  
     
      
    16 On the morning of 27 November, one of residents at Cobbity, Charlie Biffen, saw Mr Hynds and the appellant returning to the house from the back of the property near the horse yards. That afternoon, police raided the Cobbitty property. In the room occupied by the appellant, police found a “bum bag” under the bed, containing a brown wallet which Mr Park later identified as his. Police also located a metal baseball bat in the appellant’s bedroom and a wooden bat with green tape around the handle. The top of the baseball bat had been cut off.  
     
      
    17 Mr Biffen directed the police towards the area from where he had seen Mr Hynds and the appellant returning earlier that day. There, under some dry grass, police found two plastic bags, one containing a jacket with the name “Brad” embroidered on it, which Mr Guernier identified as his, and the other containing Mr Leeson’s mobile phone and other mobile phones which had been taken from Mr Guernier’s flat at the time of the attack. DNA consistent with that of Mr Hynds was later located on Mr Leeson’s phone and on a green jacket located on the verandah of the Cobbitty property. The jacket was consistent with the description of a jacket worn by one of the offenders on the occasion of the commission of the offences. 
     
      
    18 Evidence at the trial was given by Mr Hynds’ ex-wife and daughter. Both said that the appellant and the two co-offenders were at the Cobbity property during the late afternoon and evening of Friday 24 November. Mr Hynds’ ex-wife said that the three men left late in the afternoon and returned about half an hour later with alcohol. They were still there when she went to bed at “probably around 2 o’clock in the morning”.  The evidence was that Cobbity is about 5-10 minutes drive from Camden, where the offences took place. Ms Hynds also agreed that she was not with the three men throughout the whole of the evening. Mr Hynds’ daughter said that the three men were at the property during the day but left, with another man, at about 6 or 6.30 pm. The appellant and the two co-offenders returned (without the other man) about 7 pm. She said they remained there the whole night, drinking, and that she went to bed at about 11 or 11.30 pm.  
     
      
       
      The issues on the appeal 
       
      
    19 The issues on the appeal are set out at [3]. The third issue raised a question of bias. In Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design and Developments Pty Ltd [2006] HCA 55; (2006) 229 CLR 557, Kirby and Crennan JJ, having observed at [117] that allegations of bias are serious, gave the following ‘direction’ to an intermediate appellate court: 
     
      
       
        
        “Allegations of this nature are serious. If made, the party making them is obliged to seek relief reflecting their seriousness. We agree generally with Callinan J's observations about the procedure followed in this case. An intermediate appellate court dealing with allegations of apprehended bias, coupled with other discrete grounds of appeal must deal with the issue of bias first. It must do this because, logically, it comes first. Actual or apprehended bias strike at the validity and acceptability of the trial and its outcome. It is for that reason that such questions should be dealt with before other, substantive, issues are decided. It should put the party making such an allegation to an election on the basis that if the allegation of apprehended bias is made out, a retrial will be ordered irrespective of possible findings on other issues. Even if a judge is found to be correct, this does not assuage the impression that there was an apprehension of bias. Furthermore, if, as here, an intermediate appellate court finds the allegation made out, but grants no relief because it otherwise finds in favour of the party making the allegation, a defect in the administration of justice has been found to have occurred which, in the absence of any successful appeal on the point, will remain unremedied. Inevitably, this adversely affects public confidence in the administration of justice. The respondents' application for leave to file a cross-appeal should be granted. However, the cross-appeal, addressed to the bias issue, should be dismissed.” (Citation omitted) 
        
       
      
    20 This ‘direction’ does not find expression in any of the other judgments. Indeed, Callinan J, whose judgment on the question of bias was substantially agreed with by all members of the Court, was of the opinion that as the Full Court of the Federal Court had disposed of the matter on other grounds, it had not been necessary for it to determine the question of bias. It is thus uncertain whether this Court is bound by the approach dictated by Kirby and Crennan JJ.  
     
      
    21 For the reasons which I give below, the appellant has not established a case of apprehended bias. Thus, the question whether this Court is bound to determine the bias issue first is not of critical importance. However, as one aspect of the bias question depends upon the determination whether her Honour’s directions to the jury were correct, it will be convenient to consider that matter (ground 4) before dealing with the miscarriage and bias grounds (grounds 2 and 3). In the first instance, however, I will deal with ground 1 of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: her Honour erred in law in admitting the evidence of Trudy Plackett 
       
      
    22 At the trial, Ms Plackett gave evidence that on 24 November 2006, she was entertaining three friends in her home at Catherine Field when, at about 8 pm, the appellant and the two co-offenders arrived. They stayed for a short time and, when they left, she observed from her living room window that they got into a Ford Laser motor vehicle. The car had been parked in front of the carport which ran alongside the living room window about 3 m away from the window. Ms Plackett recognised the vehicle as Mr Pitman’s, as she had seen him drive it on and off over the course of the previous month. She said that Mr Pitman got into the driver’s seat, but that Mr Hynds and the appellant remained standing on opposite sides of the car talking to each other over the roof. She heard one of them say, “Let’s go and see that guy in Camden” and the other responding, “We’ll do that later”. The two men then got into the car and they drove away. 
     
      
    23 In cross-examination, Ms Plackett agreed that it was dark when she was making her observations from the living room window. She also agreed that at the time, she was holding her young baby, who was crying. It was suggested to her that her attention was therefore on the baby, rather than on what was going on around her. She denied this was so and explained that she was settling her baby to sleep and that not all of her attention was focused on the baby.  
     
      
    24 Ms Plackett also gave evidence that at about 6.30 pm on Sunday 26 November, she drove past the Laser coming from the opposite direction. She identified Mr Pitman as the driver, Mr Hynds as the front passenger and the appellant in the back seat. She was challenged as to her observation of the appellant being in the car, but she reiterated, “He was sitting in the middle in the back of the car. I could see him clearly”.  
     
      
    25 Ms Plackett’s partner, Mr Hine, also gave evidence. He said that at about 7.30 pm on 24 November he was sitting in the sunroom when Mr Hynds, Mr Pitman and the appellant arrived. The men stayed for about 15 minutes before leaving. He did not see how they left, but gave evidence that they had arrived in a “beigy” Ford station wagon, which he had seen Mr Pitman driving previously.  
     
      
    26 One of the guests at the Plackett/Hine household that evening was Scott Chapman. He gave evidence that he was there when Mr Hynds, Mr Mitchell and the appellant arrived. He said it was dark, and they stayed for “probably 10, 15 minutes, 5 minutes”, leaving by the back gate. As far as he knew, the men had walked to the premises and he did not see any vehicle. However, he was “out the back” when they arrived and did not have an opportunity to observe how they arrived. 
     
      
    27 On its face, Ms Plackett’s evidence appears to be uncontroversial. However, it was, in fact, a sanitised version of what had allegedly occurred on 24 and 26 November at the Plackett/Hine household. What was alleged to have occurred on the night of 24 November was that the appellant, armed with a shotgun and in the company of Mr Hynds and Mr Pitman, went to the Plackett/Hine household at Catherine Field and assaulted both Ms Plackett and Mr Hine. The appellant was alleged to have pointed the shotgun at each of them, struck Mr Hine around the shoulder area and used his hands in a choking motion around Mr Hine’s neck. He demanded $500 in cash from each of them.  
     
      
    28 Ms Plackett’s evidence as to seeing the appellant and the other two co-offenders on Sunday 26 November in a motor vehicle was also a sanitised description of an allegation that the appellant and the co-offenders returned to the Plackett/Hine household on the Sunday evening armed with baseball bats, which they used to break down the front door. Inside the premises, they again threatened Mr Hine and demanded $500.  
     
      
    29 As a result of the allegations relating to 24 November, the appellant was charged with the offences of intimidation; assault occasioning actual bodily harm to Mr Hine; and assault of Ms Plackett. He was also charged with the offence of intimidation in respect of the 26 November incident at the Plackett/Hine household. I will refer to these collectively as ‘the Catherine Field charges’. The appellant’s trial with respect to the Catherine Field charges was held immediately preceding the trial with which this appeal is concerned. He was found not guilty of those offences. 
     
      
    30 The question as to the admissibility of Ms Plackett’s evidence was first raised prior to the commencement of the trial. The Crown informed her Honour that he intended to lead evidence from Ms Plackett which excluded any reference to the intimidating conduct or the assaults which had been alleged against the appellant and in respect of which he had been acquitted. The Crown also indicated that in respect of the incident on 26 November, Ms Plackett would give evidence that she saw Mr Pitman’s car driving near her premises, as has been detailed above, but that there would be no reference to the alleged intimidating conduct. 
     
      
    31 The Crown explained the reason for leading evidence from Ms Plackett in this sanitised form was twofold:  
     
      
       
      (1) it was an element in the circumstantial case upon which the Crown relied that the three men were together on the Friday evening at about 8 pm, about 6 hours prior to the incident at Camden; and  
       
       
      (2) secondly, it went to establishing that the three men left the Plackett/Hine premises in Mr Pitman’s car and that there was a conversation between Mr Hynds and the appellant about seeing “ 
      that guy in Camden 
      ”. 
       
      
    32 The Crown stated that it also intended to rely on the fact that the car in which the appellant was said to have left the Plackett/Hine residence was the same as that which was identified at Camden by Mr Guernier‘s neighbour. The evidence that Ms Plackett then saw the three men in the car on the Sunday evening was to be relied upon as evidence that the three men were together at a time proximate to the commission of the offences. 
     
      
    33 Counsel who appeared at trial for the appellant, Mr Rasmussen, opposed the Crown being permitted to adduce any evidence of the Catherine Field charges. In a written submission handed to her Honour, he argued: 
     
      
       
        
        “… 
         
         
        3. In this case [the appellant] submits that the Crown should not be permitted to adduce any evidence of the Catherine Field matters. 
         
         
        4. This Court has already ruled that the Catherine Field and Camden matters should not be run together in a joint indictment. 
         
         
        5. The Court has ruled that there is no tendency or coincidence upon which the Crown is entitled to rely as to the facts in each of the separate indictments. 
         
         
        6. The Court has already ruled that it does not support a circumstantial case (see the bases upon which the Crown advanced the argument on the joint indictment in his submissions). 
         
         
        7. The Court has already ruled against the Crown on the basis that supports state of mind (see the bases upon which the Crown advanced the argument on the joint indictment in his submissions). 
         
         
        8. There is no other valid reason advanced by the Crown for an entitlement to adduce irrelevant and prejudicial evidence. 
         
         
        9. To permit the Crown to re-litigate the Catherine Field matters in this trial directly contradicts this Court’s ruling that there would not be a joint trial [Rogers v R (1994) 181 CLR 251] … 
         
         
        11. It would also be productive of wasted time and resources for no purpose. It will extend the trial by at least 4 days possibly more (to estimate of 2 weeks) and will involve going into to detail of the matters that were raised in the previous trial – including challenging witnesses on evidence that they previously gave. 
         
         
        12. There are no directions that could be given to cure the prejudice that would arise from the joining of the Catherine Field and Camden matters for [the appellant]. 
         
         
        13. It will be a trial fraught with the danger of miscarriage … 
         
         
        15. It will be an abuse of the process of this Court by the Crown to permit the prosecution of a trial upon evidence that they were not permitted to run jointly and upon which a jury has found that there was no criminal activity for which he was to be found guilty.” 
        
       
      
    34 In oral submissions to the trial judge in support of these submissions, there was an exchange between her Honour and Mr Rasmussen in which Mr Rasmussen contended that if the Crown was entitled to adduce evidence that the appellant and co-offenders were at Catherine Field at about 8.00 pm on 24 November, the Crown would, in effect, be controverting her Honour’s “previous ruling”. This, apparently, was a reference to her Honour’s ruling that the Catherine Field charges and the Camden offences should not be heard together, because they did not relate to each other. Her Honour pointed out that in this trial (that is, of the Camden offences), she had not made any ruling about the admissibility of evidence that the three men were together on 24 November and that a conversation between them had been overheard. Her Honour stated that the Crown would be and would always have been entitled to have that evidence adduced in the trial.  
     
      
    35 Mr Rasmussen next pressed an argument that the evidence was irrelevant and submitted that it was not probative of any matter relating to the Camden offences. He then raised a further problem. He submitted that if the evidence was to be led of the three men being at the residence at Catherine Field and of Ms Plackett overhearing the conversation between the appellant and Mr Hynds, then Mr Hine and Ms Plackett were being asked to swear an entirely different version of events from that which they had already given on oath in the previous trial. Mr Rasmussen again submitted that if the evidence was admitted there would be a re-litigation of the Catherine Field charges.  
     
      
    36 Her Honour responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “Mr Rasmussen, I do not intend to have the Crown go into any evidence relating to what happened inside. My ruling would relate only to the fact that the three men were there together that night, they were in a motor vehicle which belonged to Pitman, and that [the appellant] was heard to say, ‘Let’s go to Camden.’”  
        
       
       
      Mr Rasmussen replied: 
       
       
        
        “How does your Honour expect me to properly challenge that piece of evidence?” 
        
       
      
    37 Her Honour said that he could challenge it, but Mr Rasmussen protested: 
     
      
       
        
        “And how? How can I go into – on the basis – if that’s what your Honour is intending to rule, how am I going to challenge the credit of Ms Plackett without going into the lies that she told the last jury?’ 
        
       
       
      Her Honour replied: 
       
       
        
        “I don’t know whether she did tell lies. I’d be very surprised about who did tell lies in that last hearing, but I wouldn’t sheet them home to Ms Plackett and Mr Hine. However, apart from that, what I’m saying is on my view of the material the Crown would be entitled to have those two matters before the jury as circumstantial evidence.” 
        
       
       
      The exchange continued: 
       
       
        
        “RASMUSSEN: How does your Honour propose to ensure that it’s encapsulated in that way? [The appellant] is entitled to challenge Ms Plackett’s evidence in any way that is a legitimate forensic purpose to invite the jury to disbelieve the fact that she claimed that she heard these things said. 
         
         
        HER HONOUR: You can cross-examine her on it and say that she’s lying about it.”  
        
       
      
    38 The matter proceeded to trial and Ms Plackett gave evidence in the terms outlined above. Mr Rasmussen cross-examined her to the effect that she might have been mistaken about having seen the men get into the car and in overhearing the conversation, because of the distraction caused by the baby crying. Mr Rasmussen did not put it squarely to Ms Plackett that her evidence was wrong.  
     
      
    39 The appellant submitted that in the first trial, Ms Plackett’s evidence conflicted in many respects with the evidence of the other Crown witnesses and that, if this evidence was admitted he was put at a significant disadvantage because it would have been ‘forensic suicide’ to raise before the jury matters relating to the Catherine Field charges.  
     
      
    40 In an affidavit read on the appeal, Mr Rasmussen said that it was an oversight on his part not to have put to Ms Plackett that the conversation she said she had overheard between the appellant and Mr Hynds had not taken place. Mr Rasmussen was cross-examined by the Crown, during which he was shown the transcript of his address to the jury. In that address he had said to the jury that he did not need to challenge Ms Plackett to the effect that she was lying. Rather, he pointed out to the jury that Ms Plackett’s attention was not completely on what she was listening to, as she was distracted by her baby. The implication he was asking the jury to draw was that her evidence was unreliable. This approach involved a tactical decision, appropriately made, not to challenge Ms Plackett’s credibility, but to challenge the reliability of her evidence.  
     
      
    41 In his written submissions on the appeal, the appellant submitted that he did not rely on any error or oversight by trial counsel but on the error of the judge in admitting the evidence at all. Accepting that submission, the purpose of having Mr Rasmussen give evidence on the appeal was, therefore, curious. No further reference was made to it in the oral submissions. Rather, the appellant contended that the challenge to her Honour’s ruling was that she had wrongly exercised her discretion under the Evidence Act 1995, s 135. That section provides:  
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        135 General discretion to exclude evidence 
         
         
        The court may refuse to admit evidence if its probative value is substantially outweighed by the danger that the evidence might:  
         
         
        (a) be unfairly prejudicial to a party, or 
         
        (b) be misleading or confusing, or 
         
        (c) cause or result in undue waste of time.” 
        
       
       
      Whilst no reference was made to s 135 at trial, the trial judge should be taken to be well acquainted with its terms. I should state, however, that it is not clear to me that the challenge to her Honour’s ruling was an erroneous exercise of discretion under s 135. No particular submissions were directed to the terms of the section. 
       
      
    42 In my opinion, there was no error in the trial judge’s ruling that the evidence of Ms Plackett in its sanitised form, was admissible. This is a process frequently permitted at trial where the evidence, if admitted in full, would be prejudicial. It must also be remembered that, contrary to the submission of counsel at trial, Ms Plackett was not being asked to swear an entirely different version of events from the version she gave at the trial of the Catherine Field charges. Rather, she was being asked only to give the evidence which was relevant to the Camden offences.  
     
      
    43 The correctness of her Honour’s ruling that the evidence was admissible can be tested in another way. Assume that the trial for the Catherine Field charges had not taken place before this trial. Evidence that only related to those charges would not be relevant evidence in respect of the Camden offences and undoubtedly would have been objected to on that basis. In that case, it would have been unnecessary to have recourse to the Evidence Act, s 135 and/or s 137. The only evidence relevant to the Camden offences was the conversation between the appellant and Mr Hynds and the men driving away in Mitchell Pitman’s car. The evidence of the assaults and the demands for money was only relevant to the Catherine Field charges. It is apparent, in my opinion, that her Honour’s ruling was that the evidence relevant to the Camden offences was admissible. That ruling was correct. 
     
      
    44 Alternatively, if her Honour was in fact exercising a discretion under s 135, it has not been demonstrated that there was an erroneous exercise of discretion by her Honour under that section. 
     
      
    45 Accordingly, I would reject ground 1 of the appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4  
       
      
    46 It is convenient to next deal with ground 4 of the appeal.  
     
      
       
      Ground 4: her Honour erred in law by failing to direct the jury that, in accordance with the decision of  
      Regina v Merritt 
       they should not convict unless they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the wallet allegedly found in the appellant’s bedroom was the wallet stolen from James Park during the course of the robbery and was indeed found in the room occupied by the appellant 
       
      
    47 As I have already indicated, the Crown case against the appellant was entirely circumstantial. There were at least the following seven components to that circumstantial case: 
     
      
       
      (1) The conversation between Mr Hynds and the appellant, to the effect, “ 
      Let’s go and see that guy in Camden 
      ” (of which Ms Plackett gave evidence); 
       
       
      (2) The accused was seen at Catherine Field in Mr Pittman's car, about four or five hours before the Camden events; 
       
       
      (3) The appellant was in the company of Mr Hynds and Mr Pittman at approximately 2 am at the home of Christine Hynds, Mr Hynds’ ex-wife, approximately five to ten minutes drive from the Camden premises;  
       
       
      (4) The description of the assailants generally matched the description of the appellant and his two co-offenders; 
       
       
      (5) The wallet identified by Mr Park as belonging to him was found in the bedroom occupied by the appellant; 
       
       
      (6) The appellant was seen walking with Mr Hynds away from the back paddock at the house in Cobbitty and when the police went to that spot they found two plastic bags, one containing Mr Guernier’s jacket and the other containing a number of mobile phones stolen from persons at the Camden premises; 
       
       
      (7) Two baseball bats were found in the room occupied by the appellant.  
       
      
    48 The appellant contended that the question whether a wallet was found in the appellant’s bedroom and whether it was Mr Park’s wallet, were indispensable intermediate facts and that the jury should have been directed that they had to be satisfied of each of those matters beyond a reasonable doubt. The trial judge gave no such direction. This submission sought to characterise each of these matters as independent ‘links in a chain’ to use the familiar terminology of Dawson J in Shepherd v R [1990] HCA 56; (1990) 170 CLR 573 (the Shepherd direction).  
     
      
    49 In Shepherd the directions required to be given to a jury in a circumstantial case were considered. Dawson J, at 579 and 585, explained the position in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “Circumstantial evidence is evidence of a basic fact or facts from which the jury is asked to infer a further fact or facts. It is traditionally contrasted with direct or testimonial evidence, which is the evidence of a person who witnessed the event sought to be proved. The inference which the jury may actually be asked to make in a case turning upon circumstantial evidence may simply be that of the guilt of the accused. However, in most, if not all, cases, that ultimate inference must be drawn from some intermediate factual conclusion, whether identified expressly or not. Proof of an intermediate fact will depend upon the evidence, usually a body of individual items of evidence, and it may itself be a matter of inference. More than one intermediate fact may be identifiable; indeed the number will depend to some extent upon how minutely the elements of the crime in question are dissected, bearing in mind that the ultimate burden which lies upon the prosecution is the proof of those elements. For example, with most crimes it is a necessary fact that the accused was present when the crime was committed. But it may be possible for a jury to conclude that the accused was guilty as a matter of inference beyond reasonable doubt from evidence of opportunity, capacity and motive without expressly identifying the intermediate fact that the accused was present when the crime was committed.  
         
         
        On the other hand, it may sometimes be necessary or desirable to identify those intermediate facts which constitute indispensable links in a chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt. Not every possible intermediate conclusion of fact will be of that character. 
         If it is appropriate to identify an intermediate fact as indispensable it may well be appropriate to tell the jury that that fact must be found beyond reasonable doubt before the ultimate inference can be drawn. But where - to use the metaphor referred to by Wigmore on Evidence, vol.9 (Chadbourn rev. 1981), par.2497, pp 412-414 - the evidence consists of strands in a cable rather than links in a chain, it will not be appropriate to give such a warning.  
        It should not be given in any event where it would be unnecessary or confusing to do so 
        . It will generally be sufficient to tell the jury that the guilt of the accused must be established beyond reasonable doubt and, where it is helpful to do so, to tell them that they must entertain such a doubt where any other inference consistent with innocence is reasonably open on the evidence. (at [4]-[5] 579) (emphases added) 
         
         
        … 
         
         
        Whether it is desirable for a trial judge to identify an intermediate conclusion of fact in his charge to the jury in order to instruct them that it must be proved beyond reasonable doubt will depend upon the particular case. Such an instruction will only be possible where the conclusion is a necessary link in a chain of reasoning. Even then, particularly when that is obvious, the instruction may not be helpful.” (at [14]-[15] 585) 
        
       
      
    50 Counsel for the appellant submitted (as had counsel at trial) that this case required a direction to the jury that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the wallet was found in the appellant’s bedroom and that it was Mr Park’s wallet. Reliance was placed on the approach taken in Merritt, where the Court (Wood CJ at CL, James and Adams JJ) said, at [70]: 
     
      
       
        
        “… In our opinion, where one or more facts might reasonably be regarded as intermediate facts,  
        it will usually be essential 
         for the trial judge to identify those facts and instruct the jury that if the jury considered that such facts were indispensable links in their chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt, they would need to be satisfied of them beyond reasonable doubt before convicting.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    51 In a number of cases since Merritt, the Court has sought to articulate the circumstances in which such a direction should be given: see, for example, R v Taylor (Court of Criminal Appeal, 18 April 1995, unreported); R v Zaiter [2004] NSWCCA 35; Minniti v R [2006] NSWCCA 30; 159 A Crim R 394; 196 FLR 431; and Davidson v R [2009] NSWCCA 150 discussed in Burrell v Regina [2009] NSWCCA 163 (Beazley JA, Grove and Howie JJ) at [90]-[96].  
     
      
    52 Importantly, in Davidson, Spigelman CJ, at [10], after referring to Merritt, said: 
     
      
       
        
        “[10] There is an element of redundancy in this analysis. If it be the case that a jury believes that particular facts are ‘indispensable links in their chain of reasoning towards an inference of guilt’ then it is unlikely that a jury could come to a conclusion that the offence was established beyond reasonable doubt unless that fact were so established. Indeed, that is so unlikely as to need no specific direction. The very hypothesis, that is, that the jury itself regarded a particular fact as an ‘indispensable link’ would prevent the jury convicting in view of the clear direction always given about the obligation of the Crown to prove guilt beyond reasonable doubt. There may be circumstances in which a jury needs to be informed of a matter that should be obvious, however, in my opinion the proposition in  
        Merritt 
         at [70] that it is ‘usually essential’ to give the direction therein referred to is not consistent with subsequent authority.” 
        
       
      
    53 Spigelman CJ then discussed the High Court decisions in Velevski v The Queen [2002] HCA 4; (2004) 76 ALJR 402; R v Hillier [2007] HCA 13; (2007) 228 CLR 618; and R v Keenan [2009] HCA 1; (2009) 83 ALJR 243, to which he had referred. See also the discussion in Burrell at [99]-[103]. Given the ample discussion of those authorities in Davidson and Burrell, I do not propose to re-analyse them here. It is sufficient to repeat the statement of Gummow, Hayne and Crennan JJ in Hillier, at [46] 637, that: 
     
      
       
        
        “… It is of critical importance to recognise, however, that in considering a circumstantial case, all of the circumstances established by the evidence are to be considered and weighed in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence” (citations omitted) 
        
       
       
      and the observation of Keifel J in  
      Keenan 
      , at [128] 435, that: 
       
       
        
        “The approach taken by [the trial judge in that case] is consistent with what was said in  
        R v Hillier 
        , namely that a circumstantial case is not to be considered piecemeal. It is of critical importance to recognise, in considering such a case, that ‘all of the circumstances established by the evidence are to be considered and weighed in deciding whether there is an inference consistent with innocence reasonably open on the evidence.’” (citations omitted)  
        
       
      
    54 Counsel for the appellant contended that the finding of the wallet under the appellant’s bed was effectively the only evidence that linked him directly with the offences. The finding of other items outside his room was not directly attributable to his involvement in the offences. Counsel for the appellant submitted, therefore, that the location of the wallet (said to be Mr Park’s) under the appellant’s bed was clearly the most critical piece of circumstantial evidence implicating the appellant in the offences. The appellant’s argument was that if the wallet found by police was not Mr Park’s wallet, the evidence of finding a brown wallet was irrelevant. If the wallet was not found in the appellant’s bedroom, the Crown would be unable to point to any circumstance which would make it more likely that the appellant had brought the wallet back to his bedroom at Cobbitty, rather than Mr Hynds having brought it back to the premises. He submitted, therefore, that because the evidence of the discovery of the wallet could potentially swamp any doubts the jury might have had about the Crown case, a Shepherd direction should have been given.  
     
      
    55 This submission suffers from the same erroneous premise as was identified in Velevski, at [44], namely, that a jury will consider the evidence in separate and isolated compartments. Although the finding of Mr Park’s wallet under the appellant’s bed was a strong piece of circumstantial evidence, it was not the only evidence that linked him with the commission of the offences. His involvement in the joint criminal enterprise was pointed to by each of the circumstantial matters identified in [47] above. They were entitled to accept or reject any aspect of the evidence, and to give such weight as they chose to any particular piece of evidence which they accepted. Having regard to the evidence the jury accepted and the weight attributed to any particular evidence, the jury was required to weigh up all of the circumstances and decide whether they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of the appellant’s guilt of the three offences with which he was charged. The trial judge, correctly, so directed the jury. 
     
      
    56 I would reject ground 4 of the appeal. 
     
      
       
      Ground 2: The trial miscarried when the trial judge criticised a submission made by the appellant’s counsel at trial to the jury without affording counsel the opportunity to address her Honour on the issue, despite the fact that counsel had indicated he wished to be heard on the Crown Prosecutor’s objections to his submissions. 
       
       
      Ground 3: The trial judge erred in failing to recuse herself and discharge the jury following the matter complained of in ground (2) 
       
      
    57 Grounds 2 and 3 are conveniently dealt with together and are properly considered having regard to my finding in respect of ground 4, namely that her Honour was not required to give a Shepherd direction.  
     
      
    58 The sequence of events at trial was as follows. After counsel for the appellant at trial had addressed the jury, the Crown Prosecutor, in the absence of the jury, complained to her Honour, inter alia, about Mr Rasmussen’s statement to the jury that they had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt as to the finding of the wallet. The following exchange then occurred between her Honour and counsel: 
     
      
       
        
        “CROWN PROSECUTOR: Two things in Mr Rasmussen’s address. He said that the jury should be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt-- 
         
         
        HER HONOUR: Yes I know, I was going to deal with all of that after I’ve finished these preliminary matters, because Mr Rasmussen seems to be referring to matters as though each link has to be indispensably proved beyond reasonable doubt, which is not the case. 
         
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: Yes your Honour. 
         
         
        HER HONOUR: Was there something else? 
         
         
        CROWN PROSECUTOR: No your Honour, just the finding of the wallet and the words spoken by Trudy Plackett, he said both of those incidents the Crown-- 
         
         
        HER HONOUR: Had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, yes which was not correct, I agree with that. It’s not a case – this is not a case which each … has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, just the cumulation of circumstances which doesn’t have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt. 
         
         
        RASMUSSEN: They’re part of the – they’re essential to the elements, that’s the point. They underpin it. 
         
         
        HER HONOUR: Look I don’t want to discuss this now, I want to get them in and they can deal with it.”  
        
       
      
    59 Her Honour then commenced summing up to the jury. In the course of the summing up, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “It has been suggested to you by Mr Rasmussen as to certain facts upon which the Crown relies, that is, in the circumstances or evidence which the Crown has pointed, that some of those matters must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. That is not the case, ladies and gentlemen. What must be proved beyond reasonable doubt are the elements that go to make up the charges. I will give you directions as to what has to be proved beyond reasonable doubt on Monday. I will go through each of the charges. I will tell you the elements relating to them, I will give you directions of law relating to how you approach circumstantial evidence, which the Crown relies upon in this case. I will also give you directions of law as to the principle of joint criminal enterprise, which has been referred to by the Crown and upon which the Crown also relies. And in referring to the elements which must be proved I will refer to some of the evidence which has been given by the witnesses. I will also refer shortly to what has been said to you in the addresses made on behalf of the Crown and on behalf of the accused. And of course I will also refer to what the defence has to say about each particular circumstance upon which the Crown relies. As I said, the only matters which have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt before you could return verdicts of guilty are the elements of each of these three charges on the indictment, copies of which you have.”  
        
       
      
    60 The summing up did not conclude that day and the matter was adjourned to Monday, 26 May 2008. At the commencement of proceedings that morning, trial counsel for the appellant made an application that her Honour recuse herself. He complained that, in her summing up to the jury, her Honour had criticised what he had said to the jury without having heard submissions from him as to whether this part of the address correctly stated the law. He said that he had understood from the exchange with her Honour, which had occurred just before her summing up, that he would be given an opportunity to be heard on the point. He then asserted this was a case which required a Shepherd direction and that he had intended to so address her Honour in response to the Crown’s complaint. 
     
      
    61 Counsel next asked her Honour to recuse herself on the basis that an independent and fair-minded observer would have a reasonable apprehension that she was biased. Counsel added: 
     
      
       
        
        “… particularly when it’s taken into account with what your Honour said at the end of the Catherine Field matters.”  
        
       
      
    62 Counsel again sought a Shepherd direction should her Honour not recuse herself.  
     
      
    63 The reference to the “Catherine Field matters” was a reference to a comment made by her Honour on 14 May 2008, after the appellant had been found not guilty of the Catherine Field charges. In refusing an application for bail for the period between the conclusion of that trial and the commencement of this trial, her Honour said: 
     
      
       
        
        “… I don’t think [the bail application] will be very successful. The matter will be proceeding on Monday. I’m not going to grant bail in the meantime.  
        [The appellant] was very fortunate, I think, with his jury. That was my view. 
         But in any event, these are serious matters that he will be standing trial for and it’s only a matter of some, what, five days time and he’ll be before the jury. He may well be walking away in another week or so but I’m not going to grant bail for that short period.” (emphasis added)  
        
       
      
    64 Counsel for the appellant submitted that the apprehension of bias apparent from her Honour’s failure to hear Mr Rasmussen on the correctness of his statement to the jury, was strengthened by these comments. As I understand it, this was a submission that it was apparent from her Honour’s comment that the appellant “was fortunate” before the jury in the first trial, that she had already formed an adverse view of the appellant.  
     
      
    65 The principles that govern an apprehended bias application are well-known. In Livesey v New South Wales Bar Association [1983] HCA 17; (1983) 151 CLR 288 at 293-294 the High Court said:  
     
      
       
        
        “[The] principle is that a judge should not sit to hear a case if in all the circumstances the parties or the public  
        might 
         entertain a reasonable apprehension that [the judge]  
        might 
         not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question involved in it.” (emphasis added) 
        
       
      
    66 This test was confirmed in Ebner v Official Trustee in Bankruptcy [2000] HCA 63; (2000) 205 CLR 337, where Gleeson CJ, McHugh, Gummow and Hayne JJ said, at [7] 345: 
     
      
       
        
        “The apprehension of bias principle may be thought to find its justification in the importance of the basic principle, that the tribunal be independent and impartial. So important is the principle that even the appearance of departure from it is prohibited lest the integrity of the judicial system be undermined. There are, however, some other aspects of the apprehension of bias principle which should be recognised. Deciding whether a judicial officer (or juror)  
        might 
         not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of a question that has not been determined requires no prediction about how the judge or juror will in fact approach the matter. The question is one of possibility (real and not remote), not probability. Similarly, if the matter has already been decided, the test is one which requires no conclusion about what factors  
        actually 
         influenced the outcome. No attempt need be made to inquire into the actual thought processes of the judge or juror.” 
        
       
      
    67 Relevantly, for the purposes of this case, their Honours said, at [8] 345: 
     
      
       
        
        “The apprehension of bias principle admits of the possibility of human frailty. Its application is as diverse as human frailty. Its application requires two steps. First, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge (or juror) to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. The second step is no less important. There must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits. The bare assertion that a judge (or juror) has an ‘interest’ in litigation, or an interest in a party to it, will be of no assistance until the nature of the interest, and the asserted connection with the possibility of departure from impartial decision making, is articulated. Only then can the reasonableness of the asserted apprehension of bias be assessed.” 
        
       
      
    68 See also Johnson v Johnson [2000] HCA 48; (2000) 201 CLR 488 at [11]-[14]. Relevant for present purposes is the statement in the plurality judgment, at [14], that a judge’s later statement withdrawing or qualifying remarks might remove a perception of bias. In Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design and Developments Pty Ltd Callinan J endorsed the appropriateness of having regard to the reasons for judgment and to read those reasons in conjunction with the transcript references which were said to found the apprehension of bias, to see whether the cumulative effect was one of apparent bias.  
     
      
    69 In Johnson v Johnson the Court also observed, at [12] 493, that the hypothetical observer is taken to be reasonable; and that the person being observed is “a professional judge whose training, tradition and oath or affirmation required [the judge] to discard the irrelevant, the immaterial and the prejudicial”. A like comment was made by Callinan J in Concrete Pty Ltd v Parramatta Design and Developments Pty Ltd, at [177] 635, where his Honour stated: 
     
      
       
        
        “It is axiomatic that the perception of a lay observer will not be as informed as the perception of a lawyer, particularly a litigation lawyer. But the notional lay person should not be taken to be completely unaware of the way in which cases are brought to trial and tried.” 
        
       
      
    70 Properly analysed, what happened in this case was that Mr Rasmussen had addressed the jury to the effect that a Shepherd direction was required. The Crown complained. Mr Rasmussen sought to maintain that the legal proposition he advanced was correct. However, her Honour wanted to commence her summing up to the jury, rather than keep the jury waiting. In the summing up, her Honour told the jury that what Mr Rasmussen had said was wrong and then directed them on the Crown’s circumstantial case. Mr Rasmussen did not accept that the trial judge’s direction to the jury was correct and he again raised the matter and contended that her Honour’s failure to hear him, when it was apparent that he wished to make further submissions on this issue, gave rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.  
     
      
    71 In Ebner it was said that two matters had to be established for a case of apprehended bias to be made out. First, the party alleging apprehended bias must identify what might lead a judge or juror to decide a case other than on its merits; and secondly, there must be an articulation of the logical connection between the matter and the feared deviation from a decision on the merits. 
     
      
    72 In this case, trial counsel had embarked upon an address to the jury which wrongly stated the law. Her Honour’s correction of that could not, on any reasonable view, give rise to an apprehension of bias. Rather, her Honour merely did what she was required to do in order to ensure that the jury was not left with a wrong understanding of the law. There was nothing in her comments to indicate that she might not bring an impartial or unprejudiced mind to her judicial task. Her Honour gave a correct direction, having stated in brief and uncontroversial terms that Mr Rasmussen’s statement of the law was not correct. Accordingly, the ‘first step’ identified in Ebner has not been demonstrated as having occurred. It follows that the need for the logical connection required by the second step does not arise.  
     
      
    73 As the required bases for establishing apprehended bias have not been made out, it is unnecessary to consider the comment made by her Honour on the bail application, which was relied upon by the appellant as supporting or strengthening the apprehension of bias.  
     
      
    74 The appellant submitted, alternatively, that in failing to hear Mr Rasmussen, her Honour failed to afford him procedural fairness. He relied upon the principles stated in Antoun v R [2006] HCA 2; (2006) 224 ALR 51. That case involved a trial before a judge alone. At an early stage of the proceedings, the defence indicated it would make a ‘no case to answer’ submission. The trial judge in that case responded: 
     
      
       
        
        “I see, well that application will be refused. So how long then will the defence case take?  
         
         
        Mr Steirn: How can your Honour possibly come to that view without having heard one word from either me or Mr Wilkinson?  
         
         
        His Honour: Because I've closed the Crown case, and I have just said it.  
         
         
        Mr Steirn: But you've heard not one word of any submission by either of us upon either the law or the fact.  
         
         
        His Honour: No, I'm simply telling you the application will be refused. I perceive what's in the Crown case, I perceive there's a case to answer. Whether it be answered or not is entirely for - - -  
         
         
        Mr Steirn: Might I ask your Honour to stay your Honour's judicial hand - - -  
         
         
        His Honour: All right - - -  
         
         
        Mr Steirn: - - - until such time - and please let me finish. Until such time as you've heard submissions by both defence counsel.  
         
         
        His Honour: Right, now when I've heard those submissions will you be in a position to proceed with the defence case?  
         
         
        Mr Steirn: Does that mean by that comment your Honour that your Honour has already considered the position without a word of submissions by - - -  
         
         
        His Honour: I'll consider any submission you put. I'm obliged to consider any position you put."" (at [68]) 
        
       
      
    75 The following morning the trial judge was asked to recuse himself having regard to the above exchange. His Honour refused the application, stating: 
     
      
       
        
        “I simply point out in relation to whatever application is about to be made in relation to a no case that I have a very, very firm view that as a matter of law, and I am after all in this tribunal not only the tribunal of fact but the tribunal of law, that as a matter of law an application for a no case cannot succeed in this particular trial.  
         
         
        I shall make that clear in the fullness of time, although I could make it clear now. I shall make it clear however at the conclusion of the submissions. 
         
         
        … an application of that description in my considered view on the law is doomed to failure.” (at [70]) 
        
       
      
    76 There was a further exchange in which his Honour was again asked to disqualify himself, having regard to his last-mentioned comments. His Honour refused the application and reiterated that a ‘no case to answer’ application could not succeed. Later in the trial his Honour, of his own motion, indicated that he proposed to revoke bail. 
     
      
    77 Callinan J, after referring to the test in Ebner, said, at [83]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It should be noted that the test as stated emphasises that a possibility, that is relevantly to say, the appearance of a possibility of an absence of an impartial mind on the part of the judge, may lead to disqualification. Their Honours also make it clear that the test does not involve, or require an inquiry into the facts or matters which brought the apprehended state of mind of the judge to one of apparent bias. It follows that the fact that the case may not only at the time, but also in retrospect, seem to be a strong one, indeed a very strong one, does not absolve the judge from giving it a fair hearing, and attending carefully and open-mindedly to the submissions of the parties made at appropriate times.” 
        
       
      
    78 His Honour concluded (as did other members of the Court) that a case of apprehended bias had been out. His Honour observed, at [85]-[86]: 
     
      
       
        
        “It seems to me that in this case the trial judge's conduct did present an appearance, indeed an unmistakable one, of prejudgment. As the passage from  
        Ebner 
         makes clear, when conduct of that kind occurs, it is not relevant to the inquiry as to whether an apprehension of bias has arisen that the strength of one party's case may have brought the judge to the point of making the remarks that he did.  
         
         
        It follows that the apparent strength of the respondent's case, and the weaknesses of the appellants' defence cannot be used as justification or excuse for the trial judge's expressions of a determination to reject submissions foreshadowed, but not yet made and developed.” 
        
       
      
    79 This case is not of that character. Counsel could have sought a Shepherd direction either before the commencement of the trial, before his or the Crown’s addresses, or during or after the summing up. In fact, he did seek such a direction, on Monday 26 May 2008. Having first asked her Honour to recuse herself, he sought alternatively that her Honour give a Shepherd direction. That matter was fully argued both by trial counsel and by the Crown prosecutor. Her Honour, correctly, rejected Mr Rasmussen’s submission that such a direction was required. There was thus no breach of procedural fairness in any event.  
     
      
    80 Grounds 2 and 3 should therefore be rejected.  
     
      
    81 Accordingly, I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    82 R S HULME J: In this matter I have had the advantage of reading the reasons for judgment of Beazley JA. I agree with those reasons and with the orders proposed by her Honour. I wish however to say something more concerning the second and third grounds relied on on behalf of the Applicant. Those grounds were:- 
     
      
       
        
        Ground 2: The trial miscarried when the trial judge criticised a submission made by the appellant’s counsel at trial to the jury without affording counsel the opportunity to address her Honour on the issue, despite the fact that counsel had indicated he wished to be heard on the Crown Prosecutor’s objections to his submissions. 
        
       
       
        
        Ground 3: The trial judge erred in failing to rescue herself and discharge the jury following the matter complained of in ground (2). 
        
       
      
    83 At the end of the Crown case, Mr Rasmussen sought a verdict by direction. In the course of his submissions he contended that the Crown case was one comparable to links in a chain rather than strands in a rope and that there was no sufficient evidence of some of the links. Her Honour dismissed the application saying:- 
     
      
       
        
        “Thank you very much Mr Rasmussen. I think the material before the jury should go to the jury, as there is no reason in my view to isolate each particular circumstance upon which the Crown relies to talk about its weakness or strength. It’s a matter where the jury must consider all of the evidence, not in isolation, but together and accordingly I refuse the application. …” 
        
       
      
    84 Mr Rasmussen then tendered a document that was admitted and closed the Defence case following which her Honour raised the issue of what directions she should given the jury. Mr Rasmussen raised one topic of no present relevance saying that that was the only one. On the following morning, Mr Rasmussen said that overnight he had given some thought to the directions that should be given, handed up another document apparently specifying a number of these and made some oral submissions. The document is now apparently lost but it would seem from the oral submissions that followed that nothing in the document related to the wallet or involved the proposition that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the wallet was found in the Appellant’s bedroom and that it was Mr Park’s wallet. That said, another of the submissions does seem to have involved the proposition that the jury had to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt of one aspect of the Crown case. Having indicated that she was not disposed to acquiesce in the submissions that were made, her Honour asked, “Was there anything other than that Mr Rasmussen that you wanted --?” Mr Rasmussen’s response is recorded as “Thank you your Honour”.  
     
      
    85 The Crown prosecutor then addressed the jury followed by Mr Rasmussen. Then events followed as set out in the reasons of Beazley JA at [58] et seq. The jury was obviously then brought in and her Honour commenced to sum up. The transcript records that at that time, a Friday, her Honour’s summing up occupied 9 pages. Her Honour completed her summing up on the Monday morning, the transcript of what she then said occupying some 44 pages. What was said on the Friday included instructions as to the burden and onus of proof, that the essential elements of the charges had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, and that what Mr Rasmussen had said to the effect that some of the circumstances and evidence had to be proved beyond reasonable doubt was wrong. 
     
      
    86 On the Monday morning Mr Rasmussen then made application that her Honour recuse herself. Against the possibility that her Honour would not do so, Mr Rasmussen then asked her Honour to direct the jury that what she had said on the Friday was incorrect, and that four particular facts relied on by the Crown and apparently referred to in the lost document were indispensable facts and must be proved beyond reasonable doubt. The transcript is not clear whether included in those four was the matter the subject of Ground 4 in this appeal but something along those lines was at least the subject of oral submission to the effect that the jury had to be satisfied of it beyond reasonable doubt. Mr Rasmussen developed his submissions over some 3 pages of transcript. After hearing briefly from the Crown her Honour indicated that she did not agree with the Mr Rasmussen’s contentions. 
     
      
    87 The substance of the submission made in support of Ground 2 was that it is a fundamental prerequisite of justice that a party be given a fair opportunity to put what they want to put, that Mr Rasmussen had indicated that he wanted to be heard on the topic and that her Honour deprived him of the opportunity.  
     
      
    88 The submission ignores the fact that the right to be heard does not include a right to be heard at any time of counsel’s choosing. Mr Rasmussen had, in her Honour’s opinion, misinformed the jury as to a matter of law. It seems clear that her Honour wished the jury not to be left with a mistaken impression for longer than necessary and particularly over the week-end. Her Honour was fairly entitled to afford more urgency to that view than hearing Mr Rasmussen’s argument.  
     
      
    89 The submission ignores the fact that that in ruling on Mr Rasmussen’s application for a verdict by direction her Honour had concluded that “It’s a matter where the jury must consider all of the evidence, not in isolation, but together …”. In substance, the proposition that Mr Rasmussen wished to advance contradicted her Honour’s conclusion and there are clear limits to the time a judge is obliged to expend in listening to arguments, or minor variation of arguments, the substance of which has already been rejected.  
     
      
    90 The submission also ignores the fact that Mr Rasmussen had earlier been invited to make submissions as to what the jury should be told and had not raised the topic that inspired his attempt to address her Honour shortly after he had concluded his address. Nor had he provided any advance warning of his intention to address the jury on what in fact a matter of law, viz. that they had to be satisfied of a particular matter beyond reasonable doubt, and this in circumstances where her Honour had expressed herself in the terms quoted above. 
     
      
    91 While the authorities recognise the desirability of any argument as to the content of a summing up occurring before it commences – R v Sandford (1994) 33 NSWLR 172 at 183 – or even before counsel address – R v Knight (unreported, NSWCCA, 18 December 1990), in many trials there will be no need for such argument.  
     
      
    92 Commonly of course, judges do invite or permit any issues that do arise to be raised and canvassed at a convenient time during a summing up. There is obvious advantage in covering topics once and not complicating a jury’s task by making and then withdrawing instructions or remarks and changing or supplementing them particularly at a time that may be far removed from when the original remarks the subject of any change or addition were first made. However, the fact that this is commonly done has not had the effect of turning a convenient practice into a right of counsel to interrupt a summing-up by raising and insisting on arguing an objection at a time of counsel’s choosing. in advance of the summing-up’s completion. 
     
      
    93 It is appropriate to bear in mind that a trial judge is under no obligation to provide advance notice to counsel as to what he or she proposes to say to the jury in the course of a summing up. Having heard what has been said, counsel have a right to ask for changes and make submissions as to why changes should be made but that right to argue such matters is to do so at the end of the summing-up or just prior to the jury being asked to consider its verdict.  
     
      
    94 In so stating the matter, I do not ignore remarks made in R v Lavery (1979) 20 SASR 430 at 436 that:- 
     
      
       
        
        “…, if something irregular occurs or is done during the hearing, or if, during the summing-up, counsel receives the impression that the jury could be misled on some matter of law or fact by what the trial judge is saying, it is his clear duty, at the first available and appropriate moment, to mention the cause of his misgivings, and to ask the judge to put right what, in his submission, has gone wrong.”  
        
       
      
    95 Given the obligation of defence counsel to his client I am by no means sure that this passage is entirely accurate but even if it is, it does not provide support for the view that the time for arguing the matter is a matter for the choice of counsel rather than the trial judge. 
     
      
    96 I turn to Ground 3, the principal argument in support of which was that a fair-minded bystander would have had a reasonable apprehension of bias arising from her Honour’s refusal to hear Mr Rasmussen when he wanted to address her.  
     
      
    97 A fair-minded observer is taken to know of all the relevant circumstances – see Vakauta v Kelly (1988) 13 NSWLR 502 at 528, 535-6. (In overruling this decision, the High Court made no criticism of this principle.) Attention cannot be confined to the one remark of her Honour and to that part of her summing-up as occurred on the Friday to the exclusion of her ruling quoted above, to the opportunities previously enjoyed by Mr Rasmussen to indicate what directions he sought, to his limited exercise of those opportunities, to the right he had at the end of the summing-up to seek further or different directions – a right he was in fact invited to exercise on the Monday morning - and to the importance of correcting prior to the weekend what her Honour saw as the erroneous advice as to the law that Mr Rasmussen had given the jury.  
     
      
    98 In light of these matters, it is simply absurd to suggest that, because her Honour chose not hear Mr Rasmussen at a time of his choosing, any fair-minded observer would thereby have derived a reasonable apprehension that her Honour was biased against his client. 
     
      
    99 Nor does the addition of the remarks her Honour made to the effect that “(The Applicant) was very fortunate, I think, with his jury (in his first trial). That was my view.” provide any further basis for a reasonable apprehension of bias. Any fair-minded observer would have thought it at least as likely, if not more likely, that in her Honour’s remark she was reflecting on the verdict in light of the evidence in that trial rather than indicating any personal view or bias against the Applicant. 
     
      
    100 LATHAM J: I agree with Beazley JA.

     SASTERAWAN v MORRIS 
     
     
      
     
     
     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 BASTEN JA: Pursuant to court attendance notices issued by the informant (Ms Morris) on 21 May 2004, the applicant (Mr Sasterawan) was charged with seeking to obtain a benefit through making or publishing a cabcharge document which had been altered, in contravention of s 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW). He was convicted in the Local Court and appealed to the District Court. His first appeal to that Court resulted in the convictions being confirmed, but that determination was set aside by the Court of Appeal exercising powers of judicial review. 
     
      
    2 On 29 June 2009, the matter having been remitted to the District Court for rehearing, the Chief Judge gave leave, pursuant to s 19 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001 (NSW) (“the Appeal and Review Act”) for the prosecution to recall the witnesses who had given evidence before the Local Court. That application was not opposed at the time, and the matter was listed for three days before Sweeney DCJ, commencing on Tuesday, 17 November 2009.  
     
      
    3 On the first day of the hearing, various preliminary matters were attended to. Two witnesses were called by the prosecution to establish that a key prosecution witness, Ms Elizabeth Kim, was currently residing in Korea. On the second day, again after some preliminary discussion, the informant was called to give evidence on a voir dire in relation to the conduct of an interview conducted with the applicant, in the course of which he had made admissions. In the course of her evidence, a concern arose as to the state of her health. The prosecution sought an adjournment. Counsel for the applicant opposed an adjournment “of more than a day or so”. Her Honour granted the adjournment and vacated the hearing of the matter. She directed that a new hearing date be fixed. The primary basis of the present application for leave to appeal challenged that order.  
     
      
    4 For reasons explained below, leave should be refused. The reasons include the absence of jurisdiction in this Court to consider the proposed appeal and the failure of the applicant to demonstrate an arguable basis for appellate intervention, supposing that the Court had jurisdiction. 
     
      
    5 The informant sought an order that the applicant pay her costs of the application to this Court. However, the Court has no power to make such an order in this case; further, if it did have power, no such order should be made. 
     
      
       
      Procedural history 
      
    6 The matter has a complex procedural history which may be summarised as follows. The charges related to cabcharge dockets provided to the applicant, then a licensed taxi driver, in June, July and October 2003. In each case the charge alleged that details completed on the docket by the applicant were false. The first matter involved the alteration of a fare from $6.15 to $136.15; the second, a fare altered from $7 to $70 and the third, a fare altered from $6 to $260. The applicant appeared before the Local Court on 29 March 2005, was convicted on each charge and fined $300 in respect of each offence. The applicant appealed to the District Court, pursuant to s 11(1) of the Appeal and Review Act. On 7 September 2005 his appeal was dismissed by Nicholson DCJ, pursuant to s 20(1)(b) of the Appeal and Review Act. 
     
      
    7 On 29 September 2005 the applicant filed a summons seeking leave to appeal to the Court of Appeal from the decision of the District Court. That application was misconceived. On 7 December 2005 a further summons was filed seeking judicial review pursuant to s 69 of the Supreme Court Act 1970 (NSW) of the decision in the District Court. Whilst those proceedings were still on foot, the applicant sought to have Nicholson DCJ state a case to this Court pursuant to s 5B(2) of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912 (NSW). 
     
      
    8 When the stated case was brought on for hearing in this Court, the summons for judicial review in the Court of Appeal was discontinued and was dismissed by consent. The questions raised on the stated case were answered adversely to the applicant: Sasterawan v Morris [2007] NSWCCA 185; 69 NSWLR 547. 
     
      
    9 Undaunted by the dismissal of the first summons for judicial review, on 27 July 2007 the applicant filed a further summons for judicial review seeking to have the decision in the District Court quashed. The Court granted that relief, holding that the reasons given by Nicholson DCJ were inadequate and constituted an error of law on the face of the record: Sasterawan v Morris [2008] NSWCA 70 at [50] (Tobias JA, Beazley JA and McClellan CJ at CL agreeing). A second, and apparently separate basis for setting aside the decision, was the failure of the primary judge to find that the applicant knew that each of the dockets was false in a material particular: at [62]. Thirdly, the Court concluded that the experienced primary judge had reversed the burden of proof: at [72]. 
     
      
    10 This application relates to the rehearing of the matter in the District Court. 
     
      
       
      Basis of application for leave to appeal 
      
    11 By notice filed on 16 December 2009 the applicant sought leave to appeal from a judgment or order identified as “grant of adjournment of hearing of appeal”. The judgment or order sought in place of that appealed against was “list appeal for hearing as soon as possible”. The sole ground identified was that the judge “should not have granted adjournment of hearing”. 
     
      
    12 At the time of lodging his application for leave to appeal, the applicant stated he was intending to apply for legal aid and appears not to have had legal representation. At some stage, not revealed in the evidence, the applicant obtained representation. On 18 February 2010 a solicitor acting for the applicant filed an amended application for leave to appeal. The order appealed against was again identified as the order of the District Court “to vacate the hearing and set the hearing down for hearing at another time”. The orders sought in lieu thereof were as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        1 Leave granted to the respondent to take evidence from Ms Kim be revoked. 
         
        2 Leave granted to the respondent to take evidence from Ms Morris be revoked. 
         
        3 Leave be granted to the appellant to put on affidavit evidence regarding: 
         
         
          
          (i) transcript of the proceedings in the District Court; and 
           
          (ii) history of the proceedings in the District Court since the matter was returned from the Court of Appeal (April 2008). 
          
         
        
       
       
      The first two orders sought related to the proceedings in the District Court; the third appears to have been sought for the purposes of the hearing in this Court. 
       
      
    13 By notice of motion dated 8 March 2010, the applicant’s solicitor sought leave to rely upon a second amended application for leave to appeal. This application, together with an affidavit in support, the transcript of the District Court hearings on 17 and 18 November 2009, the judgment of the District Court of the adjournment application and written submissions, were provided to the Court on the afternoon of 9 March 2010, namely the day before the hearing. 
     
      
    14 The second amended application identified the orders appealed against in the following terms: 
     
      
       
        
        “1 The Court’s order of 18/11/09 to vacate the hearing …; 
        
       
       
        
        2 The Court’s order 18/11/09 that Ms Kim be able to give evidence by audio visual link; 
        
       
       
        
        3 The Court’s order of 29/06/09 that leave be granted for the prosecution to call evidence from Miss E Kim.” 
        
       
      
    15 Each of these orders was sought to be vacated and a further order was sought that the appeal to the District Court be allowed “for reason of want of prosecution on the part of the [informant]”.  
     
      
      Extension of time 
      
    16 Pursuant to the rules, the applicant required an order of the Court extending the time within which to seek leave to appeal, the prescribed period being 14 days from the date of the judgment or order below: Criminal Appeal Rules, r 5B. That time expired on 2 December 2009. Putting other factors to one side, and with knowledge that neither the appeal nor the further hearing in the District Court would take place before the end of 2009, an extension of time until 16 December 2009, when the first application was filed, would not have been inappropriate.  
     
      
    17 The amended application however was not filed until two months after the vacation of the hearing and, whilst not expressly challenging them, sought orders which would have revoked orders made on 29 June 2009. Such an application for extension would fall within quite a different category.  
     
      
    18 Finally, there was the motion seeking an extension of time to permit consideration of the second amended application, lodged with the Court on 9 March 2010. The first order challenged was that identified in the first application. The second concerned an order made unopposed on 18 November 2009. The third identified an order made on 29 June 2009. Further consideration will need to be given to the extensions of time required in respect of the second and third orders. 
     
      
      Jurisdictional issues 
      
    19 Counsel for the applicant sought to identify the jurisdiction of the Court by reference, variously, to sub-ss 5F(1), (3) and (5) of the Criminal Appeal Act. These provisions read as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “ 
        5F Appeal against interlocutory judgment or order 
         
          
          (1) This section applies to:  
           
            
            (a) proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court … 
            
           
          … 
           
          (3) Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings:  
           
            
            (a) if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal … 
            
           
          … 
           
          (5) The Court of Criminal Appeal:  
           
            
            (a) may affirm or vacate the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against, and 
             
            (b) if it vacates the judgment, order, decision or ruling, may give or make some other judgment, order, decision or ruling instead of the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against.” 
            
           
          
         
        
       
      
    20 Neither of sub-ss (1) nor (5) provides the basis for an appeal. Indeed, in relation to sub-s (1), it might be thought surprising that s 5F applies at all to appeals in the District Court from convictions in a Local Court. Such proceedings would not ordinarily be understood as involving “the prosecution of offenders on indictment”. However, the term “indictment” is defined to include “any information presented or filed as provided by law for the prosecution of offenders”: Criminal Appeal Act, s 2(1). 
     
      
    21 There is a sense in which this definition reverses common usage, whereby an indictment is a sub-class of information: see, eg, Criminal Procedure Act 1986 (NSW), s 8 and John L Pty Ltd v Attorney-General (NSW) [1987] HCA 42; 163 CLR 508 at 516-517 (Mason CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ), discussing the concept of quashing an information, within s 5C of the Criminal Appeal Act, which deals with both informations and indictments, perhaps inconsistently with the definition of “indictment”. 
     
      
    22 It is sufficient to assume, without deciding, that an appeal to the District Court from a Local Court under Pt 3 (including s 11) of the Appeal and Review Act constitutes a proceeding “for the prosecution of offenders on indictment”. That is sufficient, because the applicant must fail in seeking to bring himself within sub-s 5F(3).  
     
      
    23 The reference in sub-s (3) to “any other party” is by way of contrast with sub-s (2), which confers rights on the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is now beyond question in this Court that the words “interlocutory judgment or order” in sub-s (3) are not to be construed by “an analysis based on a dictionary definition of each of the words”, but by reference to their substance and effect, within the statutory context and the general law principles applicable to a criminal trial: see R v Cheng [1999] NSWCCA 373; 48 NSWLR 616 at [32]-[34] (Spigelman CJ, Dunford and Kirby JJ agreeing) and R v Bozatsis & Spanakakis (1997) 97 A Crim R 296 at 303-304 (Gleeson CJ) referring to “the character and effect of the decision”. 
     
      
    24 In Cheng, the Crown had sought to avoid a directed acquittal by seeking to bring an interlocutory appeal against a ruling by the trial judge that there was no case to answer, in circumstances where there was no general right of appeal from an acquittal. The Court denied the availability of an interlocutory appeal in that circumstance. At the other end of the scale, rulings which are capable of revision and may not directly affect the outcome of the case, including evidentiary rulings, have been held not to fall within the terms of s 5F(3): see, eg, Steffan v R (1993) 30 NSWLR 633. In Steffan, the reasoning of the Court commenced with the proposition that a judgment is “the decision of a court which determines the proceedings (or an identifiable or separate part of them) and which is entered in the records of the court”: at p 636A. Further, an order is “a command by a court that something be done (or not done)”. 25 Reference has been made on occasion to the analogous approach to construction identified in the Commonwealth v Mullane [1961] HCA 28; 106 CLR 166, dealing with the jurisdiction of the High Court under s 73(ii) of the Constitution to hear appeals from “all judgments, decrees, orders and sentences …”. That case concerned the effect of a certificate provided by a Medical Board in respect of a claimant for workers’ compensation. The primary judge had ruled upon the effect of the certificate, giving reasons for considering that the certificate was not conclusive against the worker. The High Court (Dixon CJ, Kitto, Taylor, Menzies and Windeyer JJ) stated at 169: 
     
      
       
        
        “If the County Court had ruled against the employee who appealed to the County Court, the County Court might have dismissed that employee's appeal and that would have been an order. It might on the other hand have decided not then and there to dismiss his appeal but to hear more about it by way of explanation, or to enable another tribunal to pass judgment on the view which the learned judge adopted. What his Honour did was simply to give a ruling on a point of law which was raised. It did not conclude the rights of the parties before the hearing of the case was completed. The County Court judge might have altered his mind, he might have ruled otherwise, he might have qualified his ruling; there was no determination. It was something done in the course of the hearing. … It did not, in our opinion, amount to a judgment, still less to a decree; it did not amount to an order and certainly not to a sentence. It is outside the terms of s 73 of the Constitution and this appeal has no foundation in any curial order which is appealable.” 
        
       
      
    26 That decision was relied on in Bozatsis, at 303, and has also been relied upon to exclude appeals against rulings on the admissibility of evidence: see Lethlean (1995) 83 A Crim R 197 at 205-206 (Sheller JA, Allen and Hulme JJ agreeing). It has been said that whether a decision or ruling constitutes a “judgment or order” turns on whether there is an operative judicial act: Salter v Director of Public Prosecutions [2009] NSWCA 357 at [14] (Spigelman CJ, McColl and Campbell JJA agreeing), dealing with s 53(3) of the Appeal and Review Act. 
     
      
    27 The phrase “interlocutory judgment or order” is also to be found in s 101 of the Supreme Court Act, dealing with the subject matter of appeals to the Court of Appeal. Leave is required in relation to an appeal from an interlocutory judgment or order: s 101(2)(e). (The precursor to this provision was s 31(1)(i) of the Supreme Court of Judicature (Consolidation) Act 1925 (UK), which referred to appeals from “any interlocutory order or interlocutory judgment”.) Under that provision, rulings as to evidence given in the course of a trial, while concededly interlocutory, have been held not to give rise to a judgment or order which may be the subject of appeal: see Ampolex Ltd v Perpetual Trustee Company (Canberra) Ltd [1996] NSWCA 14 at p 3(5) (Mahoney P, Meagher JA agreeing); Rich v Australian Securities and Investments Commission [2005] NSWCA 233; 54 ACSR 365 at [19]-[25]. 28 Clearly, the term “judgment” in s 5F is not being used in its broadest colloquial sense to encompass all that might be included in the reasons given by a court for taking a particular course. No doubt the term “interlocutory” envisages a judgment or order which is less than the final determination of the proceedings, disposing of the rights of the parties. In civil jurisdiction, whether a judgment or order is interlocutory or final may depend upon looking either to the legal effect or to the practical effect of the order. Although the former approach is that adopted in construing s 101 of the Supreme Court Act, it does not follow that that approach is necessarily the sole approach appropriate with respect to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. Both approaches have been treated as relevant in this context where, as explained by Gleeson CJ in Bozatsis, it is “the character of the question, and the effect of the decision” that distinguishes a judgment or order from an incidental ruling made in the course of proceedings: 97 A Crim R at 303. Thus, an order staying proceedings may be appellable under s 5F, even though the basis of the order was, in effect, a ruling that evidence was or was not admissible. A ruling on evidence, standing alone, lacks finality; it may be varied in the course of the trial. However, once an order staying proceedings is made, the relevant element of finality is established. In the latter circumstance, the order may be challenged and, consequentially, any decision or ruling on which it was based. 
     
      
    29 Before leaving the question of statutory construction, it should be noted that the language of s 5F(5) extends beyond judgment and order and includes “decision or ruling”. That is because the scope of the appeal conferred, as of right, on the Attorney-General and the Director of Public Prosecutions extends to “any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence”, subject to a presently irrelevant limitation: s 5F(3A). The terms of sub-s (5) are clearly intended to pick up that extended operation of the right of appeal in circumstances which do not include a case such as the present, where the only right is to seek leave under sub-s (3). 
     
      
    30 While the precise scope and operation of s 5(3) may not be readily discernable from its terms, its application in practice will usually be clear. Relevantly for present purposes, it cannot operate with respect to an adjournment of proceedings, which does not constitute a stay, but is granted for the purpose of allowing the proceedings to continue at an appropriate time.  
     
      
    31 It remains to consider whether the section extends to an order permitting a witness to give evidence by audio visual link, or an order permitting the prosecution to call evidence from a particular witness, being an order pursuant to s 19 of the Appeal and Review Act. 
     
      
    32 There are two antecedent issues in relation to these orders, before any issue of jurisdiction arises. The first is whether the applicant should be permitted to rely upon the second amended application for leave to appeal provided to the Court on 8 March 2010; the second is whether any such direction or order was made, as alleged, on 18 November 2009. However, assuming they were resolved in favour of the applicant, there would nevertheless be no jurisdiction under s 5F. 
     
      
    33 Although not referred to by the parties, it appears to have been assumed by this Court in Alexandroaia (1995) 81 A Crim R 286 (Hunt CJ at CL, Grove and Dunford JJ) that an appeal would lie under s 5F in respect of the refusal by the trial judge of an adjournment, on the application of the accused. The jurisdictional issue may have been obscured by the fact that the trial judge granted leave to appeal under s 5F. However, the issue not having been addressed, the judgment is not authority for the proposition that such an appeal lies. 
     
      
    34 Once it is accepted, in accordance with authority such as Steffan, that no appeal can lie under s 5F from a ruling as to the admissibility of evidence, it must follow that a ruling as to the manner in which a witness can give evidence does not constitute an interlocutory judgment or order. 
     
      
    35 It is also unlikely that a direction that a person attend and give evidence, made pursuant to s 19 of the Appeal and Review Act, could constitute an interlocutory judgment or order. However, the proper characterisation of an order may depend upon the circumstances in which it is given. The orders made by the District Court under s 19 were made long before the present circumstances arose, namely on 29 June 2009. The orders were not opposed by the applicant. If circumstances have now changed (a suggestion which was not articulated in a comprehensible form before this Court) the proper course for the applicant was to seek to reopen those directions in the District Court. That was not done. The challenge in this respect having been raised expressly for the first time on 18 February 2010, by way of a proposed amendment, should not be permitted. Accordingly, leave should be refused to permit the amendment of the summons to include orders (1) and (2) identified in the amended application for leave to appeal referred to at [12]. Similarly leave should be refused to allow an amendment to include the third order identified in the second amended application, referred to at [14] above. In relation to orders (1) and (2) sought in the second amended application it is appropriate to grant an extension of time within which to challenge the additional orders, being identified as orders made on 18 November 2009, but reject leave to appeal, on the ground that neither falls within the scope of the Court’s jurisdiction under s 5F(3). 
     
      
       
      Merits: nature of appeal 
      
    36 The applicant approached the merit of his case by adopting the principles identified in House v The King [1936] HCA 40; 55 CLR 409 at 504-505 with respect to the exercise of a discretionary power, such as the imposition of a sentence. That approach has the support of this Court in Alexandroaia at 290. In R v BWM (1997) 91 A Crim R 260, Hunt CJ at CL suggested that appeal pursuant to s 5F was “not by way of rehearing”: at 267. Those remarks were not supported by Gleeson CJ nor Hidden J in BWM. The nature of the appeal has been further considered by this Court in Norvenska v Director of Public Prosecutions (Cth) [2007] NSWCCA 158 at [11]-[13]. It is not a matter which requires further consideration in this case. 
     
      
       
      Lack of merit of proposed appeal 
       
      (a) vacation of hearing 
      
    37 As explained by Schmidt J, the first order challenged, namely the vacation of the hearing and the adjournment to a date to be fixed, was comfortably within the scope of the discretionary power available to the trial judge and exercised by her. 
     
      
    38 Even if an appeal were available against the ‘orders’ made on 18 November 2009, this challenge would fail.  
     
      
      (b) manner of taking evidence 
      
    39 The second question concerns the order with respect to the taking of evidence from Ms Kim. After the adjournment was granted, counsel for the informant asked that her Honour make an order under s 5B of the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 (NSW): Tcpt, 18/11/09, p 50 (40). Counsel for the applicant did not oppose the application and her Honour ordered accordingly that Ms Kim be able to give evidence by audio visual link: p 51 (10). 
     
      
    40 Absence of objection will, at the very least, render an appeal against the making of an order or direction difficult. In this Court, counsel for the applicant argued that, once the matter had been adjourned, he had no basis for objection. In other words, the appeal against that order was entirely consequential on the appeal against the vacation of the hearing. The logic underlying that submission was obscure: Ms Kim was not present at the November hearing, because she was overseas, and her evidence would presumably have had to be taken by audio visual link at some stage in any event. Accordingly, assuming jurisdiction, leave to appeal against the order would be refused because the appeal could not be sustained on the merits. 
     
      
       
      (c) proposed dismissal of appeal in District Court 
      
    41 The ultimate purpose of the proceeding in this Court appears to have been to obtain an order that the appeal to the District Court be allowed, for want of prosecution by the informant. This proposed challenge was misconceived on a number of grounds. Apart from any other issue, no such point was agitated before Sweeney DCJ and her Honour did not make a ruling on such an application. Accordingly, there is nothing which resembles an interlocutory judgment or order from which leave to appeal could be sought. 
     
      
       
      Costs 
      
    42 The prosecutor sought an order for payment of her costs in this Court on the basis that the Court had an inherent or incidental power to make orders for payment of costs where proceedings were an abuse of the process of the Court. Reliance was placed on the decision of this Court in Markisic v Vizza [2002] NSWCCA 53. In that case, Stein JA (with whom Dowd and Barr JJ agreed) found that the appeal to the Court was incompetent: at [16]. The background involved an application in the Common Law Division, purportedly invoking the summary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court, to deal with offences, both under Commonwealth law and under State law. The trial judge had found the Court to be without jurisdiction to consider such complaints. On appeal, the respondents sought an order for payment of their costs, which gave rise to a question as to whether this Court had power to make such an order. It was common ground that, pursuant to s 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act, this Court had no power to award costs on the “hearing or determination of an appeal, or any proceedings preliminary or incidental thereto under this Act”. The Court in Markisic accepted that it had jurisdiction to determine whether its jurisdiction had properly been invoked. Its conclusion that the proceedings fell outside its jurisdiction meant, the Court held, that although “the proceedings purport to be brought under the Act, they in fact were not so brought”: at [31]. The proceedings not having been brought “under the Act” the prohibition in s 17(1) was held not to apply. The Court further concluded that, because it had implied power to control abuse of its processes, it also had implied (or inherent) power to order the applicants to pay the respondents’ costs: at [32]. 
     
      
    43 None of the authorities relied upon to support this conclusion dealt with the Criminal Appeal Act, nor did any deal with a statutory regime which contained an express prohibition on the award of costs to either side. Two cases, Darcey v Pre-Term Foundation Clinic [1983] 2 NSWLR 497 and R v Barbaro (1992) 106 FLR 387 each involved the costs of an application to set aside a subpoena which was shown to be an abuse of process. Each of the four authorities relied on involved a question of the power of the court making the order as to costs, but none supported the proposition that an application purportedly made in relation to a statutory jurisdiction, but found to fall outside the jurisdiction, was not an application “under” the relevant Act. 
     
      
    44 Indeed, the circumstances of the authorities support a contrary conclusion to that reached in Markisic. An application in this Court to set aside a subpoena as oppressive and an abuse of process, in respect of a pending appeal, would appear to involve proceedings preliminary or incidental to the appeal. The fact that the ground on which the subpoena might be set aside was described as “an abuse of process” would not take the matter outside the terms of s 17. 
     
      
    45 It is one thing to say that an administrative decision purportedly made under a statutory power, but tainted by jurisdictional error, is not a decision “under [the] Act” so as to obtain the protection of a privative clause – see Plaintiff S157/2002 v The Commonwealth [2003] HCA 2; 211 CLR 476 at [81] - it is quite another to say that an application purportedly invoking the jurisdiction of this Court under the Criminal Appeal Act, but which is held to fall outside the jurisdiction, does not involve “an appeal … under this Act”. 
     
      
    46 The Court was not taken to any case in which the principle in Markisic had been applied. By contrast, the analysis undertaken by Spigelman CJ (with whom Mason P, McClellan CJ at CL, Hidden and Howie JJ agreed) in R v JS (No 2) [2007] NSWCCA 309; 179 A Crim R 10 casts significant doubt on the scope, if not the legitimacy, of the principle. After referring to the fact that the Court is a statutory court, but has such “incidental statutory powers” as may, by implication, arise from the express conferral of jurisdiction upon and grant of powers to it (at [3]), the Chief Justice continued: 
     
      
       
        
        “[4] The Respondent submitted that, subject only to s 17 of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
        , … this Court’s power to award costs is ‘generally at large’. This submission should be rejected. It is necessary to identify an express or implied statutory power to make such an order.  
         
        [5] At a time when the powers conferred on this Court were to be found only in the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
        , this Court held that it ‘has no powers except those conferred upon it by that statute’. … Subsequently, other statutes have conferred powers on this Court. … The Respondent has failed to identify any relevant statutory provision. 
         
        [6] As part of its implied jurisdiction this Court has power to control abuse of its process and, as an incident of that power, may order a person who has abused that process to pay the other party’s costs, at least where s 17 of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act  
        does not apply. (See  
        Markisic  
        … at [31]-[33].) … 
         
        … 
         
        [16] The Respondent contends that the present case is not a proceeding ‘under this Act’ and, accordingly, s 17 has no direct application. This submission should be rejected. The words ‘under this Act’ appear within a distinct clause between the commas immediately before the word ‘or’ and after the word ‘Act’. As a matter of grammar the words ‘under this Act’ refer to the words ‘proceedings preliminary or incidental thereto’. … 
         
        [17] It may be the case that when the  
        Criminal Appeal Act 1912 
         was first enacted all appeals to this Court proceeded pursuant to that Act. However, the Act regulated the general procedure of this Court and is, generally, readily adaptable to the conferral of appeal rights to this Court under other legislation. The reference to ‘an appeal’ does not, as a matter of textual analysis, need to be restricted to an appeal solely under the  
        Criminal Appeal Act  
        itself and should not be. The procedural provisions of the Act, including s 17, should be applied to any scheme pursuant to which appeals are brought to this Court. (As distinct from proceedings which cannot be called an appeal at all, as in  
        Markisic  
        ….)” 
        
       
      
    47 If Markisic has any vitality, it has no application in the present case. The case has turned upon the scope of an interlocutory appeal under s 5F(3), by construction of the phrase “interlocutory judgment or order”. The application before the Court is an application for leave to appeal pursuant to that provision. It is an application under the Criminal Appeal Act, whether it be successful or not. The fact that it has proved unsuccessful because of the proper construction of the Act does not mean that the application was not brought under the Act, nor that the proceedings which have been held to determine whether or not leave should be granted are not proceedings preliminary to or incidental to the proposed appeal. The rejection of leave has taken place in the exercise by the Court of its implied jurisdiction to determine whether it has jurisdiction. That is the exercise of a jurisdiction conferred (by implication) by the Act. The application which sought to invoke that jurisdiction is an application under the Act. Therefore the prohibition in s 17 operates and no order for costs can be allowed to the successful party. 
     
      
       
      Orders 
      
    48 The following orders should be made: 
     
      
       
      (1) Extend time within which to seek leave to appeal, limited to the following orders made on 18 November 2009 – 
       
       
        
        (a) “the hearing is vacated and a new hearing date is to be fixed”; and 
        
       
       
        
        (b) “that Ms Kim be able to give evidence by audio visual link”. 
        
       
       
      (2) Otherwise dismiss the motion for an extension of time. 
      
     
     
      
      (3) Refuse leave to appeal under s 5F(3) of the  
      Criminal Appeal Act 
      . 
       
       
      (4) Refuse the respondent’s application for an order for costs of the proceedings in this Court. 
       
       
      
    49 RS HULME J: The circumstances that have led to the proceedings in this Court are set out by Basten JA and Schmidt J and I need not repeat them. 
     
      
    50 Having had time to reflect on this matter, my preferred view is that the Court should refuse the extensions of time sought, applications to file amended documents and leave to appeal upon the ground that the substantive orders sought to be set aside were not opposed, or so obviously within the proper exercise of the judges who made them, or both, that any challenge to those orders is futile. The passage of time is another ground for concluding that the challenge to the order made on 18 November 2009 adjourning the proceedings is futile. 
     
      
    51 The order sought that the proceedings be dismissed for want of prosecution was not sought in the District Court so it could be made by this Court only if the Applicant succeeded in successfully challenging the orders made below. Hence this prayer is also doomed to failure. 
     
      
    52 These conclusions make it unnecessary for me to pursue many of the matters referred to in the reasons for judgment of my siblings. However I agree with both of them that no order for costs can be made. 
     
      
    53 For a variety of reasons, not the least of which was that many of the documents relied on by the Appellant were filed and served on the afternoon before the hearing in this Court – after the Respondent’s submissions were filed - the hearing in this Court on 10 March last proceeded in a somewhat disorganised fashion. There were no orders extending time or allowing the Applicant to file documents but at the conclusion of argument for the Appellant on the issues other than costs, Basten JA observed:- 
     
      
       
        
         
        “The court need not trouble you, Mr Bodor (counsel for the Respondent). It intends to refuse leave to appeal in this matter. We will reserve our decision.” 
        
       
      
    54 It seems to me that implicit in that observation is that the Court would grant any necessary extensions of time sought and permit the Notice of Motion of 8 March 2010 and the Second Amended Application for Leave to Appeal to be filed. In these circumstances it seems to me that the orders proposed by Schmidt J best meet the situation. I agree with them.  
     
      
    55 SCHMIDT J: By a notice filed on 16 December 2009 pursuant to s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act 1912, the applicant sought leave to appeal Sweeney DCJ’s grant of an adjournment of the District Court’s hearing of an appeal from his conviction in the Local Court of offences under s 178BB of the Crimes Act 1900. That notice was later sought to be amended by a document filed in February 2010, by which the applicant also sought leave to appeal decisions earlier reached by Chief Judge Blanch in the District Court pursuant to s 19 of the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act 2001, granting the respondent leave to call evidence from a Ms Morris and a Ms Kim. The application for leave to appeal was finally sought to be pressed pursuant to a second amended application for leave to appeal, by which the applicant sought orders that: 
     
      
       
        
         
        1 The Court's order of 18/11/09, that the hearing be vacated, be vacated 
         
         
        2 The Court's order of 18/11/09, that leave be granted to the Respondent to take evidence from Ms Kim by video link, be vacated 
         
         
        3 The Court's order of 29/06/09, that leave be granted to the Respondent to call evidence from Ms Kim, be vacated 
         
         
        5 The appeal to the District Court be allowed, in respect of each or all of the three charges, for reason of want of prosecution on the part of the Respondent 
         
         
        6 Leave be granted to the Applicant to put on affidavit evidence regarding: 
         
          
         (i) transcript of the proceedings in the District Court; and 
          
          
         (ii) history of the proceedings in the District Court since the matter was returned from the Court of Appeal (April 2008) 
         
         
        7 Costs 
         
        
       
      
    56 The respondent did not oppose leave to amend the application for leave to appeal being granted, but in written submissions filed before the applicant's submissions were filed, submitted that the Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the appeal and that the appeal should thus be dismissed with an order for costs. Having heard the applicant the Court was satisfied that the leave sought had to be refused and did not call on the respondent, other than as to costs.  
     
      
    57 There is a substantial background to these proceedings, conveniently explained by Tobias JA in Sasterawan v Morris [2008] NSWCA 70: 
     
      
       
        
         
        2 On 10 March 2004 the first opponent, Ms Judith Morris (the Prosecutor) issued a Court Attendance Notice (the Notice) returnable before the Local Court at Parramatta on 21 May 2004. The Notice alleged that on three occasions in 2003 Mr Sasterawan, the claimant, altered a Cabcharge docket with intent to obtain a financial advantage contrary to the provisions of s 178BB of the  
        Crimes Act  
        1900 (NSW). The charges were heard in the Local Court on 29 March 2005 when the claimant was convicted on each charge and fined $300 in respect of each offence.  
         
         
        3 On 7 April 2005 the claimant appealed to the District Court against his conviction in the Local Court pursuant to s 11 of the  
        Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act  
        2001 (NSW) (the  
        Review Act 
        ). Nicholson DCJ (the primary judge) dismissed that appeal pursuant to s 20(1)(b) of that Act on 7 September 2005.  
         
         
        4 The claimant ultimately issued a summons in this Court seeking relief pursuant to ss 69(1) and (3) of the  
        Supreme Court Act  
        1970 (the  
        SC Act 
        ) 
          
        by way of an order quashing the decision of the primary judge on the grounds of jurisdictional error and error of law appearing on the face of the record. It is that summons with which the Court is now concerned.  
         
          
           
          The steps taken by the claimant after the decision of the primary judge 
          
         
         
        5 Acting for himself and without the benefit of legal advice, on 29 September 2005 the claimant filed in the Court of Appeal a summons for leave to appeal from the decision of the primary judge. That application was misconceived, there being no right of appeal, with or without leave, to this Court from his Honour’s decision under the  
        Review Act 
        . Upon appreciating that error, on 7 December 2005 the claimant filed in this Court a further summons seeking relief in the nature of certiorari 
          
        pursuant to s 69 of the  
        SC Act  
        (the first s 69 summons). An amended summons was filed on 18 April 2006 (the amended first s 69 summons).  
         
         
        6 As a consequence of obtaining legal advice the claimant, prior to any hearing of the amended first s 69 summons, requested the primary judge to state a case to the Court of Criminal Appeal pursuant to s 5B(2) of the  
        Criminal Appeal Act  
        1912 (the  
        CA Act 
        ). On 16 March 2007, three questions of law were stated for the opinion of that Court, which ultimately answered them contrary to the submissions of the claimant on 28 June 2007:  
        Sasterawan v Morris  
        [2007] NSWCCA 185.  
         
         
        7 When the matter came before the Court of Criminal Appeal it was necessary for the claimant to obtain an extension of time within which to submit the questions of law raised by the stated case as s 5B(2) of the  
        CA Act  
        required that such questions of law be submitted not later than 28 days after the end of the appeal proceedings in the District Court.  
         
         
        8 At this stage, the Court had not disposed of the claimant’s amended first s 69 summons. It is recorded by Basten JA, with whom Grove and Hidden JJ agreed, in his judgment in the Court of Criminal Appeal (at [9]) that at the commencement of oral argument before that Court, counsel for the claimant handed up a Notice of Discontinuance relating to the proceedings in the Court of Appeal. His Honour then dismissed the amended first s 69 summons in exercise of his power as a single judge of appeal under s 46 of the  
        SC Act 
        .  
         
         
        9 As I have indicated, the Court of Criminal Appeal rejected the submissions of the claimant, with the result that the decision of the primary judge stood.  
         
         
        10 On 27 July 2007 the claimant filed a further summons in this Court pursuant to s 69 of the  
        SC Act  
        that was first amended on 8 October 2007 and further amended on 5 December 2007 (the second s 69 summons). Although a third amended summons was filed, the claimant relied only on his second amended summons before this Court. It relevantly sought the following orders:  
         
          
          · that the time for the filing of the summons be extended to 27 July 2007 pursuant to Pt 51 r 5 of the  
          Supreme Court Rules 
          ;  
          · that the judgment of the District Court be sent up to the Court of Appeal to be quashed.  
          · that the matter be remitted to the District Court for rehearing.  
          
         
         
        11 However, an extension of time was not required for the filing of the second s 69 summons as such a summons is an originating process in respect of which there is no relevant statutory time limit within which it must be filed. Of course, any question of delay in seeking relief under s 69 will be relevant to the exercise by the Court of its discretion to grant such relief, where grounds have otherwise been demonstrated. 
         
        
       
      
    58 The Court of Appeal concluded that errors of law by the primary judge on the face of the record had been established; that the orders made in the District Court proceedings on 7 September 2005 should thus be quashed and the proceedings remitted to the District Court for rehearing. 
     
      
       
      The adjournment of the District Court hearing 
       
      
    59 The matter was listed for hearing for 3 days. It commenced before Sweeney DCJ on 17 November 2009. On 18 November a prosecution witness became unwell and on the application of the respondent, the hearing was vacated, over the applicant's objection. The matter was listed for mention on 27 November, so that a new hearing date could be fixed. 
     
      
    60 From the respondent’s submissions it appears that there was no appearance for the applicant that day. The further hearing was then fixed for 22 February 2010. The applicant later sought to have that date vacated on the basis that his solicitor had forgotten to attend the mention on 27 November and that the February date was not convenient to his counsel. The further hearing is now fixed for 10 May 2010. 
     
      
    61 The applicant’s complaint was that Sweeney DCJ acceded to the adjournment application made after the respondent’s counsel conferred with the witness and advised the Court that she did not reside in Sydney; that her doctor also did not live in Sydney; and that it generally took her a few days to get an appointment. In those circumstances, the applicant opposed an adjournment of more than a day or so. Her Honour adjourned the proceedings to a date to be fixed, concluding that the interests of justice required the adjournment ‘and not for one day, because Ms Morris, as I understand it, simply cannot get an appointment within that time and that would not achieve anything.’  
     
      
    62 This, it was argued for the applicant, involved the Court dealing with the application in circumstances where there was no evidence before the Court as to the relevant matters and where the Court had mistaken the critical facts. In those circumstances the leave sought would be granted and the order made vacated. The futility of the order sought in relation to the vacation of the hearing was acknowledged, but nevertheless still pressed. 
     
      
       
      The evidence of Ms Kim and the final disposition of the appeal 
       
      
    63 It was explained for the applicant that the crux of the appeal related to the respondent being granted leave to call evidence from Ms Kim by way of video link. She was a crucial witness who had been subpoenaed to give evidence by the respondent, but adequate arrangements for her presence at the hearing had not been made. Before the trial she had moved overseas. In the circumstances of the adjournment of the hearing, the applicant did not oppose the respondent’s application to call evidence from Ms Kim by video link.  
     
      
    64 It was nevertheless the applicant’s case on appeal that the result of the District Court improperly exercising its discretion to adjourn the hearing indefinitely was manifest unfairness. This permitted the respondent to call Ms Kim’s evidence by video link. If the adjournment had been only for a day or so, the respondent would not have had the opportunity to call such evidence from Ms Kim.  
     
      
    65 In those circumstances the orders sought in respect of Ms Kim would be made, as well as an order that the applicant’s appeal to the District Court be allowed, thereby finally determining the proceedings in that Court in favour of the applicant. 
     
      
       
      Leave to appeal refused  
       
      
    66 Section 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act provides: 
     
      
       
        
        5F Appeal against interlocutory judgment or order 
        (1) This section applies to:  
         
          
          (a) proceedings (including committal proceedings) for the prosecution of offenders on indictment in the Supreme Court or in the District Court, and 
          (b) proceedings under Division 5 of Part 2 of Chapter 3 of the Criminal Procedure Act 1986, and 
          (c) proceedings in Class 5 of the Land and Environment Court’s jurisdiction (as referred to in section 21 of the Land and Environment Court Act 1979). 
          
         
        (2) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in proceedings to which this section applies. 
        (3) Any other party to proceedings to which this section applies may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against an interlocutory judgment or order given or made in the proceedings:  
         
          
          (a) if the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to appeal, or 
          (b) if the judge or magistrate of the court of trial certifies that the judgment or order is a proper one for determination on appeal. 
          
         
        (3A) The Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions may appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence, but only if the decision or ruling eliminates or substantially weakens the prosecution’s case. 
        (4) An appeal under this section shall, unless the Court of Criminal Appeal gives leave to adduce fresh, additional or substituted evidence, be determined on the evidence (if any) given in the proceedings to which the appeal relates. 
        (5) The Court of Criminal Appeal:  
         
          
          (a) may affirm or vacate the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against, and 
          (b) if it vacates the judgment, order, decision or ruling, may give or make some other judgment, order, decision or ruling instead of the judgment, order, decision or ruling appealed against. 
          
         
        (6) If leave to appeal under this section is refused by the Court of Criminal Appeal, the refusal does not preclude any other appeal following a conviction on the matter to which the refused application for leave to appeal related. 
         
         
        (7) A person may not appeal to the Court of Criminal Appeal under this section against an interlocutory judgment or order if the person has instituted an appeal against the interlocutory judgment or order to the Supreme Court under Part 5 of the  
        Crimes (Local Courts Appeal and Review) Act 2001 
        . 
        
       
      
    67 As was acknowledged for the applicant, the order sought in these proceedings in respect of the adjournment of the hearing in the District Court was plainly futile. It is an order which this Court would not contemplate making. In Alexandroaia v R (1995) 81 A Crim R 286 the Court had to consider an appeal brought under s 5F by a defendant whose adjournment application had been refused. The appeal was refused, without the question of leave being considered, the Court observing at 290: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Whether or not an adjournment should be granted is a matter which lies within the discretion of the trial judge. ( 
        Conroy v Conroy 
         (1917) 17 SR 680 at 682) An appeal based upon the judge's refusal to grant an adjournment is thus one against the exercise of a discretion, and it will be allowed only where it has been established that the judge has erred in the proper exercise of that discretion. (Ibid (at 684);  
        Collier-Garland (Properties) Pty Ltd v Northern Transport Co Pty Ltd 
         (1964) 82 WN (Pt1) 125 at 127). 
         
        There is a strong presumption in favour of the correctness of the decision, but that presumption will be overcome where it is shown that the judge has acted on some wrong principle, or has given weight to extraneous or irrelevant matters, or has failed to give weight or sufficient weight to relevant considerations, or has made a mistake as to the facts. Even if the precise nature of the error may not be discoverable, it is sufficient that the result was so unreasonable or plainly unjust that the appellate court may infer that there has been a failure properly to exercise that discretion. ( 
        House v The King 
         (1936) S5 CLR 499 at 504-505; Lovell v Lovell (1950) 81 CLR 573 at 532-534; Rodgers v Rodgers (1964) 114 CLR 608 at 619-620) An appellate court may not, however, substitute its own findings of fact for those of the primary judge unless there was no evidence to support a particular finding, or the evidence is all one way or the judge has misdirected himself in relation to those facts. ( 
        Regina v O'Donoghue 
         (1988) 34 ACrimR 397 at 401) If the appellate court is satisfied that there has been an injustice to one of the parties as a result of the judge's exercise of discretion, it is under a duty to review the order made. (

         [1928] 1 KB 645 at 653;

    68 In this case no error was shown. Her Honour was entitled to proceed on the basis of the position put to her for the respondent about the witnesses’ situation, without objection from the applicant. There was no complaint made that the respondent ought to have led evidence as to the matters advised in relation to the witnesses’ residence, that of her doctor and that it would take her some days to obtain an appointment. It is too late to advance the complaint now sought to be made on appeal in relation to this issue. 
     
      
    69 Even if her Honour’s view of the facts had been mistaken, that would not necessarily result in leave being granted. In R v Matovski (1989) 15 NSWLR 720 at 723 Gleeson CJ, with whom Lee CJ at CL and Grove J agreed, observed that :  
     
      
       
        
         
        For my part it seems to me that the reasons for the learned judge disclose no error of principle, assuming the view of the facts which he took to be correct. It has not been suggested that the view which the learned trial judge took of the facts is not one that was possibly open to him, the submission is simply that his Honour got the facts wrong.  
         
         
        I would not suggest that there may not be cases in which substantial factual error could form the basis of a successful application for leave to appeal under s 5F. I do not intend to suggest that the only cases in which this Court would give leave to appeal would be cases where the applicant can point to some error of law or mistake in principle concerning the way in which a discretion of the kind involved in an application such as that presently in question should be exercised. No doubt there may always be cases where the interests of justice would require the granting of leave to appeal even in the absence of some specific error of the kind to which reference has already been made. Accordingly, it is not appropriate to circumscribe the discretion which this Court has in deciding whether to grant or withhold leave to appeal. Equally, however, it is necessary to attend to the statutory requirement that leave be granted where an appeal against an interlocutory judgment is contemplated by a party to proceedings other than one of the persons mentioned in s 5F(2). The present case is not in my view one in which leave to appeal should be granted. I can see no error of law or discretionary principle in the reasons for judgment of the learned trial judge. He took a particular view of the facts after hearing detailed evidence and argument and it seems to be a view of the facts which was at least open to him. The case is not one in which in my view the interests of justice require intervention by this Court at this stage and I would propose that the application for leave to appeal be dismissed. 
        
       
      
    70 In this case the complaint is not factual error, but an absence of evidence as to those facts. In the circumstances there can be no question that the conclusion reached as to the adjournment was well within her Honour’s discretion. Her Honour was entitled to reject the position urged for the applicant in determining what justice demanded in the situation which had presented itself.  
     
      
    71 As to the leave sought in relation to Ms Kim’s evidence, as it was explained for the applicant, this hinged on the success of the appeal in respect of the adjournment. No case for granting leave to appeal from the decision of Chief Judge Blanch was pressed on any basis other than the consequences, in the particular circumstances, of the adjournment having been granted by Sweeney J. That, as a matter of justice between the parties, cannot be a proper basis for granting the applicant leave to appeal his Honour’s decision to grant the respondent leave to call evidence from Ms Kim on the hearing of the appeal from the Local Court. 
     
      
    72 As to the leave granted to call Ms Kim’s evidence by use of video link, it may not be overlooked that s 5F(3) of the Criminal Appeal Act confines the leave which the applicant might seek of this Court to ‘interlocutory judgments or orders’ of the District Court. The section does not permit an appeal to this Court in relation to procedural rulings or directions made during the course of a hearing, such as that involved in permitting Ms Kim to give her evidence by video link. Under the Evidence (Audio and Audio Visual Links) Act 1998 that was a matter for the District Court’s directions in the particular circumstances of the case before it. That direction is not amenable to review under s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. 
     
      
    73 While s 5F(5) of the Criminal Appeal Act refers to the Court’s powers in respect of a ‘decision or ruling’, that is a reference to the provision made in s 5F(3A), which gives the Attorney General or the Director of Public Prosecutions the right to appeal against any decision or ruling on the admissibility of evidence. The applicant is given no such right under s 5F(3), much less a right to seek leave to appeal in respect of a direction as to the manner by which particular evidence is to be received.  
     
      
    74 Finally, it was argued that the order sought finally disposing of the proceedings was available to be made under s 5F(5) of the Criminal Appeal Act. It is doubtful that the section envisaged such relief being granted in circumstances where there is no judgment or order of the District Court, which is sought to be made the subject of an appeal. The practical result of the order would be to uphold the appeal, without a hearing on the merits by way of rehearing by the District Court, as envisaged by the Crimes (Appeal and Review) Act. That does not appear to be an order contemplated by s 5F of the Criminal Appeal Act. Given however, that such an order would plainly only be entertained if the applicant succeeded in obtaining the orders sought in respect of the adjournment and Ms Kim’s evidence, it is unnecessary to consider this question further. 
     
      
       
      Costs 
       
      
    75 Section 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act relevantly provides: 
     
      
       
        
        17 Costs of appeal 
        (1) On the hearing or determination of an appeal, or any proceedings preliminary or incidental thereto under this Act, no costs shall be allowed on either side. 
        
       
      
    76 The respondent’s case was that the applicant was not exercising any right of appeal provided by the Criminal Appeal Act and that accordingly, s 17 did not govern the question of costs. The respondent argued that the appeal should have been brought by way of stated case under s 5B, in which event costs could have been awarded (see Robinson v Woolworths Ltd [2005] NSWCCA 426; [2005] 227 ALR 353 at [55] per Basten JA (with whom Barr J and Hall J agreed).  
     
      
    77 The respondent sought an order for costs against the applicant, relying on the power to award costs discussed in Markisic and Anor v Vizza and 16 Ors [2002] NSWCCA 53. There the respondent made plain to the applicant that the Court of Criminal Appeal did not have any jurisdiction to entertain his appeal and that costs would be sought against him. Still he persisted. The Court found that it had no jurisdiction, because the applicant had no right to bring the proceedings at all and a costs order was made against him. It was observed by Stein JA with whom Dowd and Barr JJ agreed: 
     
      
       
        
         
        28 In their written submissions the respondents’ seek costs of the proceeding before the Court of Criminal Appeal. Section 17 of the Act provides that no costs shall be allowed on either side on the hearing or determination of an appeal, but this does not mean that the Court of Criminal Appeal has no jurisdiction to make orders for costs, see, for example, cases stated under s 5B.  
         
         
        29 In  
        Proust v Blake  
        (1989) 17 NSWLR 267 Samuels JA stated [at 272]:  
         
         
          
          It is clear law that the fact that a court has no jurisdiction to determine a matter does not prevent it from dealing with the costs of the proceedings in which its absence of jurisdiction is established:  
          Pezet v Pezet  
          (1946) 47 SR (NSW) 45 at 51; 63 WN (NSW) 238 at 240. This case was disapproved in  
          Miller v Teale  
          (1954) 92 CLR 406 but not in relation to the costs point. It follows that even if the result of this court’s determination was to declare that it had no jurisdiction to entertain the stated case (which it is not) there would still be jurisdiction to make an order for the costs of the proceedings which we have heard. 
          
         
         
        30 Where a court has no jurisdiction to determine a matter sought to be litigated before it, it still has jurisdiction to determine whether it has jurisdiction and, therefore, a jurisdiction to deal with the costs of the proceedings, see authorities cited at p 13 of submissions filed on behalf of the 2nd, 6th, 7th and 9th respondents.  
         
         
        31 While the proceedings purport to be brought under the Act, they in fact were not so brought, and s 17(1) has therefore no power to awarding costs of the court.  
         
         
        32 The Court of Criminal Appeal has implied power to control abuse of its processes. This purported appeal from McClellan J is an abuse of process. It is an incident to such a power to control abuses of its processes that the court has implied (or inherent) power to order the applicants to pay the respondents’ costs. See  
        Darcey v Pre-Term Foundation Clinic  
        (1983) 2 NSWLR 497 at 503;  
        R v Barbaro  
        (1992) 106 
          
        FLR 387 at 389; 
          
        and 
         Director General, Department of Community Services v Houdek 
         [1999] NSWSC 1031. The dichotomy between implied and inherent powers matters not in this context.  
         
         
        33 In this matter it was made plain to the applicants that the Court of Criminal Appeal did not have any jurisdiction to entertain their appeal and that costs would be sought against them. Notwithstanding, they have persisted in the appeal and the court has found that it has no jurisdiction.  
         
         
        34 The respondents have been caused costs and expense in order to respond to the appeal and they are entitled to their costs from the applicants. The costs awarded by McClellan J and by this court are compensatory and are not awarded as a punishment of the applicants. 
         
        
       
      
    78 The respondent here complained that the fact that the appeal was incompetent had been raised for the applicant’s assistance in the proceedings before the Registrar on 11 February, but the applicant elected to pursue his appeal notwithstanding the jurisdictional difficulty. In those circumstances, it should be awarded the costs incurred in responding to the appeal.  
     
      
    79 In Re Application by John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd re MSK, MAK, MMK and MRK [2006] NSWCCA 386 Spigelman CJ, with whom Basten JA and Hislop J agreed, had to consider a costs application in another case where the Court’s implied power to award costs identified in Markisic was relied on. The order sought was refused, Spigelman CJ observing at [34] - [36]: 
     
      
       
        
         
        34 With respect to the application of MMK and MRK, the submissions did not identify in any respect what it was that could have constituted an abuse of process sufficient to invoke the implied power affirmed by this Court in  
        Markisic 
        .  
         
         
        35 The most that could be said was that, in view of the jurisdictional issue on which the Applicant has failed, the proceedings were at all times hopeless. Indeed the original submissions filed in support of the application failed to recognise in any way the jurisdictional issue that has proven to be decisive.  
         
         
        36 Nevertheless, a successful jurisdictional objection is not enough to justify a finding of abuse of process for the purpose of making a special order as to costs. 
         
        
       
      
    80 In R v JS (No 2) [2007] NSWCCA 309; (2007) 179 A Crim R 10, Spigelman CJ, with whom Mason P, McClellan CJ at CL, Hidden and Howie JJ agreed, again considered the Court’s implied power to award costs, observing at [17] that the type of proceedings with which Markisic was concerned, were ‘proceedings which cannot be called an appeal at all’.  
     
      
    81 In this case the appeal was disposed of on the basis of a refusal of leave. The leave application was certainly a hopeless one, but that is not a basis on which a costs order may be made under this statutory scheme. The applicant’s jurisdictional argument was also problematic, but the view that it was such that it could properly be described as involving no application for leave to appeal at all, is not open in this case. 
     
      
    82 In those circumstances it follows that like in Re Application by John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd, there can be no costs awarded in the respondent’s favour, given the provisions of s 17 of the Criminal Appeal Act.  
     
      
       
      Order 
       
      
    83 For these reasons the orders I would propose are: 
     
      
       
        
        (i) Grant leave to the Applicant to file the Second Amended Application for Leave to Appeal, dated 5 March 2010 and extend time accordingly. 
         
         
        (ii) Refuse leave to appeal. 
         
          
         
        (iii) Make no order as to costs

     Judgment 
    [1] This is an application by the defendant in defamation proceedings to strike out imputations pleaded by the plaintiff. The defendant asserts that all but the first of the eight imputation pleaded are unable to be conveyed and/or bad in form. 
    [2] The plaintiff’s proceedings for defamation were brought following a Today Tonight programme broadcast on 7 January 2010 (“the broadcast”) which was entitled “Pollies’ Perks”. A transcript of the programme is set out as a schedule to this judgment.[3] The plaintiff pleads that the broadcast conveys the following imputations: 
     
     (a) The plaintiff wasted taxpayers’ money (paragraphs 19 – 25); 
      
     (b) The plaintiff abused her right to have an overseas trip (19 – 25); 
      
     (c) The plaintiff rorted the system by going on a taxpayer funded study trip but did not study (19 – 25); 
      
     (d) The plaintiff cheated taxpayers by spending more than $17,000 for a study trip to Italy because the reason she went there was not to study but to reconnect with her heritage (19 – 25); 
      
     (e) The plaintiff is unfit to be a member of parliament (19 – 25); 
      
     (f) The plaintiff cheated taxpayers (19 – 25); 
      
     (g) The plaintiff went on a dubious study trip (19 – 25); 
      
     (h) The plaintiff’s abuse of her overseas study trip contributed to a complete review of the entitlements system and the possible scrapping of study trips (19 – 25). 
    [4] In the course of argument the plaintiff sought leave to replead imputations (b) and (d) so that imputation (b) will now read: 
     
     “The plaintiff abused her entitlement to have an overseas trip by spending more than $17,000 for a study trip to Italy, because the reason she went there was not to study, but to reconnect with her heritage.” 
      
    [5] There being no challenge to imputation (a), the imputations which are the subject of my rulings are imputations (c), (e), (f), (g) and (h). As can be seen from the paragraph references above, these imputations are all asserted to arise from a short segment towards the end of the broadcast. The relevant part, in my view, is the portion commencing from “those dubious study trips” and the specific reference to the plaintiff’s trip in paragraph 25, followed by the comment of Senator Fielding in paragraph 26 and the reference to the review of study trips by Senator Lewis in paragraph 27.  
     
       
    [6] However, the portions of the broadcast referring to the plaintiff need to be seen in context of the whole of the broadcast, including its title, “Pollies’ Perks”. The broadcast is predicated upon the basis that a considerable amount of overseas travel for politicians is a “perk” and concludes on the self-congratulatory note that “after more than a year of pressure from Today Tonight, these perks will soon be a thing of the past”. [7] I shall deal with each of the imputations challenged in turn.Imputation (c): The plaintiff rorted the system by going on a taxpayer funded study trip but did not study[8] I accept the defendant’s complaint that this imputation is a restatement of the elements in imputation (b) which, by reason of its closer connection to what the text actually says (i.e. that she went to Italy to reconnect with her heritage), more accurately conveys the meaning than imputation (c). There is no discernable difference between allegations of abusing an entitlement to having an overseas trip and rorting the system by going on such a trip. Imputations should plead a different act or condition, not a mere shade of meaning. This imputation is struck out on the basis of failure to differ in substance from imputation (b) as repleaded. 
    Imputation (e): The plaintiff is unfit to be a member of parliament [9] The defendant submits that this imputation is not conveyed and that, by reason of the failure to identify the conduct in terms different to one or more of the other imputations, it is a rhetorical flourish.[10] The broadcast complains of the “perks” of politicians in terms of money wasted on overseas trips, and ends with the claim that a complete review of the entitlements system will mean that “study tours could be scrapped”. It does not, however, assert that any of the politicians under attack are unfit to hold office; the basic premise is that all this money on overseas trips is money wasted. [11] The defendant additionally complains about the form of an imputation that simply states the plaintiff is unfit. If an imputation goes on to state what the plaintiff is asserted to be unfit for, and why, an imputation of unfitness may be permitted: see Field v John Fairfax Publications Ltd [2004] NSWSC 1285; O’Shane v John Fairfax Publications [2004] NSWSC 140. As to whether it is possible to plead imputations that a plaintiff is “unfit” to hold a particular kind of employment, I agree with the observations of Levine J in Kriss v John Fairfax Publications Ltd [2003] NSWSC 319 at [8]-[9], where his Honour explained:  
     
     “[8] As to imputation 3(a),  
     “The Plaintiff is unfit to be a barrister” 
     , the defendant argues that the matter complained of is simply incapable as a matter of law of carrying it. There is certainly no express allegation in the broadcast that the plaintiff was unfit. Indeed the overall impression to be gained from the publication of the plaintiff is not that he was unfit but rather that his readmission to the Bar was contrary to the flow of  
     “traffic heading the other way”. 
      That traffic in the other direction was made up of barristers who had been struck off by reason of either failing to file a tax return or being bankrupted by the Tax Office. There is nothing in the article that equates Mr Kriss with the persons referred to in it other than the statement of fact that he was  
     “bankrupted” 
     . The article makes clear that Cooper AJ had said that there was no suggestion that the plaintiff’s bankruptcy involved any moral turpitude and that in every respect he was a fit and proper person to be a barrister. The notion of  
     “turn up for the books” 
      and  
     “marvel”  
     is referable merely to the plaintiff being readmitted to the Bar, having been, inter alia, bankrupted, when the  
     “traffic” 
      was constituted by members of the Bar being struck off. Whilst it might be more pertinent to imputation (c), the  
     “surprise”  
     is that contrary to the recent trend, here we have a barrister who is being readmitted having been struck off.  
      
      
     [9] The defendant also argues that the imputation is rhetorical, founded in the statements made in that regard by Hunt J in  
     Morris v Newcastle Newspapers Pty Ltd 
      [1985] 1 NSWLR 260 at 270-271 and 272E-G. I do not consider the imputation as a matter of form to be rhetorical or otherwise by reference to the other imputations pleaded. It is simply incapable of being carried and I so hold.” 
    [12] In the present case, the imputation is, similarly, incapable of being conveyed, rather than being rhetorical, and it is struck out on that basis.  
    Imputation (f): The plaintiff cheated taxpayers 
    [13] I accept the submissions of the defendant that this imputation does not differ in substance from the redrafted imputation (b), other than to raise the act of wrongdoing to an impermissibly higher level of abstraction. I reject, however, the defendant’s complaint that this imputation is rhetorical.  
    [14] As this objection was raised to several of the imputations, I should note the explanation of Simpson J in Viney v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [2006] NSWSC 1273 at [22]-[25] as to whether this is a valid complaint: 
     
     “[22] The next complaint is that the imputation is “rhetorical”. No argument was advanced to support that description. Reliance was placed upon another decision of Hunt J,  
     Morris v Newcastle Newspapers Pty Ltd 
       
     [1985] 1 NSWLR 260. At 272 his Honour was considering an imputation: 
      
      
       
      “ … that the plaintiff was not a fit and proper person to be a member of the Federal Parliament” 
      
      
     His Honour did characterise this imputation as “rhetorical”, but did not explain what he meant by it. He recorded an admission by the plaintiff that the imputation was intended to be “no more than a rhetorical flourish”. Again, in the authorities to which I was referred, imputations were sometimes characterised as “rhetorical”, but there has been no attempt to pin down the meaning of that expression, or to establish what amounts to a “rhetorical” imputation. The Macquarie Dictionary (Limited Edition, 1985) gives three meanings of “rhetorical”:  
      
      
       
      “1. belong to or concerned with mere style or effect; 2. having the nature of rhetoric; 3. overelaborate, bombastic in style.” 
      
      
     [23] Reference to the decision of the Court of Appeal in  
     Morosi v Mirror Newspapers Ltd  
     [1977] 2 NSWLR 749 at 771 (cited by Hunt J, in this context, in  
     Morris 
      (see p 272)), suggests that the term is used to denote repetitive imputations, not differing in substance one from another, a pleading practice prohibited, first by  
     SCR  
     Pt 67 r11(3), and now by  
     UCPR 
      14.30(3): see also  
     Grubb v Bristol United Press Ltd  
     [1963] 1 QB 309, at 328, 329; and  
     Lewis v Daily Telegraph 
      [1964] AC 234 at 278, (where the pleading of true innuendo in addition to the natural and ordinary meaning of the words in the broadcast was criticised as “rhetorical”), both also cited by Hunt J in  
     Morris 
     . 
      
      
     [24] If that is what is meant by “a rhetorical imputation”, a complaint to that effect merely duplicates a complaint that the imputations in question fall foul of the rule. In my opinion, the time has come for defendants’ counsel to bury the practice of attacking imputations pleaded by plaintiffs on the basis that they are “rhetorical”; alternatively to specify precisely what they mean by the epithet. Otherwise, the complaint is, itself, mere rhetoric. 
      
      
     [25] In my opinion an expression which is rhetorical is one that has little content or substance, but comes with a good deal of prejudicial flourish. I can readily understand how a publication may be said to be “rhetorical”. It is more difficult to see how an imputation can be rhetorical, unless, as I suggest, it merely means repetitive. There is, in my opinion, nothing “rhetorical” about the terms of this imputation. I would reject this challenge.” 
      
    [15] Imputation (f), although not rhetorical (for the reasons explained by Simpson J) will, however, be struck out on the basis that it does not differ in substance from the repleaded imputation (b). 
    Imputation (g): The plaintiff went on a dubious study trip[16] The defendant submits that notwithstanding the use of the term “dubious” in the matter complained of, the imputation is ambiguous and bad in form, in that it would be impossible for a jury to distil the sting with any reasonable precision, or for a defendant to know in what way the imputation would, or could, be justified. [17] However, the opening words of the broadcast (paragraph 22) are: 
     
     “Then there’s those dubious study trips”. 
    [18] The emphatic way that these words are spoken (followed by a photograph of Liberal MP Fran Bailey asleep) makes it clear that this part of the broadcast is dedicated to the investigation of overseas trips that are dubious. The first example of a dubious study trip is Ms Bailey who, we are told, was “last seen asleep at the NATO Assembly in Edinburgh” and is now retiring, “so it’s hard to see how taxpayers got value for money”. The second is Liberal MP Petro Georgiou. The basis for asserting that his study trip was dubious seems to be that he was “Ms Bailey’s colleague” (paragraph 24). The third and final example is the plaintiff, who is seen talking vivaciously and waving her arms while the rhetorical question of where else would Senator Concetta Ferravanti-Wells go for her study trip but Italy is put to the viewer.[19] How could it be said that this imputation would be better conveyed by using a word other than the defendant’s own description of “dubious” in the imputation? The claim that the defendant would not know what to justify is disingenuous, for the reasons explained by Hutley JA in Hepburn v TCN Channel Nine Pty Ltd [1983] 2 NSWLR 682 at 688B, explained and followed by Gleeson CJ at CL in Drummoyne Municipal Council v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1990) 21 NSWLR 135 at 137 (endorsing Hutley JA’s remarks), endorsed again by Levine J in Young v Munro (Supreme Court of NSW, 12 May 1995, unreported) and by the NSW Court of Appeal in a series of decisions (summarised in Baker v Nightingale [2008] NSWDC 103 at [9]-[10]) permitting imputations to be pleaded using the words of the matter complained of. [20] This is a very clear example of the sting of the imputation being best encapsulated by the actual words of the publication. Hutley JA in Hepburn considered, in 1983, it was “strange to hear” the suggestion that a defendant does not understand an imputation which is in precisely the words it has used. It is equally strange to hear such a suggestion being made in 2010.[21] Imputation (g) is capable of being conveyed.Imputation (h): The plaintiff’s abuse of her overseas study trip contributed to a complete review of the entitlement system and the possible scrapping of study trips[22] The defendant submits that this imputation is “far-fetched and divorced from the broadcast” and complains that the word “contributed to” does not identify whether or not the plaintiff is asserting her study trip was in fact one of the study trips under consideration in this review.[23] The framer of the imputation appears to be hesitating between an imputation that the plaintiff’s trips was one of the trips which was reviewed by Special Minister of State Joe Ludwig, or whether it has in some other way been connected to or contributed to this review, or whether it is an example of what Mr Ludwig was concerned about. Whatever imputation the plaintiff is aiming for, it should be pleaded in clear terms. [24] Imputation (h) is struck out with leave to replead, and I note I have made an order for a further amended statement of claim to be filed in 7 days.Costs[25] The defendant has successfully challenged a number of the plaintiff’s imputations and costs should follow the event.Orders 
     
      
     (1) Note there is no challenge to imputation (a). 
      
     (2) Grant the plaintiff leave to replead imputations (b) and (d) as follows: “The plaintiff abused her entitlement to have an overseas trip by spending more than $17,000 for a study trip to Italy, because the reason she went there was not to study, but to reconnect with her heritage.” 
      
     (3) Imputation (h) is struck out with leave to replead. 
      
     (4) Strike out imputations (c), (e) and (f). 
      
     (5) Plaintiff pay the defendant’s costs. 
      
     (6) Plaintiff to file amended statement of claim in 7 days.

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: I agree with Howie J. 
     
      
    2 HOWIE J: The appellant was convicted of supplying a prohibited drug contrary to s 25 of the Drug Misuse and Trafficking Act. The offence was based upon an allegation that the appellant was in possession of a quantity of methamphetamine being about 15 times the traffickable quantity prescribed for that drug. The appellant was sentenced to a term of imprisonment but there is no application for leave to appeal. It must be noted that on its face a sentence with a non-parole period of only 8 months appears inadequate to a very considerable degree. However, there was no Crown appeal. The result of the sentence imposed is that the appellant has completed his non-parole period and the sentence in its entirety expired on 25 March last. 
     
      
    3 There was little, or no, dispute about the facts in the prosecution case. The only issue for the jury was whether the Crown had proved beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was in possession of the drugs that were found in the glove box of a vehicle that he was driving when pulled over by police on 10 May 2007. The appellant gave evidence and denied knowledge of the presence of the drugs. The owner of the vehicle gave evidence denying that the drugs were his. The verdict of the jury means that they were satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the account given by the appellant was untrue. 
     
      
    4 The ground of appeal raises the admissibility of the audio track of a video recording of the events following the police stopping the appellant for speeding on the Sturt Highway outside Wagga Wagga at about 10.40pm on 10 May 2007. The police by the use of a speed radar ascertained that the appellant was driving at 120kph in a 100kph speed zone. The appellant was made to stop the vehicle on the roadside. As Sgt McLachlan exited the police vehicle, he saw the appellant lean towards the left side of the vehicle that he was driving. 
     
      
    5 The police vehicle was fitted with in car video equipment (ICV). There were two cameras in the system: one camera faced the front of the vehicle and the other the rear. The officers had portable microphones fitted to their belts for recording an audio track to the video. The video recording continued for a period of about two hours while the appellant was stopped at the roadside. Some of that period was spent waiting for a police truck and video equipment to arrive. An edited copy of the video recording with the audio track was played to the jury.  
     
      
    6 The video records the following. The appellant can be seen to lean to the left side of the vehicle as police approached. The police officer advised the appellant that “everything is being recorded”. He was told that, in light of the fact that he was sweating and seemed nervous, the police intended to search the vehicle. The appellant left the vehicle and was searched. A discussion occurred about the purpose of the appellant’s trip. Sgt McLachlan searched the interior of the vehicle and returned to the appellant and asked, “What’s in here Matthew?” The appellant was then cautioned. The appellant was shown a plastic container with plastic bags containing white powder. After the appellant indicated that he did not want to say anything, he was told that he was under arrest “for possession of a prohibited substance”. 
     
      
    7 The appellant then entered the back seat of the police vehicle and was advised that the vehicle was fitted with video and audio recorders that would continue recording. The front camera was then turned towards where the appellant was sitting. The appellant left the vehicle at one stage to have a cigarette. There was then a conversation between the appellant and Sgt McLachlan that was recorded on the audio track. He asks, referring to the white powder, “Is it ice?” The appellant replies, “No, its not ice its speed that’s all it is.” He is asked, “How much is in there?” and the appellant replies, “Two ounces”. 
     
      
    8 It is now asserted that the audio recording of the conversation between the appellant and the police officer was inadmissible as it was unlawfully obtained because of provisions in relation to the use of ICV. Although various objections were taken to these conversations at the trial, it was not argued that s 138 of the Evidence Act applied. Counsel who appeared for the appellant at the trial has made an affidavit in which he states that he was unaware of the provision that is relied upon in this Court to support the present objection to the admissibility of the evidence. There is nothing to indicate why the Crown prosecutor did not raise the issue under the Crown’s duty of fairness. 
     
      
    9 The basis upon which it is now argued that the audio track of the tape was unlawfully obtained is certain provisions of the Law Enforcement (Powers and Responsibilities) Act 2002 and in particular s 108E of that Act. The relevant provisions are as follows: 
     
      
       
        
         
        108B Police activities requiring use of ICV equipment  
         
        For the purposes of this Part, the following police activities are “ 
        police activities that require the use of ICV equipment 
        ”:  
         
          
          (a) pursuing or otherwise following a vehicle with the intention of stopping or detaining the vehicle,  
           
          (b) activities in relation to a vehicle that has been stopped or detained, or in relation to the driver or any occupant of the vehicle while in or about the vehicle (whether or not the vehicle was stopped or detained after being pursued or otherwise followed under paragraph (a)).  
          
         
         
        108C Mandatory use of ICV equipment  
         
        (1) If a police vehicle is equipped with ICV equipment, the driver of the vehicle must ensure that while the vehicle is being used in the course of police activities that require the use of ICV equipment:  
         
          
          (a) the ICV equipment is operated for the purpose of recording a view from the police vehicle of those activities, and  
           
          (b) a conversation between the police officer and the driver or any occupant of a vehicle stopped or detained in the course of those activities is recorded by means of the ICV equipment.  
          
         
         
        (2) The authority conferred by this section to record a conversation (the “ 
        primary conversation 
        ”) extends to authorise the recording of another conversation the recording of which is incidental to the recording of the primary conversation or that is inadvertently or unexpectedly recorded in the course of recording the primary conversation. 
         
         
        (3) Any failure to operate ICV equipment or to record a conversation as required by this section:  
         
          
          (a) does not of itself limit or otherwise affect the admissibility of evidence of any matter concerning the police activities to which the failure related, and  
           
          (b) does not of itself result in any such evidence being evidence improperly or unlawfully obtained,  
          
         
        but this subsection does not otherwise affect the operation of any rules as to admissibility of evidence. 
         
         
        108D Person to be informed that conversation will be recorded  
         
        (1) A police officer who records a conversation between the police officer and another person under this Part must inform the person (either immediately before recording of the conversation commences or as soon as practicable after recording has commenced) that the conversation will be recorded using police in-car video equipment. 
         
         
        (2) This section does not apply to the recording of a conversation inadvertently or unexpectedly or incidentally to the recording of another conversation. 
         
         
        (3) Recording of a conversation does not require the consent of the person and the authority conferred by this Part is not affected by any objection or refusal to consent by the person to the recording. 
         
         
        108E Recording not authorised after arrest  
         
        (1) A conversation between a police officer and a person must not be recorded under this Part after the person has been arrested. 
         
         
        (2) This section does not apply to the recording of a conversation inadvertently or unexpectedly or during the period between the person’s arrest and the first reasonably practicable opportunity to discontinue recording of the conversation. 
         
         
        (3) This section applies only to the recording of the sounds of a conversation. It does not apply to the recording of visual images of the conversation. 
        
       
      
    10 It is not in dispute that, contrary to the prohibition contained in s 108E(1), the arresting police continued to make an audio recording of the conversations that took place after the appellant had been arrested. However, because the point was not taken at the trial there was no investigation of why the police officers did not comply with the provision. Although counsel for the appellant conceded in this Court that the particular officers might have been unaware of the provision, that is mere speculation. It is clear that Sgt McLachlan was aware that there was an obligation to inform the appellant that the proceedings were being recorded and he did this twice: see 108D(1). 
     
      
    11 Of course simply because the audio recording of the conversations with the appellant was unlawfully made, it does not necessarily follow that a trial judge would reject the evidence. One of the issues to be considered under s 138 is whether the breach of the law by the police officers was intentional or reckless. Another relevant factor in determining whether to exercise the discretion to admit the evidence would be the policy behind the prohibition in 108E(1). 
     
      
    12 The second reading speech made by the Attorney General when introducing the bill said this about the use of ICV (Hansard Legislative Council 9 December 2004): 
     
      
       
        
         
        The significant benefits of ICV are that it enhances officer safety and provides an accurate independent witness to events, protecting both police and members of the public against unfounded allegations of improper conduct and behaviour. 
        
       
      
    13 As to the particular provisions with which this appeal is concerned the Attorney said: 
     
      
       
        
         
        Once an officer arrests a person, the audio component of the ICV system must be turned off at the first reasonably practicable opportunity. The inclusion of the wording ""the first reasonably practicable opportunity"" is intended to ensure police officers’ safety. If an arrested person is violent towards police and has to be subdued then an officer must be able to contain that person before switching off the audio component of the ICV. 
         
         
        Similarly, if the arrested person is part of a group and police are continuing to exercise investigative or other powers in relation to that group or vehicle it will, under this bill, be permissible for both components of the ICV to continue recording as long as the arrested person is removed from the area that has been captured by the ICV. 
         
         
        It is important to understand that the use of the term ""arrest"" in this bill, for example at section 108E, means the officer telling the person that they are under arrest and not just by the fact of the person's vehicle being pulled over or detained…………. 
        
       
      
    14 There is nothing in the speech that explains the policy behind s 108E. I can only conjecture that it was thought that the police officer should not interrogate a suspect at the scene rather than take the person to a police station to be formally dealt with as a person under arrest. However, there would have been no prohibition upon the officer turning off the microphone that was part of the ICV but recording the conversation on a separate recording device. There is no prohibition on a police officer arresting a person and then asking questions provided that the person is given a caution as occurred here. In fact, if the officer had not electronically recorded the conversation that followed after arrest, the evidence would prima facie be inadmissible: see s 281 of the Criminal Procedure Act. If the recording by ICV of the conversation were admissible, it would have complied with s 281. 
     
      
    15 I do not appreciate why, if there is a general requirement on police to electronically record conversations with suspected persons and in particular after arrest, the recording of such a conversation cannot be made by use of the ICV. If the police officer acts inappropriately in questioning the person after arrest, for example by failing to give the suspect a caution or by continuing to question after the suspect indicates an unwillingness to be interrogated, it is better that this conduct be electronically recorded than not. Objections can be taken to the recorded conversation based upon the impropriety of the police questioning. 
     
      
    16 The result of the prohibition seems to me to be very curious indeed. A recording of the conversation made by a separate tape recorder would not only have been lawful but would have been required for the conversation to be admitted into evidence. Yet a recording of the same conversation by the ICV system is unlawful and liable to be rejected for that reason alone. 
     
      
    17 However that may be, Parliament has determined as part of the scheme for the use of ICV that audio recording must stop upon arrest. It may be appropriate for the court in a suitable case to enforce that policy by rejection of the evidence. Whether it would be appropriate to do so on the facts of this case, I am unable to determine in the absence of evidence as to why the recording was not turned off. Without an investigation of the reasons for the failure to comply with s 108E, I do not believe this Court is in a position to determine that, even had the objection been taken, a reasonable judge would have admitted the evidence applying s 138. If the decision was made not to turn off the audio recording as a deliberate flouting of the statutory provision, I can understand that a judge might reject the evidence to uphold the policy of Parliament even though it may be difficult to discern what it was. 
     
      
    18 Although no objection was taken to the evidence on the basis now placed before this Court, there was objection taken to it and it could not have been in the appellant’s interest to have it admitted. The Crown had a responsibility to draw the Court’s attention to the unlawfulness of the evidence when it was clearly in breach of a provision of the legislation that authorised the use of the ICV. 
     
      
    19 There was no error by the trial judge because no objection was taken to the evidence on the basis that it was unlawful. The question that arises, therefore, is whether the appellant has satisfied the Court that the admission of the evidence has led to a substantial miscarriage of justice. That question is answered by a consideration of the whole of the record of the evidence, including the fact that the jury convicted the appellant, in order to determine whether, “making due allowance for the ‘natural limitations’ that exist in the case of an appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record the accused was proved beyond reasonable doubt to be guilty of the offence on which the jury returned its verdict of guilty”: Weiss v The Queen [2005] HCA 81; (2005) 224 CLR 300 at [41] (footnote omitted). 
     
      
    20 In my opinion, even absent the admissions, the prosecution case was very strong. The following were the circumstances that pointed to the appellant’s guilt: the drugs were found in the glove box of the vehicle that the appellant was driving; the appellant was seen to reach to the left as the police approached the vehicle; the appellant was obviously nervous which led the police to search the vehicle; the owner of the vehicle gave evidence that he had no knowledge of the drugs in the vehicle; the appellant was a recreational user of the drug at the time; and the implausibility of any other person inadvertently leaving that amount of the drug in a vehicle that the person had borrowed from the owner. There was evidence that the drug was worth in excess of $26,000. 
     
      
    21 The police gave evidence that the mobile phone being used by the appellant was found in the glove box although the appellant denied that fact during his evidence. In any event, the appellant was using a mobile phone that did not belong to him which is consistent with his being a drug courier. 
     
      
    22 There was also the implausibility of the appellant’s account of why he was driving to Wagga from Sydney. He gave evidence that he was driving to see a friend, for whom he was to be best man at the friend’s wedding, to organise a buck’s night that was to take place in September. It will be recalled that he was arrested in May. He was to stay only one day as he had to return to Sydney for another wedding despite the fact that the journey to and from Wagga took four hours each way. He had no change of clothes and undertook the journey even though he was tired from “a big night before”. He had not told his friend that he was coming and had little money. He admitted being short of finances at the time during cross-examination. 
     
      
    23 There was no dispute as to the admissions and the appellant gave an exculpatory explanation for them on the basis that he recognised the drug and the amount in the package from his familiarity with the drug and the manner in which it was sold. That evidence has no impact upon my opinion that the appellant’s account could not reasonably be true. In my opinion it was an overwhelming circumstantial case independent of the evidence to which objection is now taken. I am satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that the appellant was in possession of the drug and that he was taking it to Wagga for the purposes of supply. 
     
      
    24 I propose that the appeal be dismissed. 
     
      
    25 HARRISON J: I agree with Howie J.

   JUDGMENT1 HIS HONOUR: On 24 March 2010 after a four and a half week trial a jury found the offender guilty of attempting to possess a quantity of methamphetamine which had been imported into Australia. The quantity was significant, it was fifteen kilograms of a powder which contained ten kilograms of pure methamphetamine. The maximum penalty for that offence is life imprisonment. It is, as the maximum penalty demonstrates, a very serious offence indeed, and the quantity involved was thirteen times that which exposed the offender to that maximum penalty of life imprisonment.2 The offender played a very important role in the process of importing what he believed were drugs from Canada and making them available to drug users in Australia. He was responsible for taking delivery of the drugs and passing them on to the distributor, a man by the name of Chan. The offender was intimately involved in the operation, using his own initiative in making decisions. He was far from a mere foot soldier.3 The drugs were secreted in three hard shell suitcases sent from Canada to Sydney. Once they arrived in Australia police deconstructed the suitcases, removed the powder secreted within and replaced that powder with an inert substance. That explains why the offence with which the offender was charged was an attempt. The suitcases were put back together and ultimately a controlled delivery was carried out. Undercover police posing as delivery men took the suitcases to the offender where he was living. He then took custody of the suitcases and passed them over to others involved in the operation, after they first checked by means of an angle grinder that the bags contained what they thought was the quantity of drugs. Although the time during which the offender possessed the suitcases, believing them to have drugs secreted inside, was very short, his involvement in the matter extended over a significant period. He was responsible for organising the delivery of the suitcases to himself after they had arrived in Australia. This process was not straightforward, because of two particular complications. The first was that the offender’s telephone number was incorrectly recorded on the shipping documents, particularly the bill of lading. The second was that another man, whom the offender had intended to actually take possession of the suitcases once they had cleared Customs, got cold feet and pulled out.4 The offender’s telephone calls were intercepted and the jury were able to hear for themselves what the offender did to overcome those problems. The offender, as I said, used his own initiative to overcome these difficulties.5 The drugs had been sent to Australia by the offender’s oldest son who lived in Canada. Most of the intercepted calls involved the offender and his son passing information between themselves to facilitate the clearance of the suitcases through Customs and the delivery of the suitcases to the offender. Some of the recorded conversations were highly incriminating indeed. It was here that the offender’s attempts to explain the inexplicable failed lamentably.6 Part of the offender’s case was that he had been threatened by cruel Chinese gangs. Those threats were said to be that if he did not do what was required of him, not only would he be killed but so would his four sons, then living in Canada. Part way through the trial I delivered a judgment in which the defence of duress was removed from the jury’s consideration. It was no part of what I had to decide at that stage to make a finding as to whether or not the offender was really threatened, as he said he was. However for the purposes of these remarks on sentence, I am able to say without a moment’s hesitation that I completely reject the offender’s evidence that he was threatened. There are many reasons for me making this finding. Let me briefly explain.7 The intercepted telephone calls contained not the slightest hint of the offender ever talking to his son about the threats he said he had received or asking after his children, despite his evidence that his son knew about the threats and indeed had been subjected to threats by Chinese gangs himself.8 The offender explained this circumstance by saying that he communicated with his son about these threats over the internet, using what I understood to be a method of communication called voice over internet protocol or VOIP. It is a remarkable state of affairs that the offender’s evidence was that these conversations took place only over a medium which the offender well knows was not intercepted by police.9 The offender gave evidence that one evening on 19 August 2007 he was visited by Chinese people in Sydney who threatened him even more seriously than he had been previously threatened, yet when the offender spoke to his son the following morning he made no reference to such threats. In cross-examination the offender attempted to say that he had already spoken to his son about the threats using VOIP, but as the content of the intercepted call made clear, there had been no such communication between them. The offender’s cross-examination on this issue revealed the dishonesty of what he was saying. The Crown cleverly laid a trap for him and the offender fell into it.10 Perhaps the strongest piece of evidence pointing to the falsity of the offender’s claim to have been threatened, is his behaviour when being interviewed by police once police had intervened and the contents of the suitcases seized by them. According to the accused, his children, the youngest of whom was at that stage only twelve, were going to be killed, yet there is not the slightest hint of any concern that the offender had for the welfare of his children when he was speaking to police. What he said and how he appeared was entirely inconsistent with him being a person who was afraid for the safety of his children. Indeed he was more concerned at not having eaten for a while.11 So I am able to reject completely any suggestion that the offender was acting under duress. Other parts of the offender’s evidence were equally ridiculous. He claimed that whilst he had initially suspected that the suitcases might contain drugs, he later formed the view that they contained something like antiques. This claim did not sit very well with the offender’s evidence that his life and that of his children were at risk if he did not take possession of the suitcases. In any case, by their verdict the jury clearly rejected the offender’s evidence. In coming to that conclusion the jury no doubt took account of the contents of conversations between the offender and his son such as these I will now mention. 
     
      
       
       The offender was told that what was in the suitcases had been well hidden and if police had found what had been hidden, then there would have been obvious damage to the suitcases.  
       
      
     
     
      
       
       The offender acknowledged that if when he went to pick the suitcases up they had been damaged, then he would simply deny that the suitcases were his and say that there had been some mistake. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       In one conversation the offender is told by his son that there are “three suitcases each containing five”. This is clearly a reference to each suitcase containing five kilograms, which precisely matches the quantity of powder seized by police. 
       
      
     
     
      
       
       In another telephone call the offender was told that if the police had found “it” they would have made an arrest already. So the fact that no one had been arrested meant that the drugs had not been found. 
       
      
    12 Of course when the offender’s evidence that he had been threatened with death was combined with his evidence that he thought that the suitcases merely contained antiques, this gave rise to the somewhat Monty Python-esque spectre of cruel and even homicidal antique dealers threatening to kill innocent children in order to persuade others to assist them to send legal antiques across the Pacific.13 I find that the offender knew at all relevant times, that the suitcases contained drugs. This was not something that the offender learned about only shortly before he came into possession of the drugs. The telephone intercepts make clear that the offender was intimately involved in this operation from the beginning.14 I am able to say also that the offender came to Australia for the purpose of carrying out this offence. It was his evidence at trial and argued by Mr Santisi on sentence that the offender came to Australia for a legitimate purpose and only once he was here did he become involved in the operation to have the drugs imported. I reject that as not being reasonably possible.15 The structure of the operation and in particular the fact that the offender is from Canada and he was dealing with his son who was back in Canada, strongly suggests that he came to Australia for the purposes of being involved in the importation. It would make no sense for an operation to be planned involving the sending of drugs from Canada to Australia without there first being a plan as to who would receive the drugs once they came into Australia.16 Early in the piece the offender is talking about extending his visa in order to see through the completion of the importation operation. The bill of lading, as I mentioned, has his phone number except for a transcription error. Even if I am wrong and even if the offender did come to Australia for a legitimate purpose, that would not make a significant difference to the length of the sentence which I will shortly impose, because for the length of the offender’s involvement once he was in Australia and the efforts that he went to in order to see through the importation to completion.17 I am also able to say and find beyond reasonable doubt that in contrast to many offences that come before this Court, the offender well knew almost precisely the quantity of drugs involved. I refer again to the conversation where the offender was told that there were three suitcases, each containing “five”. I say again that that almost precisely matches the fifteen kilograms of powder found in the suitcases.18 The offender was born in Vietnam and travelled to Canada and became a Canadian citizen at the end of the Vietnam war. It may have been that whilst in Vietnam he and his family were subject to persecution and hardship. I say “it may have been” because the only evidence to suggest this has come from the offender himself and I have rejected his evidence in court as being largely a pack of lies. With that qualification, however, it does seem that some of what the offender said is true; namely, that he was born in Vietnam and travelled to Canada where he became a Canadian citizen.19 I accept also that he has four sons, one of whom was involved in this offence. He was arrested in Canada, but his whereabouts are presently unknown. His remaining three sons would seem to still live in Canada. The youngest is now fourteen. Who is caring for him, I do not know. During the trial the offender said that his younger son was being cared for by his older son. I do not know what the present position is, given that his oldest son can now no longer be found. He also has a child, it appears, living in Vietnam. After having divorced the mother of his four sons, he remarried. His present wife and three-year-old daughter are said to be living in Vietnam.20 The offender gave evidence that is repeated to a large extent in the Probation and Parole pre-sentence report; that once he arrived in Canada he worked as a cleaner or a kitchen hand. He then opened a Vietnamese restaurant for some time.21 He has no criminal history. If what I hear from him is true, he was an industrious person in Canada, working hard to benefit his family. Given the offender’s plea of not guilty, however, and my rejection of his evidence, to a large extent I am unable to ascertain why it is that he became involved in this offence.22 The offender did not plead guilty and of course he is not to be punished for that, nor does he receive any longer sentence because his evidence was full of holes and unbelievable to an extent rarely seen in these courts. What it does mean, however, is that he does not receive the discount that he would otherwise have received if he had admitted his guilt.23 The absence of a plea of guilty is also a matter which I will take into account in deciding whether the offender is remorseful. I say quite clearly there is no evidence at all that the offender is sorry for what he has done. He continued to tell the Probation and Parole Service the version of events which I have rejected. In those circumstances I am unable to find that the offender is remorseful. That in turn affects the question as to whether the offender will commit further offences upon his release from custody. I cannot say that there are good prospects for rehabilitation. I cannot say that there are not good prospects for rehabilitation. I cannot make a finding one way or the other given the absence of evidence on this matter.24 Others involved in the offence have also been sentenced. The Crown has provided me with the remarks on sentence of Judge Hock when she sentenced three of the other people involved. One in particular, Mr Chan, is of significance. The Crown asks that I accept that the criminality of the offender was higher than that of Mr Chan. It was Mr Chan who received the drugs and who appears to have been the distributor of drugs within Australia. I find that the offender’s objective criminality was similar to that of Mr Chan; no higher and no lower.25 The offender was involved in having the drugs brought into Australia, where he passed over control of the drugs and the role of distributing them to Mr Chan. Precisely what Mr Chan was going to do with them is a bit difficult to ascertain because he was arrested very soon after he came into the possession of them.26 Mr Chan was sentenced by Judge Hock to a lengthy sentence of imprisonment consistent of a head sentence of twelve years and six months with a non-parole period of seven years and six months. It is important to note that Mr Chan pleaded guilty at the Local Court and provided some assistance to the authorities. The combined discount that her Honour allowed for the plea and assistance was thirty per cent. The notional starting point for Mr Chan’s sentence would therefore have been approximately seventeen years and nine months. He also had no criminal history, but in contrast to this offender, he displayed genuine remorse and had reasonable prospects for rehabilitation.27 The Crown of course cannot rely on parity, as parity only works one way. The Crown cannot use a parity argument to suggest that the sentence imposed upon the offender should be of a certain length by reference to what her Honour did in imposing Mr Chan’s sentence. However the Crown has provided me with cases and other resources to establish, satisfactorily to my mind, the appropriate sentence that I should impose upon the offender. As it turns out, it will not be significantly different from the notional starting point of the sentence that her Honour imposed on Mr Chan.28 The offender relies on what is said to be hardship to members of his family. Once again the absence of reliable evidence on this matter makes such a finding difficult to make, but in any case even accepting everything that he said, the hardship that he refers to is not exceptional by any means. It must therefore be ignored.29 I will of course take into account that the offender is serving his sentence in a foreign country. He was assisted by an interpreter throughout the proceedings, which is consistent with his low level of ability to speak and understand English. That will make his time in custody harder than it would otherwise be the case. His family live either in Canada or Vietnam and that too will make his time in custody harder. Of course not too much can be made of this, the offender went into this operation very much with his eyes open, knowing that he was committing a serious offence in a foreign country and he must have known that were he detected, he would be spending a long time in prison, away from his family, with a number of other prisoners who did not speak his language.30 It is a remarkable thing for a man to reach the age of forty-eight years of age and then commit such a serious offence as this as his first breach of the law. The offender does have a bank of good character on which he is entitled to rely. Of course the authorities speak about the reduced significance of that circumstance where drug offences are involved, because people with prior good character are often used in order that people can travel from country to country. Those with drug convictions would not be able to do the sort of thing that the offender has done in the present case.31 Ultimately a lengthy sentence is necessarily called for. I return to where I started: The offender was intimately involved in an operation involving what he thought was a quantity of drugs thirteen times greater than that which would expose him to the maximum penalty of life imprisonment. It is a fundamental rule of sentencing that an offender’s sentence reflect the objective gravity of his conduct.32 In assessing that, not only do I look at the quantity of drugs involved, of course, I also look at what the offender did. He was enthusiastic, committed and industrious in doing what he could to see a large quantity of methamphetamine brought into Australia and handed over to someone else so it could be distributed to Australian citizens.33 It is well known that the profits to be made from such activities are significant and so the principles of general deterrence require that lengthy, even harsh sentences are imposed when offenders such as the present are detected and convicted.34 The offender is sentenced to imprisonment. I set a head sentence of eighteen years with a non-parole period of twelve years to date from 23 August 2007. The offender’s non-parole period will expire on 22 August 2019.35 Mr Le I am going to explain to you the sentence that I have just imposed. You must serve a minimum of twelve years in prison. That started on 23 August 2007, because that is the date that you were arrested. The earliest day that you can be released is 22 August 2019. It may be that you are released then or you may be kept in custody longer than that. That is a decision which will be made by the parole authorities. However the longest that you can be kept in custody is for a period of eighteen years, so you cannot be kept in custody after 22 August 2025.

    A. INTRODUCTIONNature of case1. The plaintiff, Mrs Helen Matthews, claims damages for physical and psychological injuries she sustained in a highway collision that occurred at about 4.00am on Wednesday 29 June 2005. At that time, the plaintiff was a front seat passenger in a motor vehicle being driven by her daughter, the first defendant, who was driving the second defendant’s motor vehicle south on the Pacific Highway near Ballina, NSW. 2. The plaintiff’s daughter lost control of the vehicle as she drove on a muddy road surface and in doing so, the vehicle slewed and then slid into collision with the trailer portion of a passing northbound semi-trailer vehicle. As a consequence, the plaintiff claims to have suffered physical and psychological injuries, for which she claims damages pursuant to the provisions of the Motor Accidents Compensation Act 1999 [“MAC Act”].Issues3. The defendants have admitted liability for the plaintiff’s injuries. The principal issues for determination concern the nature and extent of the plaintiff’s injuries, the extent to which she has suffered past and future loss of earning capacity, and the extent of her need for past and future domestic assistance and future treatment.4. The parties elected not to call oral evidence from the medical experts whom they had respectively retained to examine the plaintiff. This was in the context where there was conflict of opinion between the respective reports of those experts. That conflict was most pronounced in the case of the psychiatric opinions. The failure of the parties to call these experts to clarify the basis of their differing opinions has added to the analytical burden in this case : Majkic v Bonnano [2008] NSWCA 253 per Bell JA at [26]. This has necessitated a detailed review of the body of the evidence as a whole.5. The defendants claimed that the plaintiff had recovered from any psychiatric disorder she may have had as a consequence of the collision. The defendants based that submission on the report of the psychiatrist whom they had qualified to examine the plaintiff, yet the defendants declined to call that psychiatrist or to seek the opportunity to cross-examine or traduce the contrary psychiatric opinion to the effect that the plaintiff continued to suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder, a dysthymic disorder and chronic depression.6. To a lesser extent, a similar problem emerged regarding conflicting expert opinion concerning the plaintiff's ongoing neck, left shoulder and back problems, particularly as these problems impacted upon the plaintiff’s earning capacity and her need for domestic assistance.7. In the state in which the parties left the evidence, these issues had to be resolved by determining which of the expert opinions were the most persuasive: Larson v Commissioner of Police [2004] NSWCA 126 per Tobias JA at [48]. 8. In similar cases of this kind but where the damages claimed are relatively modest, an expedient and pragmatic approach, as was adopted by the parties in this case, may be understandable. However, in this case, where the damages claimed were substantial, different considerations arise.Credibility of testimony9. The credibility of the testimony of the plaintiff was an issue in this case. The challenge to the credibility of her testimony was in part based on a series of DVD images showing activity on her part. The challenge to the plaintiff’s credit was also in part based upon the content of histories recorded by medical examiners. Where those examiners were not called to clarify the matters in contention, credit challenges of that nature are necessarily rendered problematic : Mason v Demasi [2009] NSWCA 227; Container Terminals Australia Ltd v Huseyin [2008] NSWCA 320.10. In the circumstances of this case, where it became necessary to undertake a detailed evidence review, I have found the plaintiff to be a credible witness and I have accepted her evidence as being truthful. I consider that the DVD evidence shown by the defendants, and which provided an insight into some of the plaintiff’s activities, did not materially contradict her evidence, nor did it demonstrate that the plaintiff had exaggerated her evidence as was claimed on behalf of the defendants.11. In these circumstances, having undertaken a detailed review of the evidence of the plaintiff, her daughter, her sister and having compared this evidence with matters of history recorded in the various expert reports tendered, I have found a general consistency in the description of the plaintiff’s complaints, both in her evidence and as summarised in the reports. In these circumstances I consider that I am able to confidently rely upon the plaintiff’s evidence and those summaries, except where I have found a report to be deficient for reasons stated.12. Having accepted the plaintiff to be a credible witness, with the preceding qualification identified, I felt I could confidently rely upon the representations recorded in the histories of the plaintiff’s complaints as recorded by the assessing doctors when they surveyed the range and detail of her disabilities: Daw v Toyworld (NSW) Pty Ltd [2001] NSWCA 25 per Heydon JA at [70]; s 60 of the Evidence Act 1995. In my view, the plaintiff gave her evidence reasonably and with a tone of restraint and understatement when she related her problems. Summary of findings13. I have found that the collision in question has caused the plaintiff to suffer significant soft tissue neck and back injuries which have aggravated underlying degenerative changes in the plaintiff’s spine and which continue to have an ongoing adverse impact upon the plaintiff’s day to day activities and well-being. These injuries involved disc bulges and protrusions to various levels in the plaintiff’s neck and back. I have also found the plaintiff has suffered a significant psychological injury as a consequence of the collision on seeing her family members injured and put in peril. The result for the plaintiff has been post-traumatic stress disorder, dysthymic disorder, anxiety and depression, which are recognised psychiatric conditions. I have found the physical effects of her injuries have had a significant past and continuing adverse impact upon the plaintiff’s earning capacity and have resulted in the need for past and future domestic assistance and future treatment. I have assessed the plaintiff’s entitlement to damages in the amount of $715,687.Assessed heads of damage14. A total of 9 claimed heads of damage required assessment. The parties made disparate submissions on quantum. The heads of damage claimed by the plaintiff and the submissions of the parties, are listed below together with paragraph references to my assessment of the various heads of damage claimed:

    B. EVIDENCE REVIEW15. Before arriving at my findings on the issues for determination I consider it necessary to set out a summary of my review of the evidence.Overview of evidence 16. The plaintiff gave evidence and was cross-examined. Her daughter Melissa Jones also gave evidence, as did the plaintiff’s sister, Lorraine Holloway. The parties each tendered voluminous bundles of medical reports, which raised conflicting opinions on medical issues concerning the diagnosis of ongoing disabilities. No medical witnesses were called to give oral evidence to assist in the task of reconciling conflicting medical opinions. The defendants tendered the plaintiff’s income-tax returns as a bundle, without analysis. I have set out my summary of the medical and allied evidence and my conclusions drawn from that evidence, between paragraphs [74] and [202] of my reasons.Review of oral evidence17. In the paragraphs that follow between [18] and [73] I set out a summary of the oral evidence.The plaintiff, Mrs Helen MathewsPersonal history 18. The plaintiff was born in 1952. At the time of the injury she was aged 53 years. At the time of the trial she was aged 57 years. She had left school at the age of 16 years. She first married in 1971. The children of the first marriage were born in 1971, 1973 and 1974. She remarried in 1985 and she had her fourth child in that year. She has since separated from her second husband.Work history19. The plaintiff's work history commenced when she was aged 16 years. She had a history of steady employment in a variety of occupations. She has held positions as a shop assistant for a major chain store, she worked variously in a clerical position for a printing company, as a waitress, farm work collecting eggs, as a packer in a cheese factory, as a cashier for a department store and she has worked at a mail centre in Canberra. She has also worked as a shoe fitter for a department store, she has worked in a plant nursery serving customers, she has worked as a cashier/console operator at a petrol station, she has worked on the production line of a clothing factory and packaging goods in a pharmaceutical factory.20. Before her injury, the plaintiff was motivated to continue to work in the employment capacities I have outlined because, for many years, she had to support herself and her children.21. In the late 1990’s, the plaintiff had enrolled at the University of Western Sydney to study a course, which would have led to the degree of Bachelor of Applied Science in the field of diversional therapy. She enrolled in that course in the hope of gaining work in a field that was mentally stimulating for her. She stated that she discontinued the course in 1997 because she needed to return to work to earn wages in order to support herself financially.22. Before her injury the plaintiff had been working for a pharmaceutical factory, packing shampoos and similar goods on a production line. That was full time night work, Monday to Friday. She ceased that work just before Christmas of 2004 in order to travel to Queensland to assist one of her daughters with childcare as her daughter was at that time having family difficulties. Although the plaintiff was not working at the time of her injury, it was clear from her work history that she had an earning capacity that she could have exercised when she became free to do so.Health, social and family circumstances impacting on earning capacity23. In October 1994 the plaintiff suffered a slip and fall injury when she tripped whilst walking on a footpath at night. In that incident, she injured her neck and her back. As a result, she had some time away from her work in a department store. At around this time she was having some emotional difficulties due to marriage problems. Her marriage had broken down and she also had a nervous breakdown. It appears that she had glandular fever at this time as well. The circumstances resulted in the need for the plaintiff to receive psychiatric treatment. These events kept her out of the workforce for a few years. As a consequence of the slip and fall injury, for a time, the plaintiff had some ongoing symptoms concerning her neck and her back.24. Towards the end of 1997, the plaintiff re-entered the workforce and obtained work at a plant nursery, in a full-time casual position serving customers. She said that by this stage, she had ceased experiencing problems with her neck and with her back. She had also ceased receiving psychiatric treatment at around that time, but was still taking antidepressant medication, which she took for a further one and a half years, before ceasing to take it.25. After working in the plant nursery for about 2 years, in order to try something new, the plaintiff took up employment with a major supermarket chain as a console operator at a petrol station working approximately 20-25 hours per week. She held that position for approximately 4 years. In 2003 she switched employment to work as a night packer of a production line for a clothing manufacturer. She worked on night shifts so she could look after her family during the day. She then switched this employment to work night shifts for the pharmaceutical company for which she was carrying out packing work. She ceased this work at Christmas 2004 when she travelled to Queensland to live with one of her daughters at a time of crisis in that daughter’s family.26. In March 2005, each of the plaintiff’s two daughters, who then lived and who are still living in Queensland, had suffered a foot injury. On consecutive days each of them had suffered a foot fracture. As a consequence of these circumstances, the plaintiff took up the responsibility of assisting each of her daughters to run their households and to care for their children.27. Between March 2005 and June 2005, the plaintiff was kept fairly busy looking after her two daughters and her five grandchildren, four of whom were at school.28. Although this remained the position up until the time of the collision, which is the subject of these proceedings, as her daughters were recovering from their injuries, the plaintiff had commenced looking to obtain work just before the motor vehicle collision. She was hoping to be in the workforce within a couple of weeks at around the time the collision occurred, because her daughters were starting to recover from their injuries.29. At the time of the subject collision, the plaintiff was on her way to Sydney to visit her own mother. The plaintiff also stated that it was her intention two live in Queensland to be near her sisters and their children. She stated that she believed that she would have found nightshift employment for 40 hours per week were it not for the collision. At the time of the trial she stated that as a result of the injuries she has received in the collision, she believed she would not be able to go back to her pre-injury employment.Pre-injury work duties30. It is relevant to the claim for loss of earning capacity to review the range of physical activities the plaintiff was accustomed to performing before she was injured.31. When the plaintiff was employed by the printing company, she carried out debt recovery work involving a range of clerical activities. When she worked at the plant nursery she was involved in lifting bags of potting mix, soil, woodchips, fertiliser and the like. When the plaintiff worked at the mail centre she was mainly involved in desk duties and filing in pigeon-holes.32. In her employment for the clothing manufacturer and the pharmaceutical company, where she was performing night packing work, the plaintiff worked full time over the course of five nights a week. In the service station job, she used to operate the dip stick to measure the quantity of petrol in the underground tanks, she did all the daily weekly and monthly paperwork, including running the shop, stock taking, keeping the shelves stocked and the accounting associated with that business.33. The service station job also required her to manipulate a large trolley that had to be pulled out and stacked up with large bottles of oil on a daily basis. This trolley would have to be pulled into the front of the forecourt of the service station. I infer from the description that this was a heavy work task. She also had to take delivery of stock and to bring stock into the shop of the service station and to stock the shelves and refrigerator. This work also involved lifting boxes, placing them in her car, unloading them, including heavy crates of milk.34. When the plaintiff worked as a shoe fitter for the department store, she was required to climb up and down ladders and put away boxes of shoes as well as bringing down boxes of shoes for customers to try. She had hoped to continue with this employment until she retired. She stated that she had planned continuing to work in order to save some money to avoid being dependent on the aged pension.35. It is clear that in the years before her injury in the subject collision, despite her earlier injuries, the plaintiff had a capacity to carry out a relatively unrestricted range of work in a wide range of occupations.36. Since the injury, she has been dependent upon a government disability support pension which she stated was not to her liking.Motor vehicle collision in question37. In the early hours of 29 June 2005, the plaintiff was a passenger in a motor vehicle being driven by her daughter Linda. The vehicle was travelling south along the Pacific Highway near Ballina on the way to Sydney, where the plaintiff was intending to visit her mother. Whilst driving on a muddy section of the roadway, due to sliding the vehicle collided with the trailer portion of a semi-trailer truck travelling in the opposite direction. As a result of the collision the vehicle in which the plaintiff was travelling was crushed to a degree. The defendants have conceded negligence and there is no need to further describe the circumstances of the collision other than to record that the events were extremely shocking to the plaintiff.38. In cross-examination, the plaintiff disagreed with the proposition that the collision simply involved the front of her daughter's vehicle clipping the side of the semitrailer thus causing her daughter's vehicle to start to spin. She agreed that at the scene she declined the suggestion that an ambulance be called. She also agreed that she left Ballina without receiving medical treatment before getting on a plane to travel to Sydney.Plaintiff’s awareness of the events of the collision39. The plaintiff stated that in the events of the collision, she was aware of the approach of the trailer at an angle. She said she was aware of the impact. She stated: “I thought we were dead. I'd could (see) my daughter going to be decapitated.” She closed her eyes whilst the car spun around. She stated that she could hear metal crunching very loudly. She was aware of an airbag having gone off at the driver’s wheel. When she opened her eyes she could see that the vehicle was on the other side of the road, in a ditch and facing north. She said she could not move. For a few minutes she was dizzy from the spinouts of the vehicle and from shock. She said she felt numb and couldn't speak. She said she was aware of her baby granddaughter being taken out from the back of the vehicle.Injuries and immediate effects of injury40. The plaintiff said that following the collision, she was aware of soreness from her head all the way down her body. She said she felt very unwell, was in a lot of pain and felt very sore all over. She described her emotional state as being “terrible”. Her predominant physical problems concerned her neck, head and back. She said she experienced problems with lifting her left arm, difficulty standing up or sitting down and had pain down the back of the leg. She said she had great difficulty showering, dressing and looking after herself. She remained in Sydney for a month, during which time her mother and her mother's carer looked after her. She described her emotional state as being “Not really well.”Treatment and rehabilitation41. Whilst in Sydney, on the day following her injury, the plaintiff consulted a general practitioner, Dr Yap. She stated that he had told her that she “had a whole spinal whiplash”. She stated that whilst she was in Sydney she suffered from bronchitis and was very sick. This apparently impeded her from seeking out medical treatment for her injuries. On her return to Brisbane she saw Dr Zaka, and later, after changing general practitioners, she saw Dr Cotterell. On medical advice she underwent physiotherapy but this was not of much assistance. She said she was also advised to obtain a neck collar and she did this. She subsequently saw another general practitioner, Dr Gunasena.42. The plaintiff’s general practitioner referred her to an orthopaedic surgeon, Dr McCombem, but no active treatment was recommended. She said she has also tried antidepressant medication but has found this does not help. The drug in question, Endep, had caused her to experience side effects, including a feeling of grogginess and an inability to function or think clearly.43. Throughout the remainder of 2005 the plaintiff said she had experienced ongoing problems as described and which were not improving but were worsening.44. The plaintiff stated that shortly before the trial, she saw a Dr Saunders, who had recommended that she take antidepressant medication. She stated that it was her intention to pursue antidepressant treatment.Remaining disabilities45. The plaintiff stated that she currently experiences a lot of pain in her neck. She stated that she cannot completely turn her neck to the left without experiencing pain going down into her shoulder. She also described that pain as radiating down to the left shoulder blade and lower back. She stated that her neck does not feel normal. She stated that the pain never leaves her, even on a good or moderate day, and it gets worse by the evening or earlier in the afternoon depending upon her level of activity. She stated that at its worst, the pain gives her migraines around the vicinity of her ear.46. The plaintiff said that this state had been static for about six months before the trial. She said that she still has pain radiating down her left arm and her neck pain has been constant over the preceding six months. She stated that she still cannot stand for long periods without having to sit down, and this situation is becoming chronic for her. She also stated that she is never free of back pain and it gets worse depending upon the activity in which she is involved. The back pain was described as being in the mid thoracic region and down to the lumbar region. She describes this pain as being intermittent.47. The plaintiff also described experiencing bad nightmares in which she is aware of crashes, voices, metal and involving her daughter. These nightmares commenced straight after the accident and initially occurred every night but now she stated that she experiences these every few weeks, depending upon whether she has been driving or whether she has seen a truck. She has become depressed and suffers from anxiety. Her nightmares affect her sleeping patterns.48. The plaintiff described how her leisure activities have been affected by her injuries. She stated that she can no longer do what she wanted to do. Going to the beach was not the same for her. She was unable to run around on the beach and swim with her grandchildren. She ceased providing assistance to her daughters and her grandchildren. She stated she was unable to resume housework assistance for her daughter. However, she still minds her 9 and 10 year old grandchildren after school whilst her daughter is at work.49. She stated that her ability to do housework, including vacuum cleaning, sweeping and walking is affected by her experience of chronic pain which causes her to become laid up afterward for days or weeks. She stated that she does simple tasks like cleaning her bath, wiping the basin and toilet but finds it difficult to clean the shower. She stated that she is unable to carry out normal shopping tasks and these days only gets “Little bits and pieces”.50. She stated that she experiences some difficulty cooking meals and has to sit down and have breaks when carrying out these tasks.51. In cross-examination, the plaintiff disagreed with the proposition that after the October 1994 injury her neck and back had never returned to the pre-injury state. She denied the defendants’ suggestion that she had a diagnosis of conversion disorder with depressive features after the October 1994 fall. That evidence was not contradicted.52. The plaintiff agreed that in February 2007, when she saw Dr McPhee at the request of the defendants, she had truthfully told him that her symptoms had improved “50 to 60 per cent”. She added that it was difficult to place a range on her condition because it was intermittent and was never the same every day, some days it was worse than others and it was very hard for her to gauge the degree of disability.Post-injury attempts at carrying out work53. The plaintiff agreed that in May 2006 her general practitioner Dr Cotterell suggested she should seek suitable part-time work for up to 8 or 10 hours per week. In compliance with that suggestion, the plaintiff stated that she attempted to do voluntary work for the Red Cross but found she was unable to do this because she could not stand up in order to carry out the task of stapling tags on clothes.54. In cross-examination the plaintiff disagreed with the proposition that as at February 2006, she was able to carry out light work for 12 to 15 hours per week. She agreed that in January 2007 she had participated in a Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service [CRS] functional capacity evaluation with a view to obtaining work. It was through CRS that she obtained a training “lollypop” position directing traffic at pedestrian crossings outside schools but found that she could not pursue that activity.Post-injury activities55. The plaintiff was cross-examined concerning a number of her post-injury activities. She agreed that she could undertake mopping activity in small areas. She stated that if she carried out sweeping she would have to endure after effects. She stated that her ability to carry out vacuuming was dependent upon how her back was at the time, as such activity had after effects for her back. She agreed that she could carry out cooking activities but qualified this by saying that she had to sit down and have rests. She agreed that she had tried to carry out a larger shopping. She stated that she could sometimes prepare family meals. She stated that when she did the laundry she experienced pain. She carried out washing for her grandchildren every day.DVD showing selected activities56. The plaintiff was shown some DVD sequences taken on 23 January 2007 at the request of the defendants : Exhibit “3”. She agreed that those sequences showed she was driving. She denied that she had no difficulty driving. These sequences also showed her carrying some shopping parcels. She stated that she experienced great difficulty in reaching into a supermarket freezer bin to select items as was shown on the DVD. She agreed that she could push a shopping trolley but did not agree that this was something she could do without difficulty.57. The plaintiff agreed that the DVD showed she was able to drive to the shops from her daughter's home. This involves a journey of some 25 minutes in the car. She disagreed with the suggestion that this was something she could do without difficulty. She stated that at the time when the DVD sequences were filmed, she was taking medicine every day in order to assist her to cope.58. When specifically questioned on her ability two manipulate a full laden shopping trolley, she pointed out that her daughter usually pulled this as well. She also stated that such activity caused her to suffer pain. She described her pain as occurring every day to different degrees, escalating with activity. She was shown some DVD film of collecting some shopping out of the back of a hatchback vehicle. When cross-examined about her ability to drive for 25 minutes to the shopping centre, she stated that she could do so because she took frequent sit and rest breaks, and usually took more medication.Plaintiff’s daughter – Mrs Mellissa Jones59. Mrs Melissa Jones, a daughter of the plaintiff, gave evidence of the plaintiff’s pre-injury and post-injury status.60. Mrs Jones was taken to the events of the 1990’s when her mother had fallen on a footpath and had injured herself. At that time Mrs Jones was aged about 25 or 26 years and was living in Queensland but said she used to visit her mother a lot in Sydney.61. It was against that background that she described her mother as having had some physical and emotional problems before the motor vehicle collision but she encapsulated this by stating that when the plaintiff moved to Queensland she moved by herself and without assistance.62. Mrs Jones confirmed the effect of the evidence given by the plaintiff that in March 2005, both she and her sister had suffered foot injuries. Before those foot injuries she described the plaintiff as having looked after her and her two children by taking full responsibility for the running of the home, in addition to helping her other sister and children, who lived some five minutes drive by car from her home.63. Mrs Jones described her knowledge of the plaintiff’s pre-injury activities. She stated that before her injuries in 2005, the plaintiff did a lot of housework for her, including a lot of heavy lifting around the house, cooking, vacuuming, washing and “everything”. She described her mother as being a very able person, capable of doing many things before the injury. She described her mother as being very well and very stable before the injuries in question.64. Mrs Jones learned about the injury to her mother at about 4.00am on the morning in question but did not see her mother until about six weeks afterwards, by which time she had returned to Queensland in what she described as a very debilitated state. Mrs Jones had the perception of the plaintiff at that time as being in a lot of pain, crying a lot and complaining of pain and discomfort. She described the plaintiff as having been very depressed on her return to Queensland. She observed the plaintiff to have been consumed with pain and restricted in her activities.65. Mrs Jones described the plaintiff as doing very little around the house in the early period after her injury, and still having restrictions at the present time even though from time to time she attempts to undertake aspects of housework until it appears to cause her pain.66. Mrs Jones described how, since the injury in question, after her own recuperation following her foot injury, that is by about October 2005, she was providing her mother with domestic assistance comprising cleaning and cooking, clearing up, food preparation, washing, hanging washing, sorting the dried washing, folding and ironing, and shopping, for about 15 or 16 hours per week after the injury. Mrs Jones stated that she carried out quite a number of household tasks for the plaintiff of this nature for about 18 months. The evidence as to the nature, extent and time involved concerning these domestic activities was difficult to clearly interpret. Mrs Jones conceded that some of the work that involved domestic activity to assist the plaintiff was also provided for the benefit of other household members.67. Significantly, Mrs Jones was able to describe the detail of the activities that were shown on the DVD that was taken by investigators acting on behalf of the defendants. She confirmed that the cereal boxes which the plaintiff was shown to have carried under her left arm whilst walking up the access way to the house were not heavy at all. She also confirmed that she had herself carried the groceries from the car up the driveway into the house because her mother couldn’t carry awkward things up the steep access. Mrs Jones stated that whilst she and her mother lived together for the present time, her plans were to move away from Queensland and to live with her boyfriend in South Australia where he had obtained work.68. Significantly, Mrs Jones denied the suggestion that her mother had not ever really recovered from the stressful emotional condition she suffered after being injured in 1994. She also denied that the plaintiff’s emotional problems that had arisen after the 2005 motor vehicle collision had improved.Plaintiff’s sister – Mrs Lorraine Holloway69. Mrs Lorraine Holloway, the plaintiff’s sister, gave evidence concerning the plaintiff’s pre-injury status, which included her work history as well as her physical and psychological health. The perspective from which she gave this evidence was her familiarity with the plaintiff before her injuries and her contact with the plaintiff every six months since the injury, and regular telephone contact, at least monthly.70. Mrs Holloway described how, when the plaintiff was in Sydney, she took her to a chiropractor for back massage and for x-rays. She conceded that she did not have a day-to-day relationship with the plaintiff because of the geographical separation between them, the plaintiff residing in Queensland.71. Mrs Holloway described the plaintiff as being a very active, energetic and happy person, a good homemaker who also gardened and entertained, who had a lot of friends, who worked hard, including in physical occupations. She described the plaintiff as having had “her life back together” after the 1994 fall and before the 2005 injury.72. Mrs Holloway described the plaintiff’s physical state as having deteriorated between 2005 and the present time. She stated that she had observed the plaintiff had become very rigid in her movements, did not go out very often and took painkilling medication. She described a change in the plaintiff’s personality, accompanied by depression, chronic pain, unhappiness and loss of interest. She conveyed the impression that the plaintiff had appeared to have aged somewhat since being injured in the collision. Mrs Holloway had not noticed a lot of improvement in the plaintiff’s physical and emotional state in the year or so before the trial.73. Mrs Holloway denied she was tailoring her evidence to assist the plaintiff’s case.Medical evidence74. In the paragraphs that follow I set out my review of the medical evidence. That review involves the treatment reports, medical investigation reports, CRS reports, and reports and records obtained by the respective solicitors for the parties.Treatment reports75. The plaintiff has been assessed and treated by general practitioners, a chiropractor, a physiotherapist and an orthopaedic surgeon.Dr Yap – first treating general practitioner in Sydney76. On 30 June 2005, after her arrival in Sydney on the day following the collision the plaintiff consulted Dr Robert Yap, a general practitioner. Dr Yap provided a report dated 30 May 2007 in which he outlined his clinical contact with the plaintiff. He took a history of the plaintiff complaining of neck, shoulder and lower back pain. He diagnosed her as suffering from a whiplash type injury to the neck and lower back. He prescribed Naprosyn for pain and recommended physiotherapy. Following the plaintiff’s return to Queensland at the end of July 2005, she again returned to see Dr Yap on a couple of occasions when she was in Sydney in February and October of 2006, at which time he provided her with prescriptions.Dr Mudbidri – medical practitioner and chiropractor77. On 7 July 2005 the plaintiff saw Dr Samantha Mudbidri, a medical practitioner who was also a chiropractor. She carried out a three level examination of her spine on that occasion. Dr Mudbidri noted abnormalities of spinal tilting and curvature at various levels. The report does not offer any opinion on whether or not these observations were due to muscle spasm. It appears this referral was at the request of Mr Jamal Sabsabi, a chiropractor. Mr Sabsabi’s notes reveal a record of the plaintiff having complained of moderate pain and restriction of movement in the cervical spine and severe pain and restriction of movement in the lumbar spine. A diagrammatic representation of the plaintiff’s complaints show the affected areas to have been the right side of the face, the left clavicular and scapular regions and the thoraco-lumbar spines. It is not possible to interpret the symbol notations that were employed by Mr Sabsabi to record the findings on examination.Dr Zaka – general practitioner78. On 1 and 2 August 2005, following her return to Queensland at the end of July 2005, the plaintiff attended the Beenleigh After Hours Medical Centre where she was seen by Dr Tabinda Zaka who took a history that included intermittent complaints of low back pain and improved neck pain. A diagnosis of whiplash injury was made. Heat packs and analgesia were recommended as treatment. The plaintiff was advised not to undertake any heavy lifting, pulling or pushing activities.Dr Cotterell – general practitioner79. On 11 August 2005, the plaintiff saw Dr Sue Cotterell, a general practitioner. Dr Cotterell referred the plaintiff to Mr Hewitt for physiotherapy treatment. Dr Cotterell arranged for a CT scan to be obtained of the plaintiff’s lumbo-sacral spine. I will refer to the findings of those scans in my summary of the medical investigations that were undertaken on the plaintiff. 80. Dr Cotterell prepared a report dated 31 May 2006 in which she summarised the history and her clinical contact with the plaintiff. She stated that when she first saw the plaintiff on 11 August 2005 she was complaining of nightmares related to be collision and was having difficulty sitting or standing for any length of time and had pain down her legs, mainly on the right side. Dr Cotterell noted her findings on examination, which included restricted movements of the neck and back with tenderness across the shoulders and spine. She diagnosed a musculo-ligamentous soft tissue injury to the neck, upper shoulders, thoracic and lumbar spines.81. Dr Cotterell also noted the plaintiff needed analgesia for muscle spasm and pain. In November 2005 she noted that the plaintiff was limping when walking and was experiencing a number of symptoms which included left facial and left arm numbness, left-sided neck pain, limitation of back movements and decreased sensation in the left leg. She also reported that the plaintiff was continuing to suffer from back pain and was stooped over after 10 minutes of walking. After arranging for investigations and trials of various medications, Dr Cotterell referred the plaintiff to Dr McCombe, an orthopaedic surgeon. She also prescribed exercise and hydrotherapy.82. Dr Cotterell stated that she suspected the plaintiff would have ongoing back and neck pain and sciatica of an intermittent nature. In May 2006 she felt it was too early to give a definitive opinion as treatment may have helped and, by inference, may possibly continue to be of help in alleviating the plaintiff’s symptoms.83. Dr Cotterell’s report stated that the plaintiff would be able to start part-time work providing suitable employment could be got for 8 to 10 hours per week, not involving sitting or standing for any length of time, no lifting of weights heavier than 5 kgs, or lifting anything above the shoulders, perhaps doing office work, provided it was not of a repetitive nature.84. Dr Cotterell stated that she did not feel there was any overlying functional or psychosomatic component to the plaintiff’s presentation. She noted that the plaintiff was assiduously attending physiotherapy and doing the prescribed exercises. She noted the plaintiff reported experiencing anger and nightmares. She noted that the plaintiff had “up” days and “down” days. She stated that she considered the plaintiff’s presentation to be a normal reaction of a person who had been fit and well and who was having ongoing back pain resulting from injuries sustained in the collision.Dr McCombe – treating orthopaedic surgeon85. On 7 November 2005 the plaintiff was seen for assessment and treatment by Dr McCombe, an orthopaedic surgeon. Dr McCombe saw the plaintiff again on 28 August 2006 for the purpose of preparing a report for the plaintiff’s solicitor. That report was dated 24 August 2006.86. At the first consultation in 2005, Dr McCombe took a history of post-injury neck and low back problems and pain radiating into the left shoulder and left leg, these symptoms having begun about 2 days after the injury. He also recorded a history of left-sided headaches and worsening of the low back pain with lifting activities. He noted the plaintiff was taking Digesic and diazepam. There is no dispute that these respective medications are for pain relief in the case of Digesic, and for muscle relaxation or as a calmative, in the case of diazepam. 87. At his first consultation, Dr McCombe noted on examination that the plaintiff’s whole spine was stiff and painful. He noted extension movements were difficult and painful. He noted tenderness in the mid-cervical, lower thoracic and the whole of the lumbar regions. He reviewed the radiology scans and identified a left sided foraminal disc protrusion at the L3/4 level. He recommended conservative treatment.88. At the consultation on 23 August 2006, Dr McCombe took an updated history from the plaintiff in which he recorded pain in the left shoulder girdle, left and right buttocks, intermittent radiation into the left leg, and intermittent sensations of pins and needles in her hands. He recorded that she complained of aggravation of these problems on standing for more than 15 minutes. He noted the complaint of difficulty sitting for more than half an hour and walking for about 750m. He noted the complaint of difficulty with domestic tasks. He noted the plaintiff’s intake of 12 paracetamol tablets per day, 2-4 Nurofen tablets per day and the occasional dose of Mersyndol. He observed a positive left femoral stretch test in his examination.89. Dr McCombe diagnosed the plaintiff as having had a whiplash injury of the whole spine with pain experienced particularly in the thoracic and lumbar spines. He stated that no treatment was likely to modify the outcome of the condition. He also stated that the plaintiff would require intermittent analgesia, probably of the paracetamol and codeine type, in the foreseeable future. Although he identified a possibility of some minor improvement over the ensuing 12 months, he stated that the prognosis was for long-term pain. He expressed pessimism about the plaintiff being able to find any job for which she would be suited, and which she would be able to do, noting that she was clearly not fit to return to her previous employment as a warehouse packer.90. Significantly, Dr McCombe observed that the plaintiff was not coping well with her pain. He was cautious not to apply the label of psychosomatic functional disorder or abnormal illness behaviour because it was important to understand, that it was likely in his view, that the plaintiff was suffering from an underlying organic injury.Mr Hewitt - physiotherapist91. On 15 August 2005, at the referral of Dr Cotterell, the plaintiff first consulted Mr Scott Hewitt, a physiotherapist. Mr Hewitt asked the plaintiff to complete a questionnaire concerning her presenting state of health.92. The plaintiff’s responses to the questionnaire indicated to Mr Hewitt that she had taken painkilling medication without effect on the pain. She indicated that she found it painful to look after herself, could only lift light weights, she spent most of the day in bed or in a chair, pain prevented her from sitting for more than 10 minutes and standing for more than 10 minutes, she slept less than 2 hours even with medication, pain had restricted her social life, her pain was getting neither better nor worse, and she was restricted with travelling for more than half an hour.93. Mr Hewitt informed the CTP insurer that he found objective evidence that the plaintiff was in a flexed position when he examined her, at which time she was “10-15º off straight”. Mr Hewitt did not indicate which part he was considering when he wrote those remarks however, I infer from the recorded remarks regarding the subjective symptoms to the lumbar spine, the neck, fatigue and pain in both legs, that he was referring to the spine. 94. Mr Hewitt formulated a treatment plan that involved mobilisation and stability exercises with the aim of achieving a full range of movement over the course of a number of weeks of recommended treatment. Mr Hewitt’s notes were in evidence but were poorly copied and difficult to read. His record card indicated that there were at least 14 treatments administered to the plaintiff before he noted his card with the words “Allianz will not pay”, at which time his treatment appeared to have stopped.Medical investigations95. The plaintiff has a number of medical investigations of her post-injury problems.96. On 12 August 2005 Dr Landy carried out a CT scan examination of the plaintiff’s lumbosacral spine at the request of Dr Cotterell. This was reported as showing postero-lateral disc protrusion/herniation at the L4/5 level on the left involving the inferior aspect and lateral to the intervertebral foramen. The CT scan was also reported as showing that at the level L4/5 there was an annulus disc bulging indenting the anterior aspect of the thecal sac, more prominent on the left than on the right, with some degenerative changes at the apophyseal joints.97. On 7 February 2006 Dr Landy carried out further CT scanning of the lumbosacral spine due to left and right-sided sciatica and buttock pain. He reported that at the L3/4 level there was some lateral disc bulging with some focal protrusion postero-laterally on the left and narrowing of the intervertebral foramen inferiorly. At the L4/5 level he reported some annulus disc bulging evident with slight flattening of the anterior aspect of the thecal sac. He again noted degenerative change in the apophyseal joints. At the L5/S1 level he noted some annulus disc bulging and decrease in vertebral disc height.98. On 3 November 2006 Dr Dunn was asked to undertake further CT scanning of the lumbosacral spine. The background history was that of low back pain, radiating down both legs and a previous focal disc protrusion at L3/4. His findings indicated an increased lumber lordosis and forward sacral tilt which he indicated could lead to significant instability and early degeneration within the lower lumbar facet joints. He noted the presence of disc bulging at the levels previously reported upon, and he indicated that the appearance was probably not significantly changed from the previous scans.99. On 22 May 2009 Dr de Silva undertook CT scanning of the plaintiff’s cervical spine. He noted some facet joint degeneration at the C2/3 facet. He also noted mild disc herniation posteriorly at the C3/4 level. There was also left sided C 3/4 facet joint degeneration.100. On 25 May 2009 Dr Ho reported upon MRI scanning of the plaintiffs lumbar spine. The clinical history was that of an acute exacerbation of chronic low back pain. The conclusion following the scanning was L4/5 and L5/S1 facet arthrosis. Abnormalities were also noted at the levels L1/2, being a depression deformity of the L2 endplate indicating interosseous disc herniation and L4/5 posterior disc bulging.101. On 25 May 2009 Dr Nguyen reported on a whole-body study SPECT scan. Clinical indication for this was chronic lower back pain, thoracic and cervical pain with acute exacerbations. Arthritic changes were noted in various parts of the body, including in the neck and back.Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service reports102. On 9 January 2007 Centrelink referred the plaintiff to the CRS for a job capacity assessment report. It was difficult to form a complete view of that assessment because only three of the nine pages of the report were tendered. 103. Part of the CRS report acknowledged that for the plaintiff to cope with work-related stress and pressures, she would need some work capacity support for a duration of longer than 24 months, whatever that meant. In the general assessment summary of the report, on the assumption that the plaintiff’s disability “can be partially compensated for, or accommodated by the provision of disability specific intervention … it is anticipated the client will have a future capacity for work of 8-14 hours per week in an open employment situation.” It was noted that the assessor thought the plaintiff would benefit from continuing to participate in vocational rehabilitation and that she would continue to benefit from continuing with her current treatment for her pain. The qualifications of the author of the report were not stated and the author gave no acknowledgement of the expert witness code.104. On 5 December 2007 the plaintiff underwent a functional capacity evaluation concerning the chronic pain experienced in her back, her hip, her neck and her shoulder. That assessment was originally commenced on 5 January 2007 but, owing to the irritability of the plaintiff’s condition on that date, a follow-up appointment was booked for 14 May 2007, when “her condition was less irritable”. The assessment was carried out, on behalf of the CRS by Mr Anton Nguyen, a physiotherapist. The report summarised the plaintiff’s reported limitations in her ability to carry out the activities of daily living. The history was summarised as follows: 
     
     “…She reports significant restrictions with vacuuming, washing, ironing, shopping and gardening. She has moderate restrictions with cooking, cleaning, making the bed and looking after her grandchild. She has slight restrictions with self care such as cutting her toenails and shaving her legs. Helen reports that she has trouble with sleeping. She takes sleeping tablets on a regular basis to help her sleep. Her sleeping averages 3-4 hours a night. Helen is unable to return to sleep when she wakes up due to pain. She reports that she is able to sit for 30 minutes. Stand for 5-10 minutes. Lift up to 4 kg and carry 2kg. Helen reports that she is unable to drive a manual car, due to flare up of back and hp ain. She is able to drive an automatic car for 2-30 minutes. Helen reports occasional difficulty with stairs.” 
    105. The physical symptoms of back pain, sciatica, shoulder and neck pain and related headaches were reviewed, as were the recorded flare-ups of the condition that the plaintiff was experiencing whilst attempting to do some volunteer work.106. The vocational assessment was framed in terms of statistical descriptors “Based on the summary of definitions of work and physical demand characteristics.” The meaning of this expression was not explained. Qualified in that way, the author of the report expressed the opinion that the plaintiff would be able to work in a retail/sales position as long as it did not involve lifting more than 3 kgs. It was noted that she was suitable for sedentary work with no lifting of anything greater than 3 kgs “on a rare basis”.  Other job restrictions were also noted concerning the ability to change positions frequently and to allow time for stretching. The report concluded that the plaintiff would benefit from job training or a gradual return to work programme to improve her physical work tolerance and to monitor her progress. Clearly, the report was inconclusive and was not intended to be a definitive assessment of the plaintiff’s capacity to work.Reports obtained by plaintiff’s solicitor107. The solicitor for the plaintiff obtained a number of medico-legal assessments and reports. These are summarised in the paragraphs that follow.Dr Peter Conrad – consultant surgeon108. On 16 February 2006, at the request of her solicitors, the plaintiff was examined by Dr Peter Conrad, a consultant surgeon. Dr Conrad’s report of that consultation was dated 17 February 2006. In that report, after reviewing the plaintiff’s history, and recording his findings on examination, which included the presence of moderate paravertebral muscle spasm, a restriction of spinal and related movements, with hyer-reflexia in the left leg, Dr Conrad expressed the view that the plaintiff had sustained a significant whiplash injury of the neck, left shoulder strain and a back strain, associated with a disc prolapse as was shown on the CT scan. He also noted left-sided sciatica. He suggested the need for ongoing physiotherapy on an as needed basis. Dr Conrad expressed the view that the plaintiff was fit for only light work, starting at about 12-15 hours per week but perhaps very likely as part of a structured rehabilitation programme. He predicted that she should (after participating in that programme) be in a position where she would be able to stand or sit at will, and lift anything more than 5 kgs in weight or do repetitive lifting or bending. He stated that she would not be able to lift her left arm above shoulder level and she would not be able to do “full on process work or factory work”. In his view the plaintiff’s prognosis was uncertain at the time.109. At the request of her solicitors, Dr Conrad examined the plaintiff again on 28 May 2009. The report following that consultation was dated 29 May 2009. After reviewing her history again, Dr Conrad noted the plaintiff had more limitation of movement in all directions of her cervical spine due to pain. He also noted the presence of a paravertebral muscle spasm and a loss of range of movement in an asymmetrical fashion. His examination of the plaintiffs’ lumbar spine noted moderate paravertebral muscle spasm was present. Dr Conrad reviewed the radiology evidence as set out on page 2 of this report. In addition to reiterating his earlier conclusions with regard to the plaintiff’s potential to do about 12-15 hours per week of light work, with the qualifications on her ability to stand or sit at will and with lifting restrictions, he also stated that she should not use heavy industrial vacuum cleaners and polishers. He stated that the work that he foreshadowed in this regard should be part of a structured rehabilitation programme. He also noted that if the plaintiff’s daughter was not available to assist with the heavier parts of housework, she might need about 6 hours per week of home care assistance.Dr Thomas Clark – consultant psychiatrist110. On 16 August 2007, at the request of her solicitors, the plaintiff was examined by Dr Thomas Clark, a consultant psychiatrist. Dr Clark’s report of that consultation was dated 2 September 2007. In his report, Dr Clark set out the history of the events provided by the plaintiff of the collision, and characterised this as akin to a near death experience for the plaintiff. He noted the history of her development of insomnia, hypervigilance and an inability to relax. He noted that she had developed pain and also considerable psychiatric distress and many symptoms of a traumatised state. He characterised this distress as having become chronic, and evolved into a chronic depression known as dysthymia. He noted that the plaintiff had low self-esteem and no-confidence, and that this interfered with her life such that at times, she was overtly depressed and crying.111. Dr Clark stated that the plaintiff presented with the signs and symptoms of an anxiety state. He diagnosed her as having post-traumatic stress disorder with depression to the point that she developed an anxiety state, panic attacks and become chronically depressed and withdrawn. In his view, the depression, which has been evident for a long time, was caused by the collision. He recommended that she should see a psychiatrist for treatment. Within the parameters of the DSM IV, he characterised her diagnosis as being a dysthymic disorder. In his opinion this disorder had reached a state of maximal medical improvement. He stated that there was no evidence of a pre-existing condition.112. On 29 May 2009, the plaintiff was re-examined by Dr Clark. His report following that examination was dated 2 June 2009. After reviewing the earlier history, Dr Clark noted that the plaintiff was hypersensitive to touch even to the point of no longer going to a hairdresser but rather, a short visit to a barber. In his view the plaintiff exhibited signs and symptoms of an anxiety state. He noted that her earlier presentation of hypersensitivity had caused her to develop avoidance strategies, including to the point where she did not read much or watch disturbing television programs. Dr Clark reiterated his earlier diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder with depression. He characterised the disorder as being chronic.Medical materials and reports obtained by solicitor for defendants113. The defendants tendered the clinical notes and records of three of the plaintiff’s treating general practitioners, as well as reports from a specialist spinal surgeon, a psychiatrist and an occupational therapist. Within the clinical records tendered by the defendants there was also a report from a specialist in musculoskeletal medicine. That report was commissioned by the Motor Accidents Authority to determine the nature and extent of the plaintiff’s injuries.Records of Dr Zaka – treating general practitioner114. Copies of the clinical records were tendered by the defendants relating to the plaintiff and produced on subpoena by Dr Tabinda Zaka. These records consisted of clinical progress notes for medical consultations covering the period between 1 August 2005 and 29 January 2007, which was after the plaintiff obtained some initial medical assistance in Sydney. The first entry in the records of Dr Zaka concerned a consultation on 1 August 2005 following the plaintiff’s return to Queensland from Sydney. Dr Zaka noted the history of a whiplash injury involving the neck and back. In my view, there was nothing in these records that could be read as being contradictory of the plaintiff’s claim.Records of Dr Cotterell – treating general practitioner115. Copies of the clinical records relating to the plaintiff and produced on subpoena by Dr Sue Cotterell were tendered by the defendants. These records were paginated and comprised some 90 pages. The records comprised consultations with Dr Cotterell and other medical practitioners in her practice, and spanned the period 18 June 2004 to 28 May 2007.116. Whilst these voluminous records obviously include consultations for matters unrelated to the subject injury, in my view they also contain records of medical consultations sought by the plaintiff relating to her post-injury problems and her need for painkilling medication, along with related referrals. The purpose behind the defendants’ tender of these records was not clear. In my view there was nothing in these records that could be read as being contradictory of the plaintiff’s claim.Records of Dr Gunasena – treating general practitioner117. Copies of the clinical records were tendered by the defendants relating to the plaintiff and produced on subpoena by Dr Lalitha Gunasena. These records consisted of clinical progress notes for medical consultations covering the period 17 January 2007 and 21 December 2007. Whilst some of the consultations concerned unrelated matters, these records documented the occasional prescription of painkilling medication and the complaints of long-term neck, back and shoulder pain. In my view there was nothing in these records that could be read as being contradictory of the plaintiff’s claim.Dr Peter Jackson – specialist in musculo-skeletal medicine118. Dr Gunasena’s records included copies of certificates of determination dated 5 March 2007, issued following medical assessment of the plaintiff on 2 March 2007 by Dr Peter Jackson, a specialist in musculoskeletal medicine. He was engaged by the Motor Accidents Authority Medical Assessment Service to examine the plaintiff to determine the nature of her injuries, the cause of those injuries, the degree of stability of the effects of those injuries, and the degree of permanent impairment that remained as a consequence of those injuries.119. Dr Jackson reviewed the plaintiff’s complaints, took a history from her and reviewed a number of radiology scans. The complaints made by the plaintiff to him essentially related to her neck, lower back and left shoulder. She complained of continuing to suffer left-sided neck pain, particularly on movement and referred pain, particularly in the region of the left shoulder. Dr Jackson also noted the history of left gluteal pain that is invariably present. He also noted complaints of frequent insomnia and fatigue and the need to take analgesic medication.120. Dr Jackson also noted the plaintiff’s complaint of impairment concerning activities of daily living, comprising activities such as bathing, grooming, dressing, eating, reading, writing, using keyboard, standing, sitting, declining, walking, stooping, squatting, kneeling, reaching, bending, twisting, leaning, carrying, lifting, pushing, pulling, grasping, holding, pinching, driving and participating in sports or hobbies other than walking.121. Dr Jackson’s findings on clinical examination of the plaintiff’s neck revealed a slightly protracted posture, tenderness, asymmetry, reduced motion and increased muscle guarding between left-sided C5/6/7 and tender muscle induration of the left trapezius, sternocleidomastoid and scalene group of muscles.122. Dr Jackson’s findings on clinical examination of the plaintiff’s lumbar spine revealed left pelvic obliquity or non-parallel muscle arrangement, with side bending the lumbar spine to the right and rotated to the left. He noted that palpation of the lumbar spine revealed painful induration of the left-sided paravertebral and gluteal muscles.123. Dr Jackson reviewed medical reports and certificates from Dr Yap, Dr Cotterell and Dr McCombe in addition to the radiology scans provided to him.124. Dr Jackson concluded that his clinical findings were consistent with the plaintiff’s injuries and history, and that the findings on examination were internally consistent. In his diagnosis, the plaintiff had aggravation of pre-existing degenerative change at the C3/4 and C4/5 levels of the cervical spine, lumbar spine injuries comprising left-sided paranormal disc protrusion at L3/4, L3/4 and lateral L3/4 disc bulge and L4/5 disc bulge and protrusion.125. Dr Jackson considered that all of the complaints of injuries, namely to the neck, lower back and lumbar spine, and the left shoulder strain, were caused by the collision in question, with the proviso that he thought that on the balance of probabilities the various disc lesions were pre-existing. He did not think that there were any complaints made by the plaintiff which were unrelated to the collision in question.Associate Professor McPhee – consultant spinal surgeon126. The plaintiff was seen by Associate Professor Bruce McPhee on two occasions at the request of the defendants. As a consequence, Associate Professor McPhee produced two reports following his examinations of the plaintiff. He also produced some follow-up correspondence with the solicitors for the defendants in answer to questions that had been asked of him. This material was tendered by the defendants.127. Associate Professor McPhee is an orthopaedic surgeon. He noted that his clinical practice was exclusively in spinal surgery.128. The first report of Associate Professor McPhee was dated 19 February 2007 and related to an examination of the plaintiff by him on 14 February 2007. After taking a history of the incident and of her current clinical complaints, which related to the neck, the scapular region and the low back, he also noted that the plaintiff took prescription and non-prescription medication daily, and that she had difficulty with household and domestic tasks. He also noted that she was currently attending the CRS and was not working. He reviewed the radiology scans and noted the degenerative changes in the facet joints at C3/4 and C4/5, as well as a prominent left postero-lateral bulge at the L3/4 disc as well as minor posterior bulging at the L4/5 and L5/S1 disc. He also noted a moderate degree of degenerative change in all facet joints, most marked at the L4/5 level.129. Associate Professor McPhee stated his opinion that, on the balance of probabilities, the pre-existing degenerative changes in the neck and back have been aggravated by the road traffic injury due to soft tissue strains. He did not explain how he undertook the weighing of the relevant factors that enabled him to reach that balanced conclusion. He referred to statistical studies concerning the course over which such injuries take to improve, noting that a small proportion of patients continued to have symptoms long-term. Associate Professor McPhee acknowledged that it was reasonable to assume that the plaintiff may have an incapacity for the most robust and heavy tasks of domestic work.130. Associate Professor McPhee stated that the plaintiff had suffered a soft tissue strain of the neck and back which, based on statistically scaled instruments of relative measurement, classified her “as having a minor disability”. With regard to the consistency of the plaintiff’s presentation in the consultation he stated : 
     
     “ 
     Consistency of Presentation 
      
      
     It was demonstrated during the examination that the claimant’s range of lumbar spine movements was not consistent with her full capabilities. This casts some doubt on the validity of any observation relating to the range of movements in her neck and lumbar spines. Other than these findings no other significant inconsistencies were noted. These observations do not constitute abnormal illness behaviour. Although there is no evidence of significant functional overlay, I suspect there is a level of stress which is tending to dictate the level (sic) activities she undertakes.” 
    131. Associate Professor McPhee did not explain which of the particular lumbar spinal movements was not consistent with the plaintiff’s full capabilities. Therefore, it is not possible to rationally analyse or fully determine the probative value of his statement that sought to cast some doubt on the validity of observations made relating to the range of movements in the plaintiff’s neck and back. This aspect of his opinion was clouded by the limited nature of his explanation. His statement appears to have been based on inconsistencies he said he observed in relation to lumbar spine movements. He claimed that this cast doubt on the validity of observations relating not only to the movements of the lumbar spine, but also concerning the neck movements. However, the nexus of his observations concerning the lumbar spine as relating to the neck remained unexplained.132. On 18 March 2009 Associate Professor McPhee re-examined the plaintiff at the request of the solicitor for the defendants. He produced a report of that consultation which was dated 19 March 2009. In updating the clinical history following this consultation, he noted that although there had been some 50-60 per cent improvement in symptoms from the time of injury to the time of the last consultation the plaintiff had with him, on 2 February 2007, there had been no improvement since. The plaintiff’s symptoms still related to the neck, the left shoulder, the back, and right buttock pain. The history of denial of any past history of medical low back pain was confirmed.133. In his second consultation, Associate Professor McPhee noted the range of the plaintiff’s lumbar spine movements was generally reduced. He also noted that there was a general reduction in all movements of the neck. He also noted that the left shoulder showed restricted elevation by flexion or adduction. He reviewed radiology scans and noted abnormalities concerning lordosis and kyphosis but did not comment on whether or not these were underlying problems or whether they were postural issues to do with muscle spasm or guarding, or otherwise.134. Following his second consultation he reiterated his earlier view that there had been an aggravation of pre-existing cervical and lumbar degenerative changes due to a whiplash injury that occurred on 29 June 2005. He then referred to the statistical prognosis of such injuries and noted that in all long-term studies, between 40 per cent and 70 per cent of patients may have ongoing symptoms, including neck, shoulder, low back and leg pain.135. Associate Professor McPhee stated that it was conceivable that the plaintiff may have a functional incapacity for robust physical tasks or manual activities above shoulder level, these tasks including bending, lifting, carrying and pushing. However, he stated that there was nothing on examination which he thought would preclude her from undertaking sedentary work which may include some light or occasional moderately physical tasks. He qualified this statement to depend upon the plaintiff’s ability to tolerate pain when she undertakes such activities. He referred to the phenomenon of psychological and social factors which may serve to reinforce invalidity. Considering her age, and her qualifications and ongoing disability, he predicted that the probability of the plaintiff finding suitable employment would be low, or virtually zero.136. In considering the plaintiff’s presentation at the consultation, Associate Professor McPhee softened his earlier statement casting doubt on the validity of his observations concerning range of movements of the neck and back. In this regard, in his 2009 report he stated: 
     
     “ 
     Consistency of Presentation 
      
      
     The claimant’s presentation is consistent with the history and radiological findings. The level of incapacity may be a little more than might be anticipated given her clinical and radiological findings. Although there is no clinical evidence of significant functional overlay, there is a level of stress which is tending to dictate the level of activities Ms Matthews is prepared to undertake.” 
    137. Associate Professor McPhee was provided with further information by correspondence. The letters from the solicitor for the defendants that generated this correspondence were not tendered in evidence.138. On 13 May 2009 Associate Professor McPhee wrote an explanatory letter to the solicitor for the defendants, confirming that in his opinion, according to the applicable statistical instruments and measurement of impairment, the combined impairment of both the cervical and lumbar spine in the plaintiff was 10 per cent of the individual as a whole.139. On 6 July 2009 Associate Professor McPhee undertook a review of the reports of Dr Conrad and some of the radiological reports that I have already reviewed. In his letter of 6 July 2009 he sought to imply that the examination carried out by Dr Conrad was inadequate because it was exceptionally brief concerning its description of examinations of the spine and made no reference to cross-checking of findings under distraction, compared to his own examination technique. In the absence of explanatory evidence concerning the reliability or unreliability of one examination technique compared to another, I am not prepared to speculate on whether or not such a criticism is valid. 140. In his 6 July 2009 letter, Associate Professor McPhee considered that any restrictions in the plaintiff’s left shoulder movements were pain related and were referred from the cervical spine rather than due to localised shoulder pathology. For the purpose of these proceedings is not necessary that I attempt to reconcile any debate between Associate Professor McPhee and Dr Conrad as to any differences they may hold concerning the appropriate statistical measurement percentage impairment, concerning the cervical spine in the absence of left shoulder pathology. For the purposes of assessment in this case, it is sufficient to have regard to the complaints, the history and questions of diagnosis, rather than to refer to statistical descriptors.Dr Angelo Virgona – consultant psychiatrist141. On 13 April 2009, at the request of the solicitor for the defendants, the plaintiff was examined by Dr Angelo Virgona, a consultant psychiatrist. Following a one hour consultation with the plaintiff, Dr Virgona issued his report to the solicitor for the defendants on the same day. Dr Virgona took a history of the occurrence of the incident, the course of subsequent events relating to injury, treatment and disability, and focused on the psychological issues.142. Dr Virgona noted that after the incident in question the plaintiff became afraid of trucks on the road and had lasting nightmares, but these became less frequent. He noted that she had explained how she had learnt to cope with these problems on her own, without psychological help.143. On specific questioning, Dr Virgona elicited that the plaintiff’s concentration becomes affected by pain, she experiences occasional anger, she has had panic attacks at the sight of trucks on the road, such attacks being accompanied by palpitations and hyperventilation and these days, when she feels the onset of anxiety she is able to talk herself out of it, and calms down. He noted the past history of nervous breakdown in 1994, in association with a marital breakdown, a fall, the occurrence of glandular fever, early menopause, depression and the excessive use of sedatives for a brief period. He noted that these events had resulted in three brief hospitalisations, which were secondary to suicide attempts. Following the receipt of psychiatric treatment for 12 months, and following the taking of prescribed antidepressants, she had no further such problems.144. Dr Virgona noted that at the time of his examination, that the plaintiff was taking Panadeine Forte tablets, between two and six times a day as prescribed, together with Stilnox for sleep, Nurofen for pain and diazepam for her back.145. Dr Virgona a reviewed the plaintiff’s medical, family and personal history. He also reviewed personality factors and undertook a mental state examination. He noted that she was moved to tears briefly when talking about the collision. He made no adverse comments about these matters.146. Dr Virgona reviewed the medical documentation provided to him by the solicitor for the defendants. He remarked that the materials from Dr Yap, Dr Zaka and Dr Gunasena made no mention of psychological symptoms. He acknowledged that the records of Dr Cotterell made reference to the plaintiff having felt “like a stunned mullet after the accident initially but after a while she seemed fine”. That quotation was obviously his summation of history because it appears to intermix an account of history with an element of conclusion.147. The report of Dr Virgona incorporated an inaccurate summation of the opinion expressed by Dr McCombe. In this regard, Dr Virgona summarised the opinion of Dr McCombe as being “he was of the view that there were inconsistent findings, that she was not coping well with her pain and that there were some features of ‘abnormal psychosomatic illness behaviour’”. In contrast to that summary, the relevant portion of the report of Dr McCombe that had been summarised by Dr Virgona, in fact stated : 
     
     “You also specifically ask for an opinion as to whether any functional, hysterical or psychosomatic condition is affecting your client. This is always difficult to say with any degree of certainty. She does appear to be rather anxious and frightened by the pain. The history of being in bed for three to four days at a time after doing vacuuming or mopping is suggestive of an inability to cope with her pain. There were certain inconsistent features on examination in terms of the location of the tenderness in that it was not particularly repeatable; however this is not an uncommon finding. I would express the view that she is not coping well with her pain and this latter inability to cope is in fact as  
     (sic for  
     a 
     ) 
      psychological problem that could by some be construed to be psychosomatic or function  
     (sic)  
     and hysterical. However, she would not fit the true definition of a functional hysterical person. There are some features of abnormal psychosomatic illness behaviour, though it is important to understand that she  
     (sic) 
      likely suffers from an underlying organic injury.” 
    148. In my view, when this portion of Dr McCombe’s actual report is read in context, it reveals Dr Virgona’s summary omitted important aspects of qualification of the views expressed by Dr McCombe which Dr Virgona appears to have overlooked. Dr McCombe’s reference to some features of abnormal illness behaviour was qualified by the emphasis on the likelihood that the plaintiff suffers from an underlying organic injury which places an entirely different perspective to the mention of abnormal illness behaviour.149. Dr Virgona reviewed the 2 September 2007 report of Dr Clark and stated that it appeared to him that Dr Clark had not detailed the symptoms, their nature, frequency or duration, that based his conclusions concerning dysthymia and chronic depression in the plaintiff’s presentation and his diagnosis of “Post Traumatic Stress Disorder with depression”.150. Dr Virgona concluded that it was likely the plaintiff had an anxiety type response to a frightening motor vehicle accident where the thought of the death of her daughter was noted at the time. He stated that she subsequently developed specific anxiety, and likely panic attacks, associated with driving, and with proximity to trucks in particular, and for a short period, nightmares related to the accident. He also noted some ongoing sleep disturbance requiring sedative hypnotics, not appearing to be anxiety related. He stated that she was now symptom-free and reported no psychological impairment affecting any of her functioning.151. The defendants sought to tender a commentary letter dated 10 September 2009 from Dr Virgona. The tender was objected to by the plaintiff and it was rejected because it had been served out of time required for service. The rejected letter was marked MFI “2”. That letter was not based on any updated examination and was restricted to comments.Ms O’Dwyer – consultant occupational therapist152. On 21 February 2008, at the request of the solicitor for the defendants, the plaintiff underwent an assessment by an occupational therapist, Ms Detta O’Dwyer. The report of that consultation was dated 21 April 2008. The assessment, which took place over the course of a three hour period, involved the plaintiff performing tasks that included sitting, standing, walking, and demonstrating functional postures and activities in her home environment.153. In the course of her interview with the plaintiff, Ms O’Dwyer took a baseline history that the plaintiff had been living independently before her injury and had been working until December 2004. After reviewing the medical evidence that had been provided to her, Ms O’Dwyer tabulated her own findings concerning the plaintiff’s movements and functional tolerances concerning her neck, left shoulder and lumbar spine, including activities involving transfers, walking, sitting, lifting, carrying, standing, kneeling and squatting. She recorded limitations in the plaintiff’s abilities concerning all these activities.154. Ms O’Dwyer reported that the plaintiff has remained independent with activities concerning showering, drying, dressing, grooming, toileting and personal hygiene, noting that the plaintiff sits down whilst dressing herself.155. Ms O’Dwyer assessed the plaintiff as having the physical capacity to prepare meals without assistance, if living alone. She noted some limitations with regard to laundry activity, namely, having to lower the clothesline when hanging clothes, and to doing a little ironing at a time rather than in a prolonged session. She noted that the plaintiff had difficulty with heavy domestic cleaning tasks and that these were attended to by her daughter. Ms O’Dwyer thought that the plaintiff’s functional capacity for domestic cleaning tasks could be increased with the provision of functional education by an occupational therapist, however she stated that there were some tasks which she was assessed as being unable to undertake, comprising cleaning bathrooms, heavy vacuuming and mopping. In this regard, Ms O’Dwyer recommended the provision of 2 hours per week of domestic assistance plus 12 hours per year of assistance with spring cleaning tasks.156. Ms O’Dwyer noted that the reported difficulty with shopping activities, including reaching forward and having access to shelves as well as manipulating items out of the trolley, pushing a trolley and lifting bags. In this regard Ms O’Dwyer thought it was reasonable, in view of the plaintiff’s multilevel disc protrusion, that 1 hour per week for shopping assistance be provided. That opinion also assumed, incorrectly, that the plaintiff’s disc protrusions were associated with nerve involvement, which they were not. Nevertheless, the basis upon which such assistance is said to be required, is in my view, sufficiently demonstrated by reference to the plaintiff’s disc protrusions alone, although there is some contention as to the time estimates Ms O’Dwyer had allowed for shopping activities.157. Ms O’Dwyer believed that the plaintiff should be justifiably provided with one hour per month of assistance with gardening and 30 minutes, presumably each week, for community access to facilities such as banking, shopping, paying bills and the like.158. Ms O’Dwyer itemised her recommendations to identify the need for the provision of 3.5 hours per week of domestic assistance which, when costed at the differential rates for the different activities, amounted to approximately $5435.60 per year or $104.53 per week.C. FINDINGS ON CONFLICTING EVIDENCEMedical issues arising from the reports tendered by the parties159. There are two principal areas of disagreement within the medical evidence. The first relates to the views of the specialists in physical medicine disciplines and the second relates to the views of the consultant psychiatrists.Differences of opinion amongst physical medicine specialists160. The earlier described reports of the extensive series of the radiological investigations that were undertaken concerning the plaintiff’s neck and back, comprising CT scans, MRI scans and SPECT scans, variously reveal the presence of degenerative changes, disc bulges, disc protrusions and disc herniations.161. Dr McCombe, who is an orthopaedic surgeon, was the first medical specialist to examine the plaintiff after her injury. In my view, he was in a position of particular advantage to observe the evolution of the plaintiff’s problems concerning her cervical, thoracic and lumbar spines and associated soft tissue structures in the period between November 2005 and August 2006. 162. In the context of the plaintiff’s evidence that she had recovered from the effects of her 1994 neck and back problems by about 1997, I do not consider the recorded history by Dr McCombe of denial by the plaintiff of previous spinal pain to be of significance in this case, because the plaintiff was free of neck and back pain and was functioning without difficulty over those years until her injury on 29 June 2005.163. Dr McCombe obtained a history of a substantial collision and the contemporaneous onset of neck and back pain with radiation of pain into the left shoulder and the left leg. The onset was from the time of the injury on 29 June 2005 continuing until the time of his consultation on 7 November 2005. On examining the plaintiff he found associated tenderness and muscle spasm. The contemporaneous CT scan showed a left-sided foraminal disc protrusion at L3/4. He recommended conservative treatment which is what then ensued.164. Subsequent reports by Dr Jackson, on behalf of the MAA, Associate Professor McPhee on behalf of the defendants, and Dr Conrad on behalf of the plaintiff all acknowledged the existence of radiological evidence showing extensive degenerative changes, disc bulges and disc protrusions in the plaintiff’s spine.165. Within this body of evidence competing views emerged as to the nature of the plaintiff's injury. 166. On the one hand, following his examination of the plaintiff on 16 February 2006, Dr Conrad, an experienced surgeon, was of the opinion that the plaintiff had a significant whiplash injury to the neck, a straining injury to her left shoulder and a back strain in association with a disc prolapse as shown in the CT scan. He considered this latter finding to be responsible for her complaints of left sided sciatica. In forming this view, he was aware of the previous injuries to the neck and back which the plaintiff had sustained in 1994. When he examined the plaintiff again on 28 May 2009 and updated the history, he undertook a review of a more extensive series of radiological scans and came to the opinion that the whiplash injury to the neck was associated with a C3/4 disc and he confirmed his earlier view as to the L3/4 disc protrusion. He also noticed the presence of paravertebral muscle spasm.167. On the other hand, Associate Professor McPhee, a spinal surgeon, and Dr Jackson, a musculoskeletal specialist, who respectively assessed the plaintiff on 14 February 2007 and 2 March 2007, acknowledged the fact of the plaintiff’s whiplash injury to her spine, but expressed the view that the injury consisted of aggravation of underlying degenerative changes to the spine rather than having caused frank disc injuries. In the case of the opinion of Associate Professor McPhee, he acknowledged that the plaintiff was in the category of a small group of patients who continue to suffer the long-term effects of such injuries.168. In the context of this case, where I place a high value clinical advantage of the treating orthopaedic surgeon who first saw the plaintiff in the more acute phase of her injury and evolving disabilities, I nevertheless consider that it does not much matter whether the plaintiff suffered frank injuries to the affected discs of her spine or whether she had aggravated underlying degenerative changes in her spine. The effect has been the same, namely, resulting in pain, discomfort and restriction of movement in the neck and back, with associated radiating pain into the left shoulder and the left leg, along with reduced sitting, standing, walking, bending and related tolerances, including fitness for work.169. In these circumstances, I do not see the conflict, such as it is, to be material so far as the cause and effect of he plaintiff’s neck and back problems are concerned because, the simple fact is, since the subject collision, the plaintiff has these problems and the collision was the material contributing cause to these problems.170. There is a conflict of opinion between Associate Professor McPhee and Dr Conrad as to other matters. Associate Professor McPhee was critical of Dr Conrad’s opinion as to whether or not the plaintiff had suffered a shoulder strain as well as being critical of Dr Conrad’s described or assumed examination technique. As to the shoulder problems, I do not consider it necessary to resolve the question of whether there was a strain or whether the pain experienced by the plaintiff was a referred or a radiated pain. The fact remains, the plaintiff has persisting discomfort in this area due to the injuries she sustained in the collision, which is the critical matter. If Associate Professor McPhee and Dr Conrad had been called to give oral evidence it may have been possible to explore and resolve these differences but this did not occur. In the result, I do not consider the area of disagreement between Associate Professor McPhee and Dr Conrad to be material.Differences of opinion amongst the consultant psychiatrists171. The defendants had submitted that as the plaintiff has not sought any treatment at all for psychological injuries, including medication, and no recommendation for treatment has been made by the more recent practitioner, the plaintiff could not have a serious psychological condition. The defendants submitted that if the plaintiff’s psychological injuries were as serious as alleged, it would be expected, as a minimum, that there would have been at the very least, referral to some form of specialty in the area of psychology. The defendants further submitted that as this has not occurred over a lengthy period of time, this suggests that Dr Clark’s diagnosis is unreliable for lack of symptomatology. In this regard the defendants submitted that the report of Dr Virgona should be preferred “in the light of the objective evidence of nil psychological treatment”.172. In contrast, the plaintiff points to the difference of opinion between Dr Clark and Dr Virgona and submitted, in effect, that the opinion of Dr Virgona should carry no weight because of his summary of the history. The plaintiff further submitted that the impression conveyed by Dr Virgona does not accord with the evidence.173. It therefore becomes necessary to examine the basis for disagreement within the reports of the two psychiatrists who examined the plaintiff. On the one hand, Dr Clark assessed the plaintiff as having post-traumatic stress disorder, dysthymic disorder and depression as a result of the collision. On the other hand, Dr Virgona was of the view that the plaintiff was free of psychological symptoms and reported no impairment following the events of the collision. 174. Dr Virgona offered criticisms of the opinions of Dr Clark regarding his conclusions and diagnosis. It seems to me that the basis of the disagreement was the differing approaches these two experts seemed to have taken in their evaluation of the plaintiff. Whereas Dr Clark had diagnosed these conditions, Dr Virgona was of the view that the plaintiff was symptom free and reported no psychological impairment.175. As neither of these two experts were called to give oral evidence to clarify and explain the basis upon which they had formed their opinions, the analysis of their competing views was limited to the confines of their respective reports, aided by the broader context of the evidence. 176. In the absence of explanatory evidence from these psychiatrists, the end point of the analysis that I have undertaken is that for the reasons that follow, I have found the reports and opinions of Dr Clark more persuasive and convincing than those of Dr Virgona.177. First, in my view it appears that following his single one hour consultation with the plaintiff, that Dr Virgona has omitted to place any significance upon the history of pain he obtained from the plaintiff when he reached the following diagnosis and opinion that was set out on page 6 of his report” 
     
     “… She is now symptom-free, reports no psychological impairment affecting any of her functioning and is able to look after herself, her chores, the grandchildren, travels and drives without difficulty and maintains social contacts. 
      
      
     In summary, it is likely that she had a short-lived Adjustment Disorder with Anxiety in response to the motor accident. This resolved without any treatment. At no point has she suffered the range and severity of symptoms consistent with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder and when those diagnoses have been noted by Dr Cottrell (sic) and Dr Clark, neither have detailed any symptoms that would allow the diagnosis to be made. In any event, her psychological symptoms have resolved.” 
    178. In this regard, I find it difficult to co-relate this summary by Dr Virgona of the plaintiff’s psychological complaints with the detail given by the plaintiff in her evidence in these proceedings. I am left with the impression that Dr Virgona has not delved into the history and the detail of the psychological matters that affected the plaintiff in the same way as Dr Clark, or if he has, he has summarised it in a superficial way which leads me to prefer Dr Clark’s report. This is a mater that could have been clarified by calling oral evidence.179. Secondly, I am reinforced in this view when I consider Dr Virgona’s very short account of the plaintiff’s history of being afraid of trucks on the road and having nightmares, a problem that still remained to a degree at the time he examined her. He seems to have relied upon a number of colloquial expressions offered by the plaintiff as evidence for his view that the plaintiff has been minimally affected by the events of the collision in a psychological sense, for example, his citation of the plaintiff having had panic attacks with palpitations and hyperventilation “a fair while ago” when she saw trucks on the road. Dr Virgona did not seem to explore at least recount a discussion as to what this expression meant in practical terms.180. Significantly, in his report Dr Virgona recorded that the plaintiff still experiences such attacks, as is evidenced by his statement that she is “now able to ‘catch them’ when she feels any anxiety coming,’ talk myself out of it” and then calm down. In my view, this reveals that the plaintiff still experiences panic attacks with palpitations and hyperventilation, which is plainly inconsistent with Dr Virgona’s conclusion that she is free of psychological symptoms. A possible explanation for Dr Virgona’s view could be that a consideration of such symptoms is a question of degree but without explanatory evidence to this being called, that possible explanation remains speculative and does not permit reasoned inference : Luxton v Vines [1952] HCA 19; (1952) 85 CLR 352. To draw the inference sought, a medical explanation is required and this is absent : Strinic v Singh [2009] NSWCA 15. This analysis leads me to the view that the plaintiff’s history has been incompletely explored and analysed for significance in the report of Dr Virgona, in contrast to the explanations offered in Dr Clark’s reports. 181. Thirdly, Dr Virgona took a history that the plaintiff had been taking the medication Endep, and was still taking the medications diazepam, Stilnox and Panadeine Forte. Other evidence, including the general practitioner records tendered by the defendants, discloses a pattern of the plaintiff obtaining frequent prescriptions for some of these medications. Whilst I caution myself against relying upon my own understanding of the possible psychotropic effects of some of these medications, I consider that the absence of any discussion on these matters by Dr Virgona to be a matter of unresolved significance to his opinions. 182. On the basis of publicly accessible decisions of courts, e.g. [2006] NSWSC 727 at [201] it is known in the community that the prescription drug diazepam is an addictive benzodiazepene that is sometimes prescribed for its psychotropic effects. In this case it appears to have been prescribed to the plaintiff in 2 mg doses for treatment of her paravertebral muscle spasm, which has been remarked upon by Dr Conrad and other doctors. There is no evidence as to whether the 2 mg dose of that drug prescribed for the plaintiff could also have a psychotherapeutic effect or action in her circumstances. This is an issue that could have been quickly resolved through oral evidence, however, in the circumstances, I make no finding on the issue: Strinic v Singh [2009] NSWCA 15.183. Fourthly, I consider that in reviewing the history obtained from the report of Dr Cotterell, Dr Virgona appears to have overlooked an important item of history that was obviously relevant to a consideration of the plaintiff’s psychiatric status. This is apparent from the context of his citation from Dr Cotterell’s records: “...she was noted to have said she was ‘like a stunned mullet after the accident initially but after a while she seemed fine’...”.184. In fact the context of that quotation was : “She says that when she starts walking she is fine but after about 10 minutes she is stooped over – it is as if her back is made of jelly(.) She says that the pain is interfering with her hearing and her thinking (.) She says she was like a stunned mullet after the accident initially but after a while she seemed fine (.) She says that she is getting mixed up (examples were given) she does not know if this is an effect from the accident or whether it is related to her chronic pain (.) She is getting nauseated (.)”: Exhibit “1” pages 57-58. [Emphasis added]185. The plaintiff’s history of reported interference with thinking and getting mixed-up were matters that were passed over in favour of a focus upon the “stunned mullet” comment. Dr Virgona may have had a perfectly good psychiatric explanation for doing so, but if that is the case, that explanation was not adduced into evidence. In the absence of a scientific or psychiatric discussion in the expert evidence on the significance of this history, a logical commonsense analysis is open : Adelaide Stevedoring Co Ltd v Forst [1940] HCA 45; (1940) 64 CLR 53. In my view that analysis suggests that the omitted history that I have cited above has some materiality to the assessment of the plaintiff’s post-injury psychological problems. However, having identified the issue, in the absence of expert evidence, the matter must be left unresolved.186. Fifthly, unlike Dr Clark, Dr Virgona did not analyse or comment upon any relationship between the plaintiff’s experience of pain and the plaintiff’s experience of distress or depression.187. Dr Virgona took a history of the plaintiff experiencing pain in the left side of her neck, into her shoulder blade and in the middle of her back radiating into her left hip and down the back of her legs. He recorded that this pain was associated with feelings of pins and needles and occasional numbness in her hands and feet. She told Dr Virgona this pain was initiated by activity and the pain affected her sleep. She self-rated the pain in the range 5-7 out of a scale of 10, where 0 was no pain and 10 was unbearable.188. Appropriately for the context, Dr Virgona cited the 2 September report of Dr Clark which referred to the plaintiff having developed pain and considerable psychiatric distress, noting Dr Clark’s view that the plaintiff’s distress had become chronic and had evolved into chronic depression, known as dysthymia. However, the diagnosis and opinion portion of Dr Virgona’s report provided no discussion on the relationship or absence of a relationship, between the plaintiff’s complaints of pain and the development of distress and chronic depression. His statement that the plaintiff is “now symptom free” could not reasonably be taken to be a reference to the absence of physical pain because, noting that she was a clear and concise historian, Dr Virgona obtained a 5-7 out of 10 pain rating from the plaintiff. 189. The inference I draw from these circumstances is that despite his criticisms of the report of Dr Clark, Dr Virgona did not traverse or contradict Dr Clark’s view of an association between the plaintiff’s perception of pain and her depression.190. Sixthly, Dr Virgona appears to have at least in part based his diagnostic conclusion as to the absence in the plaintiff of psychological impairment on the fact that she has not sought or been referred for professional help. In making that comment Dr Virgona provided no discussion on the reasonableness or otherwise of the plaintiff’s reticent attitude to such treatment. He recorded something of that attitude in his report after he had elicited from the plaintiff that she had learnt to cope on her own. Dr Virgona did not have the benefit of the evidence the plaintiff gave of her reluctance to take antidepressants because they made her feel groggy. 191. Importantly on this issue, Dr Virgona was not privy to the unchallenged evidence of the plaintiff that was elicited in cross-examination, to the effect that she intended to pursue the recommendation of Dr Saunders, a specialist to whom she had been recently referred by her general practitioner. The recommendation of that doctor was that she take antidepressant medication. 192. It was apparent to Dr Clark at the time he saw the plaintiff on 20 May 2009, that the plaintiff had been seen by a psychologist and she had been taking antidepressant drugs : Report of Dr Clark 2 June 2009, page 8.5. This evidence was not challenged or explored as to when this treatment had commenced. Dr Virgona did not have the benefit of this important item of history.193. Dr Virgona was not called to give oral evidence to comment upon this development in the history of the plaintiff’s treatment. This evidence gives rise to an inference worthy of consideration that the plaintiff had symptoms of sufficient significance for her to recant her earlier reluctance to take antidepressant medication. In view of this evidence, the stated basis for this aspect of Dr Virgona’s opinion is of only limited probative value and I therefore attach no weight to it. 194. Seventhly, in view of the matters analysed, I find it difficult to accept Dr Virgona’s opinion that the plaintiff has made a full recovery from the psychological disorders she had, without treatment, and without future treatment being necessary. I find Dr Virgona’s conclusion that the plaintiff “has made a full recovery from the psychological disorder without treatment” to be inherently unpersuasive, having regard to the history elicited by Dr Clark over time, on two separate occasions 21 months apart, and having regard to the evidence of the plaintiff, which I accept.195. Accordingly, I reject the opinions of Dr Virgona.196. In contrast, I find the opinions of Dr Clark concerning his assessment of the plaintif to be persuasive in this case.197. Dr Clark not only identified the physical trauma of the incident but he also explored psychological consequences, appropriately characterising them as representing something akin to a near-death experience. Dr Clark’s opinion was that the shock suffered by the plaintiff caused her to develop insomnia and hypervigilance. This seems a reasonable and inherently plausible sequence of events. So too does his opinion concerning the plaintiff’s development of pain in the neck, shoulder and back and associated sciatica with considerable psychiatric distress, indicative of a traumatised state.198. I do not consider the criticism made by Dr Virgona concerning the limited particularity of Dr Clark’s findings in this regard as being valid. Distress is a well recognized concept, as is chronic distress. I see no reason why, on the expert evidence, or even as a matter of plain analysis, Dr Clark’s opinion concerning the evolution of the plaintiff’s distress leading to a chronic depression, should not be accepted. The conclusion does not seem glaringly improbable. It was not explored through cross-examination seeking to expose it is a flawed conclusion. In the circumstances I am persuaded that the opinions of Dr Clark in this regard should be accepted.199. With respect to Dr Clark’s diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder, it is noteworthy that he provided highlighted reasons from within the detailed descriptors for diagnosing psychiatric impairment according to AMA 4th Edition Guidelines for the Assessment of Whole Person Impairment. Those highlighted areas appear between pages 4 and 7 of his report dated 2 June 2009, including a tabulated summary of those highlighted items of history. These matters were not relevantly contradicted and accordingly, I accept Dr Clark’s diagnostic descriptions.200. When Dr Clark saw the plaintiff for reassessment on 20 May 2009, just 24 days after Dr Virgona saw the plaintiff on 13 April 2009, he recorded that on his examination of the plaintiff’s emotional state, she exhibited the signs and symptoms of an anxiety state. He also recorded she had avoidance behaviour in that she does not watch disturbing television programmes.201. Dr Clark has expressed the opinion that the plaintiff suffers from a recognized psychiatric disorder, namely post-traumatic stress disorder due to a primary psychological/psychiatric injury. He also diagnosed continuing chronic depression and withdrawal, describing it as a dysthymic disorder. He described the origin of these problems as being the “horrendous accident” which is the subject of these proceedings. 202. Having reviewed the psychiatric evidence against the background of the plaintiff’s evidence, I find no relevant inconsistencies in her evidence, and I am persuaded to accept Dr Clark’s diagnostic and prognostic conclusions to the effect that the plaintiff has incurred and will continue to have, a chronic psychiatric illness characterised by the descriptions post-traumatic stress disorder and depression. In this regard, I prefer the views of Dr Clark to the views of Dr Virgona, for the reasons I have stated.DVD evidence tendered by the defendant203. The defendants tendered and screened a DVD comprising 12 video surveillance sequences of the plaintiff’s activities at a time when the plaintiff did not know she was being observed : Exhibit “3”. Those sequences totalled 19 minutes of viewing time. In summary, the sequences showed the plaintiff getting in and out of the driver's side of the vehicle, the vehicle being driven, the plaintiff alighting from the vehicle, undertaking some shopping at a supermarket in company with her daughter, leaving the supermarket, sitting on a bench, then entering the driver's side of the vehicle, driving the vehicle, first in reverse out of the supermarket car park, then driving home, taking some shopping out of the boot of the vehicle and walking up a steep pathway to the house whilst carrying some items and her handbag under her left arm.204. He plaintiff’s daughter gave unchallenged evidence, which I accept, that the items the plaintiff was seen to have been carrying from the boot of the vehicle on this occasion, comprised light boxes of breakfast cereal.205. The DVD sequences showing the plaintiff’s activities in the supermarket were relevant, but in my view, they were uncontradictory of the plaintiff’s evidence. In sequence, they show very short segments of the plaintiff’s activities in pushing a supermarket trolley, at times by herself, selecting items of foodstuff with her left hand and placing these items in a trolley, and then pushing and manoeuvring the trolley. They also show the plaintiff bending over to reach into a freezer with her left arm.206. It is significant that none of these activities shown in these sequences were activities the plaintiff said she was unable to carry out. It is also significant that none of these activities, when performed occasionally, are said or claimed to be beyond the plaintiff’s physical abilities or advised levels of activity.207. In context, and without further descriptive evidence to explain the surrounding events, and without medical evidence commenting upon what is shown on the DVD sequences, I do not consider those sequences to form an adequately reasonable basis upon which to find, as the defendants submit, that the plaintiff was exaggerating or being in any way untruthful in her evidence in which she recounted her post-injury disabilities and impairments.208. In the absence of evidence of the surrounding circumstances, I consider that the approach to the interpretation of this DVD evidence is very much within the same category as is the case with photographic evidence, namely requiring caution in its interpretation : Angel v Hawkesbury Council [2008] NSWCA 130. I consider this to be so because the relative nature of the short sequences of activity shown on the DVD is not necessarily representative of the plaintiff’s activities. This is so because the DVD sequences show but a few moments in time and the content is not contradictory of the evidence given by the plaintiff.209. I accept, as is shown in the DVD, that the inference is open that the plaintiff was able to drive an unspecified distance within a matter of what appears to be about 16 minutes, and was able to walk about in a supermarket for about 20 minutes, picking up what I infer from what is shown, light items, and was able to drive home in what appears to be about 15 minutes, and walk up a path holding some boxes of breakfast cereal.210. In drawing these inferences from the DVD evidence, I do not consider that any of the activities as shown on the DVD contradict or in any way discredit the evidence given by the plaintiff.211. I will return to the subject of the content of the DVD sequences when making my findings concerning the plaintiff’s claim for the cost of provision of domestic assistance.Plaintiff’s probable life span212. It is necessary to identify the plaintiff’s probable remaining life span for the purpose of assessing some aspects of her entitlement to future damages. At trial the plaintiff was aged 57 years. On the prospective life tables, a 57 year-old female has an average survival estimated at 31.29 years. The medical evidence does not disclose any reason why the plaintiff’s probable future life span should be assessed to be anything less than this figure. Accordingly, I propose to use a probable survival assumption of 31 years. The 5 per cent multiplier for projection of future losses over 31 years is 833.8. As the life tables already incorporate a discount for mortality, it is unnecessary to apply a vicissitudes discount to this figure on account of considerations of possible early mortality.D. DAMAGES ASSESSMENT213. In the paragraphs that follow I set out my assessment of the heads of damage claimed by the plaintiff.Non-economic loss214. The parties were agreed that in this case the plaintiff has met the threshold requirements for an award of damages for non-economic loss : s 131 of the MAC Act.215. The plaintiff submitted that an appropriate range for the assessment of common law damages for non-economic loss in her case was in the range $180,000 to $200,000. On behalf of the defendants it was submitted that the appropriate sum to be awarded for non-economic loss was in the amount of $85,000. Those submissions must be evaluated in the light of my earlier findings concerning the nature and extent of the plaintiff’s disabilities, and the impact of those disabilities on the plaintiff’s enjoyment and amenity of her life.216. It is necessary to consider a relevant background event. In 1994 the plaintiff suffered neck and back injuries that had resulted from a fall. She took several years to recover from the effects of these injuries. In addition, around the time of that injury she had a nervous breakdown due to the effects of these injuries compounded by her marital and social circumstances and another intervening illness. Similarly, it took some years for her to recover from the effects of these difficulties and the ensuing emotional illness. Nevertheless, the plaintiff did recover from these problems, and re-entered the workforce to lead an active and satisfying life. 217. It is against this background that the plaintiff’s entitlement to damages for non-economic loss falls to be assessed. The defendants are required to take the plaintiff as she is found. This has particular relevance to the underlying asymptomatic degenerative condition of the plaintiff’s spine which was injured in the collision. The investigations that followed have revealed disc bulging, disc protrusions and abnormalities in different parts of the plaintiff’s spine that have given rise to symptoms since the injury in question.218. Physically, the plaintiff has suffered soft tissue whiplash injuries to her neck and her back. The effect of these injuries has been to aggravate underlying degenerative changes to render her neck and her back symptomatic. This has affected a number of levels in her cervical and lumbar spines where she has been shown to have disc bulges and disc protrusions. She experiences pain, discomfort and restriction of movement, she has reduced sitting, standing and walking tolerance. She has difficulty lifting carrying and bending and she is restricted in her physical capacities, including for domestic and employment activities. 219. The plaintiff’s physical problems fall into the category of long-term impairment following soft tissue injuries, as was explained by Associate Professor McPhee, whom I accept in this regard. Accordingly, the prognosis for the plaintiff is for ongoing physical symptoms in her neck, her back and in her left shoulder in the foreseeable future, as has been explained by Dr McCombe. The plaintiff will need treatment and medication for these conditions. The impact of these injuries, and the circumstances of the collision itself has had an effect on her sleeping patterns in that at times she suffers nightmares and psychological difficulties.220. The psychological effects of the injuries on the plaintiff have been significant. The collision itself was horrific and she thought that her daughter and her grandchild were significantly injured and placed in peril. She thought her daughter was going to be decapitated. This has been described by Dr Clark as a near-death experience. This has led to recurring nightmares and anxiety. The debilitating effects of her physical injuries have caused her to become depressed. She has been diagnosed as having post-traumatic stress disorder, a dysthymic disorder with chronic depression. Dr Clark, whom I have accepted, stated that she is in need of treatment for these problems. There is no indication in the medical evidence, that I have accepted, that would reasonably suggest these problems will abate.221. The effect of the collision has been to detrimentally affect the plaintiff’s ability to independently carry out all of her pre-injury day-to-day domestic tasks. The impairment of her earning capacity will be evaluated separately. The plaintiff has a statistical life span of a remaining 31 years.222. In my view, these circumstances call for a significant award of damages for non-economic loss. As is evident from the disparate range submitted by the parties, it must be recognized that minds may differ as to what constitutes a sound discretionary figure to compensate the plaintiff for this component of her loss. Taking the above factors and the medical evidence I have accepted into account, I consider that an appropriate sum to award for non-economic loss is the amount of $140,000. I therefore assess the plaintiff’s entitlement to damages for non-economic loss in the amount of $140,000.Past loss of earning capacity 223. The plaintiff claims damages for past loss of earning capacity on the basis that whilst she was not in actual employment at the time of her injury, she would most probably have returned to the workforce within a month or two of the time when she was injured. The plaintiff’s claim was for loss of earning capacity of $500 per week net over 215 weeks, namely $129,000. 224. There is a measure of support for the approach submitted on behalf of the plaintiff because, as I accept, the plaintiff was, at the time of her injury, seeking to re-enter the workforce as her daughters were recovering from their physical injuries. Those injuries, and her need to care for her daughters and their children, were circumstances that had earlier prevented the plaintiff from seeking work at an earlier time.225. In contrast, the defendants submitted that the appropriate starting point for the assessment of the claim for loss of earning capacity was the plaintiff’s pre-injury level of earnings. The defendants submitted a base rate of $380 per week net as the appropriate measure of the loss. An allowance of that sum over 208 weeks, as was contended by the defendants, amounted to an assessed loss of $79,040. However, the defendants further submitted that the claim for past loss of earning capacity should be reduced to reflect an argued fitness for light duties from between 1-2 years following her injury. 226. On this basis, the defendants contended that, using a rounded-up base figure of $400 per week net for the first 2 years following the injury, an initial amount of $41,600 should be allowed, followed by a reduced allowance for the remaining years to the date of the trial, namely a further $20,800, making a total allowance of $62,400.227. I consider that the defendants’ argument concerning a reduction in the amount for past loss of earning capacity on account of a claimed fitness for light duties 1-2 years after the injury to be unreasonable as it does not reflect the work qualifications in the medical evidence and I reject it for the reasons that follow.228. First, I do so because the medical opinions upon which that submission is necessarily based were heavily qualified with medically recommended restrictions on the tasks the plaintiff should be undertaking in a work setting. The defendants’ submission did not allow for that factor.229. Secondly, the plaintiff has been co-operating with the CRS in attempts by that organisation to place her in employment and I find it significant that apart from an attempted placement as a “lollypop lady” and some voluntary Red Cross work, which was not successful because the plaintiff could not carry out the allotted duties, the plaintiff has not been placed in any light employment to date.230. Thirdly, I consider that the significant work restrictions identified by Dr Conrad, Dr McCombe, Dr Jackson and Associate Professor McPhee support the conclusion that from a practical perspective, it is unlikely that the plaintiff would have been placed in employment.231. In these circumstances I consider that the defendants’ submission to the effect that the plaintiff had a partial residual earning capacity that arose at about 1-2 years after her injury should be rejected as that submission is dependent upon a theoretical capacity of no practical application, as is evidenced by the inability of the CRS or the plaintiff to find such suitable employment until now. I also base my rejection on the opinion of Associate Professor McPhee who significantly discounted the practicalities of the plaintiff’s prospects for placement in suitable employment.232. In my view, the plaintiff has taken reasonable steps to attempt to mitigate her claim for loss of earnings: s 136 of the MAC Act. She has attended the CRS and has undergone vocational capacity and functional assessments. She had earlier attended physiotherapy treatment until the CTP insurer declined to pay for the treatment. She continued to take medication and she has sought medical consultations. She has stated that she intends to follow up on a recent medical recommendation for psychological treatment. The CRS has not been successful in placing her in the restricted categories of employment within the medically identified restrictions on the parameters for her potential employment. 233. Quite apart from the question of fitness for light duty employment, as was suggested by the defendants, and which I have rejected, the plaintiff has submitted that the amount suggested by the defendants to compensate the plaintiff for past loss of earning capacity was too low.234. In order to test the defendants’ submissions as to the appropriate measure of the claimed loss, it is relevant to analyse the figures contained in the plaintiff’s income tax returns that were tendered by the defendant: Exhibit “2”. The relevant notices of assessment for the relevant tax years covered by the exhibit were not tendered. I have set out the following tabulation to summarise the plaintiff’s gross income and the tax withheld from that income between 1999 and 2005 as appears in Exhibit “2” to give an indication of the plaintiff’s pre-injury pattern of earnings.

    235. It is apparent from this tabulation that the weekly amount of $400 per week suggested by the defendants as the base rate to measure the plaintiff’s loss is too low and is unreflective of the plaintiff’s pre-injury earning capacity.236. The inadequacy of the defendants’ suggested analysis is revealed to be incorrect when it is recognised that the plaintiff’s earnings for the year ended June 30th 2005 were derived before Christmas 2004, which was when she finished work in order to travel to Queensland.237. Once this is recognised, the tabulated net earnings of $19,242 between 1 July 2004 and 31 December 2004, in respect of some 26 weeks, equates with a weekly rate of about $740 per week net, which seems to me to be commensurate with what would be expected as earnings for semi-skilled night shift factory work.238. Having identified the net rate of $740 per week in this way, in my view this renders the submitted rate of $500 per week net as claimed by the plaintiff to be more than reasonable. In my view the lesser rate of $500 per week net claimed by the plaintiff fairly recognises that the plaintiff voluntarily left her employment that paid the higher rate before she was injured which means that she may not have been able to readily secure such well paid employment again, either at all, or quickly. For this reason, I consider that the rate of $500 per week net as submitted by the plaintiff is a fair and reasonable rate for assessing her damages for past loss of earning capacity.239. The injury occurred on 29 June 2005. The evidence does not precisely disclose the intended duration of the plaintiff’s trip to Sydney to visit her mother, which was at the time when the injury occurred. In these circumstances it is necessary to arrive at a reasonable estimate. With this in mind I consider that the plaintiff would probably have returned to Queensland within 2 months of the date of her injury and at that time she would most probably have actively sought work, as by then her daughters would have fully recovered from their injuries, and her evidence was that she needed to work. 240. Given the plaintiff’s impressive work record, her work ethic, and also the breadth of her work experience in a variety of jobs, also taking into account the imponderables of the employment market, I consider it reasonable to infer that she would most probably have found employment again within a further 2 months, namely by the end of November 2005, had she remained uninjured. 241. The period from 1 December 2005 to the commencement of the trial is the equivalent of 197 weeks. After deducting an amount to represent the first 5 days of loss, as is required by s 124 of the MAC Act, this reveals an assessment of $500 per week net over 196 weeks in the amount of $98,500. I therefore assess the plaintiff’s damages for past loss of earning capacity in the sum of $98,500.Future loss of earning capacity242. The plaintiff makes a claim for future loss of earning capacity formulated as being for $650 per week net over 10 years of remaining working life until age 67 years. The projection of $650 per week net at 5 per cent over 10 years (x 412.9) less 15 per cent for vicissitudes, yields the claimed amount of $228,130.243. The defendants submitted that the appropriate period for assessment of damages for future loss of earning capacity was until age 65 years, namely a further 8 years. The defendants submitted that the medical evidence demonstrates the plaintiff has a residual earning capacity for light sedentary type work. On that basis, the defendants submitted that the appropriate allowance was for partial loss of earning capacity in the amount of $200 per week at 5 per cent over 8 years (x 345.6) less 15 per cent for vicissitudes, which yields an amount of $58,752.244. As the first step in the assessment process, it becomes necessary to determine the likely period over which, uninjured, the plaintiff would have been likely to have continued to exercise her earning capacity until retirement from the workforce. The defendants have submitted that period to be 8 years to age 65 years. That position was consistent with the age of 65 years which was mentioned by the plaintiff in her evidence. On behalf of the plaintiff it was contended that the relevant period should be 10 years to age 67 years, in accordance with current economic trends in an ageing population and in response to public encouragement from the government for workers to postpone their retirement and their ultimate reliance on the aged pension. Having regard to the plaintiff’s evidence, which I accept, that she needed to work in order to accrue savings for her retirement, I infer and find that, uninjured, the plaintiff would have continued to work until age 67 years, rather than to age 65 years.245. In order to assess the plaintiff’s claim for future loss of earning capacity it is necessary to identify a base rate of earnings for projection. The submissions of the parties, namely the full time rate of $650 per week net put forward on the part of the plaintiff, and the part time restricted duties rate of $200 per week net put forward on the part of the defendants, were not based on actual comparable rates. Instead, these figures were adjusted figures that were contended as being appropriate rates for assessment. 246. It therefore becomes necessary to reconcile the differences in these two approaches.247. The starting point for this reconciliation is to seek an understanding of the basis of the defendants’ position. It seems that the contended loss of $200 per week net is based on the notion of a capacity for part-time work of about 15 hours per week, which is the rough equivalent of working 2 days per week. When analysed in this way $200 per week is the equivalent of a full time earnings rate of a little over $8 per hour net if it is to represent 25 hours of lost earnings, being the notional weekly balance lost after allowing for 15 hours of part time work. This analysis reveals the defendants’ assumption to be a rate of $320 per week for a full time 40 hour week. ($200 ÷ 25 hours = $8 per hour)248. When analysed in this way, the defendants’ position is revealed to be arbitrary and unrelated to the reality of the plaintiff’s lost capacity for uninjured earnings at a much higher rate, possibly approaching $740 per week net. It is on account of this analysis that I reject as demonstrably unreasonable, the rate proposed by the defendants as it seems to me to be manifestly unreasonable as a basis to compensate the plaintiff for future loss of earning capacity.249. This then leads to the need to determine whether the plaintiff’s loss should be assessed as being a full loss, as was claimed on her behalf, or a partial loss as was submitted on behalf of the defendants.250. In my view, properly understood, the views of Dr McCombe, Dr Jackson and Dr Conrad, which indicate the plaintiff may have a degree of residual earning capacity, indicate that any potential residual earning capacity in the plaintiff is theoretical only, and unlikely to be productive of significant residual earnings. I consider this to be so because, in my view, the restrictions they propose on the contemplated work activities indicate it is unlikely the plaintiff would ever be able to significantly exercise such a residual earning capacity. In this regard, I prefer the opinion of the defendants’ expert Associate Professor McPhee, who has predicted, reasonably in my view, that the probability of the plaintiff obtaining suitable employment would be low, or virtually zero.251. Having reached the conclusion that the plaintiff has no real prospect of deriving any significant income from any residual earning capacity, which I consider to be minimal on the medical evidence I have cited, it remains to assess the plaintiff’s future loss of earning capacity in monetary terms, including the appropriate rate to be projected for calculation of the future loss.252. Subject to three qualifications that I shall identify, I have concluded that the plaintiff’s submission of a rate of $650 per week is a reasonable basis for projection, especially when compared with her pre-injury earnings rate which has been shown to have been of the order of up to $740 per week net.253. The first qualification is that, having left her employment as a night shift packer, it has to be recognised that the plaintiff might not have obtained such work again. This is a factor for which a non-vicissitudes discount should be applied, I consider that a reduction from $740 per week to $650 per week is a sufficient recognition of that factor.254. The second qualification is that in light of the medical evidence indicating that it was probable that the plaintiff had underlying degenerative changes in her spine, in my view, in this case it has to be recognised that a greater than usual discount for possible adverse vicissitudes needs to be applied to reflect the possibility that either through work or advancing age, such degenerative changes may have affected the plaintiff’s ability to continue to work, even absent injury. In this regard, instead of applying a conventional discount of 15 per cent for possible adverse vicissitudes, I propose to apply a discount of 20 per cent on account of this factor.255. The third qualification is that I consider that some small allowance should be made to reflect the possibility that, intermittently, and to a minor degree, the plaintiff may find some small degree of residual earning capacity. I propose to allow an offset of $50 per week as an average figure to reflect this possibility.256. Following this course, I consider the appropriate formulation of the claim for future loss of earning capacity to be $650 per week net, less $50 per week net for the possibility of residual earnings, i.e. $600 per week net, projected at 5 per cent over 10 years (x 419.2) less 20 per cent for vicissitudes, yielding the amount of $213,792.257. I therefore assess the plaintiff’s damages for future loss of earning capacity in the sum of $213,792.Past superannuation losses 258. The convention is for the loss of past employer funded superannuation to be assessed at 11 per cent of the amount assessed to represent past loss of earning capacity. Accordingly, applying that approach, 11 per cent of $98,500 is $10,835. I therefore assess the plaintiff’s damages for past superannuation loss in the amount of $10,835.Future superannuation losses 259. Consistent with the approach taken with respect to the assessment of past loss of employer funded superannuation, applying the same convention to the calculation of future superannuation losses, 11 per cent of $213,792 yields an amount of $23,517. I therefore assess the plaintiff’s damages for future superannuation loss in the amount of $23,517. This sum has already been discounted for vicissitudes.Past domestic assistance260. The plaintiff makes a claim for damages for past domestic assistance. The claim was initially formulated as being for 8 hours per week at $22 per hour over 220 weeks totalling $38,720. The plaintiff later reformulated the claim in the amount of $81,460 in respect of three relevant periods.261. The first submitted period was in respect of the initial 6 months, between 29 June 2005 and 29 January 2006. The claim in respect of that period was for 30 hours per week over 26 weeks at $22 per hour, namely $17,160. The calculation contains an error as the period is in fact 30 weeks so the sum should be $19,800.262. The second submitted period was for the ensuing 18 months between 1 February 2006 and 1 August 2007. The claim in respect of that period was for 19.5 hours per week over 72 weeks at $22 per hour, namely $30,900. The period is actually 78 weeks and the actual calculation is $33,462.263. The third submitted period was between 1 August 2007 and the trial on 16 September 2009. The claim in respect of that period was for 16.5 hours per week over 92 weeks at $22 per hour, namely $33,460. The period was actually 110 weeks and the calculation should therefore be $39,930.264. The submitted amounts totalled $81,460. The adjusted submissions totalled $94,192.265. The first matter to observe about this component of the plaintiff’s claim is that any damages for past care must be precisely calculated so as not exceed the rate prescribed by s 128(4)(a) and s 128(5) of the MAC Act.266. The defendants have submitted that the plaintiff has not made good her claim for the submitted amount of $81,460 for past domestic assistance provided to her by family members. In this regard, the defendants pointed to the state of the evidence and to the absence of any evidence from the plaintiff’s daughter concerning the detail of the care she claimed to have provided to assist her mother with tasks such as washing clothes, doing the shopping, personal care and the like. 267. Instead, the plaintiff’s daughter gave evidence that she provided some 15-16 hours per week of care to the plaintiff over a period of 18 months. The problem with that evidence was that this care was undifferentiated as to its description and clearly related to the needs of other members of the family rather than just to the plaintiff. This is not a case where, for example, the running of the plaintiff’s household required certain assistance which required replacement of labour even though part of it was for the benefit of others : Morgan v Gibson [1997] NSWCA 212. In this instance, the plaintiff joined her daughter’s household, and it was her daughter who provided assistance to the plaintiff, presumably including from the period when the plaintiff was in Sydney before she returned to Queensland and thereafter.268. The defendants have also submitted that the plaintiff’s evidence on this topic has been left in an unsatisfactory state. The defendants submitted that the calculation posited by the plaintiff was based on error, and as such, should not be accepted. The defendants further developed this submission by pointing out that the plaintiff gave no evidence as to any breakdown of time which was required by her for gratuitous assistance following the collision, and in the period leading up to the time of the trial.269. In my view, an examination of evidence indicates that the defendants’ submissions concerning the unsatisfactory state of the evidence is undoubtedly correct. The evidence does not provide any rational basis for assessing the past care claim. This is an issue on which the plaintiff bears the onus of proof. In this case, I accept the defendants’ submission that such proof is absent.270. Notwithstanding the defendants’ submission as cited above, an evaluation of the claim must be attempted in order to try and quantify it, if it is possible to do so.271. In submissions, the defendants initially conceded the plaintiff’s need for past care at 3.5 hours per week but pointed out that these hours did not exceed the statutory threshold required for an award of damages for past gratuitous care: s 128(3) of the MAC Act. The plaintiff could not point to any evidence to the contrary of that position. If that position had prevailed, I consider that on the evidence, the plaintiff would not have been able to obtain an award of damages for past domestic assistance for a considerable period following her injury.272. Notwithstanding the position identified by the defendants, as summarised in the preceding paragraph, and notwithstanding the state of the evidence, the defendants decided to abandon that position and conceded an allowance of 8 hours per week for past gratuitous care, but limited to a period of 8 months from the time of injury until February 2006, which was the time when the defendants argued that Dr Conrad had certified the plaintiff to be fit for light duties. 273. In this regard, the defendants conceded that the appropriate sum to be awarded for those 8 months was $5760, being 8 hours per week for 32 weeks at the rate of $22.50 per hour. The plaintiff has not adduced evidence to the contrary of this position, and in view of that concession by the defendants and in view of the state of the evidence, I propose to allow a sum along these lines, but adjusted to ensure that the maximum rate provided by s 128 of the MAC Act is not exceeded. The adjusted amount for this period is $5757, as calculated in Table I annexed to my reasons.274. The defendants submitted that thereafter, namely after 17 February 2006, they rely upon the report of Ms O’Dwyer and submit an appropriate amount for the remaining and 176 weeks from 17 February 2006 to the date of the trial is $13,860, being 3.5 hours per week over 176 weeks costed at $22.50 per hour. The period is actually 186 weeks which adjusts the submitted calculation to be $14,647.275. The defendants further submitted that in the absence of any professional’s qualified assessment of the plaintiff’s care needs, the defendants’ expert, Ms O’Dwyer should be accepted as to the manner in which the claim for past care should be quantified. I should observe that a professionally qualified assessment is not necessarily the required test upon which to base an award of damages of this kind.276. I consider the defendants’ submission concerning the period of care from 17 February 2006 to the trial to be flawed and based on an incorrect foundation. It is necessary to review the medical and allied evidence to demonstrate that flaw concerning the position of the defendants on the plaintiff’s claim for past care.277. I consider that the appropriate starting point for an evaluation of the plaintiff’s claim for past domestic assistance is to undertake a survey of the array of the expert views on the subject, in the chronological order in which those views arise.278. On 17 February 2006, Dr Conrad expressed the opinion that in the event the plaintiff’s daughter would be unable to assist with the heavier part of housework and shopping, the plaintiff would need about 6 hours per week of home care assistance. This was the first time an expert witness had turned their mind to the issue of the plaintiff’s need for domestic assistance.279. On 24 August 2006, Dr McCombe took a history that the plaintiff could not manage to lift a bag of groceries and she experienced a great deal of difficulty mopping or vacuuming. He expressed no opinion on whether the plaintiff actually needed domestic assistance but this evidence does provide a basis for drawing inferences in that regard.280. On 19 February 2007, Associate Professor McPhee took a history from the plaintiff of difficulty she experienced with carrying out household chores such as vacuuming, mopping, carrying the groceries. However, he noted that she had an ability to wash up, to cook, to do some washing and to do some hand washing. He noted that it was reasonable to assume the plaintiff would have some incapacity for the most robust and heavy tasks involved in domestic activities. He did not venture an opinion concerning a recommendation or a prescription for domestic assistance for the plaintiff.281. On 5 March 2007, Dr Jackson noted in the plaintiff a range of impaired activities involving daily living tasks concerning bathing, grooming, dressing, eating, writing and grasping, amongst other things. He made no particular recommendations concerning the provision of domestic care on account of this assessment.282. On 21 April 2008, Ms O’Dwyer considered that the plaintiff required the provision of an average of 3.5 hours per week of domestic assistance for domestic cleaning, shopping, spring cleaning and gardening.283. On 29 March 2009, Associate Professor McPhee noted that the plaintiff had some difficulties with activities such as difficulty putting on her bra and carrying light objects such as a 2 litre container of milk but that she was able to do many of the light chores of housework except that vacuuming or lifting groceries was difficult. Again, he made no recommendations concerning the provision of domestic assistance to the plaintiff.284. On 13 April 2009 Dr Virgona considered that, based on psychological considerations, the plaintiff had no need for domestic assistance.285. On 29 May 2009, Dr Conrad reiterated his earlier opinion concerning his recommendation of the provision of 6 hours per week of home care assistance for the plaintiff.286. The foregoing review of the expert evidence tendered in the proceedings reveals a contest between the opinion of Dr Conrad, a surgeon, who recommended the provision of 6 hours per week for domestic assistance to the plaintiff and the opinion of Ms O’Dwyer, an occupational therapist, who recommended the provision of 3.5 hours per week for such assistance.287. I have concluded that in the context of this array of opinion evidence, I prefer the opinion of Dr Conrad on the issue of the plaintiff’s past care needs. I have reached this conclusion for a number of reasons which follow.288. First, in outlining his opinion on the issue, Dr Conrad has applied his medical expertise to an assessment of the plaintiff’s care needs. In doing so, his opinion spans a period of some three and a quarter years between 17 February 2006 and 29 May 2009 which is the date of his second report, whereas Ms O’Dwyer’s opinion is anchored at a single point in time, namely 21 February 2008, which was the date of her single examination of the plaintiff.289. Secondly, since Dr Conrad has had the opportunity of seeing the plaintiff on more than just one occasion over this period of time, I consider he has had a considerable clinical advantage over Ms O’Dwyer in making an assessment of the plaintiff’s care needs.290. Thirdly, Dr Conrad has clearly applied his medical knowledge to the problem of assessing the plaintiff’s medical state, her capabilities and her limitations when expressing his opinion on the plaintiff’s care needs. In this regard I consider that his vantage point for making that assessment had greater professional breadth and medical insight than did a non-medical assessment such as that undertaken by Ms O’Dwyer, without intending any criticism or disrespect to her. 291. Fourthly, Dr Conrad’s opinion appears to me to be more holistic in the sense that he carried out his assessment in conjunction with an evaluation of the plaintiff’s potential for residual restricted work fitness, a matter that is, in my view, related to the question of capability for undertaking physical activity that had the potential to cause physical discomfort or pain.292. Fifthly, I feel more able to comfortably rely upon the opinions of Dr Conrad because those opinions have not been relevantly contradicted by any other medical witness who has assessed the plaintiff for the purpose of these proceedings.293. In these circumstances I have concluded that I prefer the opinion of Dr Conrad to that of Ms O’Dwyer on the question of the appropriate estimation of the plaintiff’s need for past domestic assistance. In conjunction with the little evidence the plaintiff gave on the subject of past care, and the evidence given by the plaintiff’s daughter to the effect that she provided more extensive care during the period in question obviously including other family members, I consider that the opinion of Dr Conrad provides the most reliable basis upon which to make an assessment of how much of the care that was actually provided, as was described by the plaintiff’s daughter, as distinct from the degree of care that was actually needed by the plaintiff. I consider that Dr Conrad’s evidence serves as a reliable guide to the evaluation in this regard.294. Accordingly, based upon Dr Conrad’s opinion, I consider the claim for past domestic assistance should be assessed on the basis of 6 hours per week over the period of 185 weeks between 17 February 2006 and the time of the trial. The adjusted amount for this period is $25,563, as calculated in the annexed Table II to my reasons.295. For the foregoing reasons, I reject the plaintiff’s claim for past care in the amount of $81,460 or even the adjusted amount of $94,192. I also reject the defendants’ submission that this care should be assessed in the amount of $19,620. Instead, I allow the aggregate of the amounts in Table I and Table II for the initial 8 months conceded by the defendants but adjusted in the manner I have identified in the sum of $5757, and the amount that I have identified as being the appropriate assessment for the period between 17 February 2006 and the time of the trial, namely, $25,563. These amounts total $31,320. I therefore assess the plaintiff’s entitlement to damages for past domestic assistance, gratuitously provided by family members, in the amount of $31,320.Future domestic assistance296. The plaintiff made a claim for the cost of future domestic assistance. This claim was formulated as being for 8 hours per week over the remainder of the plaintiff’s probable life span of 31 years on the 5 per cent tables (x 833.8) without any discount for any vicissitudes, which yields the sum of $233,465.297. The defendants have submitted that an appropriate allowance for future domestic assistance would be 3.5 hours per week at the rate of $35 per hour over 31 years (x 833.8) but discounted by 5 per cent to reflect submitted likely improvement in the plaintiff’s condition and the independent emergence of care requirements that would arise as a consequence of the ageing process. This calculation yielded the submitted amount of $76,605. 298. The defendants have submitted that the sum allowed for future domestic assistance should be discounted to make an allowance for the consequences of the ageing process in recognition of the fact that the plaintiff had underlying degenerative changes in her spine which may have caused her to have a need for such services in any event. In my view the defendants bear the evidentiary onus for establishing the legitimacy and need for such a discount and, on the evidence in this case, the defendants have failed to adduce that evidence : Watts v Rake [1960] HCA 58; (1960) 108 CLR 158; Purkess v Crittenden [1965] HCA 34; (1965) 114 CLR 164. Accordingly, I decline to apply a discount of the kind submitted by the defendants in the circumstances of this case.299. I consider that the appropriate method by which to assess the plaintiff’s claim for future domestic assistance is to allow 6 hours per week for such assistance at the agreed cost of $35 per hour, which is the equivalent of $210 per week. That approach is based upon and is consistent with my finding by which I have preferred the evidence of Dr Conrad to the evidence of Ms O’Dwyer, but applying the agreed commercial rate for the future loss calculation instead of the statutory rate pursuant to s 128(4) of the MAC Act. In my view there is no basis within the detail or the preponderance of the evidence to allow a discount to reflect the prospect that the plaintiff’s condition may improve.300. Accordingly, the projection of $210 per week at 5 per cent over 31 years (x 833.8) yields the sum of $175,098. In accordance with principle, this sum does not require discount on account of possible adverse vicissitudes. I therefore assess the plaintiff’s entitlement to damages for future domestic assistance in the amount of $175,098.Future treatment301. The plaintiff made a general claim for the cost of future treatment in the global sum of $20,000. This sum was to cover the cost of consultations with general practitioners, physiotherapy and future psychological treatment. This was analysed as being the approximate equivalent of a projection of $25 per week over the plaintiff’s remaining 31 years or probable life span.302. In contrast, the defendants submitted that a buffer amount of $3000 would be a sufficient sum to compensate the plaintiff for her need for future treatment. The defendants support that submission by referring to the minimal treatment incurred by the plaintiff to date. In this regard it was submitted that physiotherapy was only given in the months following the injury, and since then there has been very little in the way of treatment for either the physical or the psychological injuries. 303. In my view there are problems associated with each of these submitted approaches.304. First, neither of the submissions made on behalf of the plaintiff or the defendants take into account the cost of what appears to be a considerable intake of medication. Dr Clark identified the cost of the plaintiff’s need for psychotropic medication at $200 per month. Dr Virgona identified the plaintiff’s intake of Panadeine Forte at between 2 and 6 per day and identified the plaintiff to be taking Stilnox for sleep, Nurofen for pain and diazepam for her back. Neither party has allowed for the cost of any of these medications in their submissions. Apart from Dr Clark’s estimate for psychotropic drugs, no evidence has been adduced as to the cost of these medications. 305. Second, the defendants’ submissions as to the plaintiff’s future treatment costs proceed from a false premise. In submitting that the plaintiff’s future need for physiotherapy should be seen as being unnecessary having regard to the fact that she only received physiotherapy for a few months after her injury, the defendants’ submission fails to have due regard to the unchallenged evidence from within Mr Hewitt’s notes which suggest that physiotherapy treatment, which was medically prescribed, had ceased because the CTP insurer, Allianz, had refused to pay for such treatment. In my view this reveals the defendants’ submissions on future treatment to be afflicted by false assumption and I therefore reject the submission as unreasonable.306. It is clear on the evidence that the plaintiff should be awarded a sum to cover the cost of future treatment. The difficulty is that there is only limited evidence concerning the costing aspects of the plaintiff’s need for future treatment. 307. She obviously needs to see a general practitioner from time to time if for no other reason than to at least renew and supervise her prescriptions for Panadeine Forte and diazepam, if not other medications, and to possibly refer her to other specialists such as a psychiatrist and / or someone such as Dr McCombe. There is no evidence as to the frequency of the need for, or the cost of, such consultations.308. Dr Clark has identified the need for future sessions with a psychiatrist every 2 or 3 weeks for 9 months, at $400 per session. The costing for this item ranges between $5200 and $7800 depending upon which variable is selected. The average of these two alternatives is $6500. 309. I have already identified the lack of basis in the evidence to analyse the true cost of the plaintiff’s need for future medications. Dr Clark has identified the cost of medications at $200 per month. It is not clear as to whether this recommendation refers only to psychotropic medications, or whether it also includes painkilling medications. Further, Dr Clark’s view of the period to be allowed medication costs is open to interpretation, namely, indefinitely or for about 2 years. His recommendation in this regard is expressed ambiguously.310. On the one hand, the medication costs identified by Dr Clark at $200 per month or $46.15 per week, if assumed to be taken indefinitely, when projected at 5 per cent over 31 years (x 833.8) yields the sum of $38,479. On the other hand, if the intention of the recommendation was for 2 years, then $46.15 costed at 5 per cent over 2 years (x 99.4) is $4587. The difference is significant. However, the state of the evidence, and the absence of evidence of the costs of the other medications taken by the plaintiff complicates the task of assessment. Reference to past treatment costs incurred is of no assistance as the total is undifferentiated.311. In view of the paucity of evidence as to the cost of future treatment, rather than speculate on the likely costs I consider that an appropriate conservative buffer to allow the plaintiff the reasonable cost of intermittent medical consultations for review and prescription renewal, possible referrals, possible physiotherapy treatment, consultations with a psychiatrist and a component for recurring medication costs, is an amount of $15,000. I therefore assess the plaintiff’s entitlement to damages for future treatment expenses in the sum of $15,000.Past out-of-pocket expenses312. The plaintiff’s claim for out-of-pocket expenses has been agreed in the sum of $7625. I therefore assess the plaintiff’s damages for out-of-pocket expenses in the sum of $7625.Summary of damages assessment313. My assessment of the Plaintiff’s damages is summarised as follows:

     Judgment 
     
     
      
    1 McCLELLAN CJ at CL: Loi Phouc Dong (Dong) and Thi Dinh Nguyen (Nguyen) and Van Dung Tran (Tran) were found guilty after a trial with a jury that whilst in company of each other detaining Somthanh Chai (Chai) without his consent with the intention to obtain a financial advantage and at the time of that detaining occasioning actual bodily harm to Chai. The offence was contrary to s 86(3) of the Crimes Act 1900 and carries a maximum penalty of 25 years. Dong appealed against his conviction and seeks leave to appeal against his sentence. Both Nguyen and Tran only seek leave to appeal against their sentences. 
     
      
    2 Dong was sentenced to a total term of 8 years imprisonment with a non-parole period of 6 years. Nguyen was sentenced to a total term of 9 years and 2 months imprisonment with a non-parole period of 7 years. Tran was sentenced to a total term of imprisonment of 10 years and 10 months with a non-parole period of 8 years. 
     
      
       
      The evidence at the trial 
       
      
    3 The Crown case was that Nguyen and Tran, assisted by Dong, attempted to kidnap Chai for the purpose of taking a large sum of money which Chai had with him.  
     
      
    4 The Crown alleged that Chai had arranged to meet Tran at St Johns Park Penrith Panthers Club on 5 March 2008. Chai arrived at the agreed location between 10.30 and 11 pm where he met with Tran and they discussed a proposal for Tran to repay a significant sum of money which was owed by Tran to Chai’s employer. Chai was employed as a mobile cheque casher for Fairfield Cash Cheque and for this purpose carried with him significant sums of money. On the night in question he was carrying approximately $10,000. Tran owed Fairfield Cash Cheque an amount of about $30,000 which had accumulated from cheques from third parties which had been given to Tran and which Tran had sought to cash through Chai. 
     
      
    5 When Chai left the Club he opened the door to his motor vehicle, a black Toyota Prado, and sat in the driver’s seat. He was about to close the door when a man whom he later identified as Nguyen ran up to the car pointing a hand gun at Chai’s head. They struggled for control of the gun which was discharged into the air. Two further persons who Chai could not identify came running from the bushes and tried to bundle him into the car. They first tried to push him into the rear passenger seat but this proved difficult due to the presence of a child’s seat. Chai struggled during which time he was punched and kicked. He suffered a cut on his cheek which bled and a cut to his knee which he suffered when he fell onto the bitumen next to his car. 
     
      
    6 Tran was not involved in the attempt to subdue Chai. He remained in the Club house. The struggle between Chai and the others came to an end when a bystander drove into the car park breaking up the group, then driving away. When his assailants left, Chai ran into the Club and was immediately attended to by Tran who asked him: “Are you hurt? Are you being shot? Did they doing anything do you?” 
     
      
    7 The police searched the scene and found a discharged bullet casing as well as a roll of masking tape adjacent to where the black Toyota Prado had been parked in the car park. 
     
      
    8 The Crown tendered evidence of an association between Dong and Nguyen. When the police searched Nguyen’s home they found personal documents belonging to Dong. It was the Crown case that a finger print of Dong was found on the exterior front passenger door of Chai’s car. 
     
      
    9 There was evidence from phone records of conversations between Tran and Nguyen, both prior to and following the incident in the car park. There was no evidence of telephone calls between Dong and Nguyen or with Tran and Chai at any relevant time. 
     
      
    10 Evidence was given by a forensic biologist Ms Lisa Wedervang to the effect that DNA which matched the DNA of Dong had been obtained from the roll of masking tape both on the outside of the tape as well as on part of the inside lip. Ms Vedervang said that the frequency in the general population of the DNA profile found on the tape was fewer than 1 in every 10 billion individuals. Ms Wedervang said that on the side portion of both sides of the tape she identified further DNA profiles that originated from more than 2 individuals, one of which was in a much greater concentration than the other two. She said that Dong could not be excluded as the major contributor to that profile.  
     
      
    11 At the trial counsel for Dong cross-examined Ms Wedervang. She agreed that Dong’s DNA could have been transferred to the roll of tape if he picked it up. She rejected a suggestion that it could have been deposited by Dong merely touching the tape. Counsel interrupted Ms Wedervang when she was in the course of explaining that the amount of DNA recovered was consistent with the tape having been handled rather than just being picked up and put down. Counsel did not return to the subject and asked no further questions of Ms Wedervang about the matter. 
     
      
    12 Dong was interviewed twice by the police. In his interview of 14 November 2007 which was the second interview the answers to questions 70 to 71 and 74 to 81 inclusive are of particular significance. I have set out the questions and answers below: 
     
      
       
        
        “70. Q: We’ve received information that you had in your possession, a roll of tape which was used for the purpose of binding or tying up Mr Chai in some way. What can you tell me about that? 
         
        A: I don’t remember, I don’t know what … I don’t remember. I don’t remember, what, like, where you can find, I don’t remember where it got it from, I don’t know what --- 
        
       
       
        
        71.Q: OK. And we’ve got information that you were in possession of that tape on, that night, on the 5 
        th 
         of March, 2007. What can you say about that? 
         
        A: I don’t know. Nothing to say. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        74. Q: Did you have a thick roll of sticky tape? 
         
        A: I don’t remember, ‘cause I don’t, I don’t remember, like, what, what you guys find it, where you find it but, when you, like, I don’t, I don’t, I have nothing to say, I don’t know where, where they found it or like, like, holding it or something like that. I don’t know. 
        
       
       
        
        75. Q: OK. Have you ever taken any kind of tape or, or that tape or any other kind of tape to the Panthers Club on that day or any other day? 
         
        A: No. No.  
        
       
       
        
        76. Q: Would you have any reason to take any tape with you to the Panthers Club or anywhere else on that day? 
         
        A: No. 
        
       
       
        
        77. Q: Do you own any thick sticky tape? 
         
        A: Um --- 
        
       
       
        
        78. Q: A thick roll of sticky tape? 
         
        A: I, I usually buy like, to stick my magazine … I usually my magazine on the wall like the place I live now, I stick, I sticky tape, just stick on the wall, those magazine, like poster, like that. 
        
       
       
        
        79. Q: Mmm. OK. As a result of the investigation that was conducted and the scientific examination that was conducted of Mr Chai’s car, and the surrounding area, we recovered a roll of thick tape which was located on the ground next to Mr Chai’s black Prado where the offence took place, and that tape has been seized and examined, OK, and a DNA profile has been obtained from that tape, as a result of the examination. This DNA sample from the sticky tape has been analysed and compared to the sample that you provided to us on the 28 
        th 
         of May, OK, and the sample of the DNA on the sticky tape and the same [scil. sample] of DNA that you provided to us, match, and we believe, as a result, that the, the DNA found on the tape belongs to you. What can you tell me about that? 
         
        A: No, I have no idea. No, no. Something, you say something is mine so … 
        
       
       
        
        80. Q: Sorry, what did you say --- 
         
        A: Even --- 
        
       
       
        
        81. Q: --- try to speak up a little bit because you’re mumbling a little bit. 
         
        A: You say, like, you say, you say something is mine, like, so how it have to be mine, just say I do to the shop, I go, I look at the beanie, and, and then I try it on and then I don’t buy it, it’s not nice, I put it back, and then something happen like, oh, with that beanie, someone bought it, do a crime, and then got my hair in it, and then you think it’s me so whatever, like, so IK, that’s it, as, as you say, OK, that’s how it is, so that, I could be happen too, what happen I go to the shop and then I buy some clothes, I try it on, I don’t like it, and then I just put it back, and then, next thing, these people buy it, and then they do a crime, and then got my DNA in it, and then you think it’s me. So could be that. You know, that, all kind of thing that could, you know … it’s all right. I got nothing to say anyway … that’s all I can say to you.” 
        
       
      
    13 Dong gave evidence at the trial in which he denied any knowledge of a plan to kidnap or detain Chai. He explained that he had driven with Nguyen in his mother’s car to the car park area of the Panthers Club. He said that they had gone to the Club for the purpose of purchasing some heroin. He said that he was waiting in his car while Nguyen went somewhere when he heard a loud noise. He said that he went to assist Nguyen who he said was in a struggle with Chai in the vicinity of Chai’s car. He denied having seen Nguyen with a gun before the struggle. 
     
      
    14 Dong said that he tried to prevent Chai from hitting Nguyen and pushed him down after which Chai ran off. He said that he then realised that he had lost his keys and searched for them in the dark near and under Chai’s car. He said that he found some items on the ground but did not know what they were. When he was shown the roll of tape he denied that he had taken it to the car park. He said that he found his own car keys under the car on the passenger seat side. He said that he had touched the car but did not remember where he touched it.  
     
      
    15 In his evidence Dong admitted that he had lived at Nguyen’s home but said it was only for a short time (2 days) earlier that year and before the police search located his personal documents at Nguyen’s house. 
     
      
    16 Dong was cross-examined. He said that after the incident he drove with Nguyen away from the Panther’s Club. Nguyen asked him to stop and said that once he had stopped Nguyen got out of the car but he did not notice where he went.  
     
      
    17 He was asked a series of questions about the DNA identified on the roll of tape, and his fingerprints on the car and his evidence about retrieving his keys. At the end of a series of questions the Crown prosecutor said to Dong: “And that’s the roll of tape that you dropped when you were going from your car to assist Mr Nguyen to kidnap Mr Chai.” Dong denied the suggestion. 
     
      
    18 The prosecutor continued with questions relating to the fingerprint. The Crown prosecutor said: “You touched that part of the door when you were opening it to try and put into the front passenger seat Mr Chai.” Dong answered: “No, I don’t remember.” 
     
      
    19 There were then some further questions in which Dong was asked about his prior statements to the police in which he had denied any knowledge of the Panthers Club. The prosecutor then raised the issue of the roll of tape again and after referring to the answers Dong had given in the police interview said: “And that’s still your evidence is it. You have no way of explaining how your DNA ended up on that roll of tape.” Dong answered: “I had never seen a roll of tape and when I was asked naturally I couldn’t give a satisfactory answer.” 
     
      
    20 When pressed on the matter he said: “It could be that while I was looking for my key and then I…. Touched the car. I could touch the roll of tape which I didn’t take notice and it was too dark …. “ 
     
      
    21 The Crown prosecutor ultimately suggested to Dong that he was carrying the tape with him as part of a plan to kidnap and detain Chai. The prosecutor suggested that it was intended that the tape would be used to tie up Chai’s feet or hands. Dong denied these propositions. 
     
      
       
      Grounds of appeal 
       
      
    22 Dong originally filed a Notice of Appeal in which three grounds were included. However, on the hearing of the appeal only ground 1 was pursued and the other two grounds were abandoned. The ground which was argued was as follows: 
     
      
       
      The appellant received an unfair trial in that the Crown led inadmissible evidence from the police as to the questioning of the appellant regarding his explanation for the DNA result. 
       
      
    23 As I have previously indicated Dong was formally interviewed by the police on two occasions. On the first occasion he denied that he was involved in any attempt to kidnap a person but did admit knowing Nguyen from childhood. He denied any knowledge of the location of the Panthers Club or any knowledge of the incident. 
     
      
    24 During the second interview Dong said that he could not recall what he actually did on 5 March 2007 but denied ever having been to St Johns Panthers Club. However, on this occasion he admitted that he had lived at premises which were occupied by Nguyen in Bonnyrigg around 1 June 2007. He said he lived there for a short period of time. When the police searched Nguyen’s premises they found a citizenship certificate, telephone and internet access banking card belonging to Dong. 
     
      
    25 I have previously related at [12] part of the second interview with Dong. Question 79 includes a statement by the interviewing officer when referring to the DNA material in which he said “the sample of the DNA on the sticky tape and the same [scil. sample] of DNA that you provided to us, match, and we believe, as a result, that the, the DNA found on the tape belongs to you. What can you tell me about that?” 
     
      
    26 There was no objection to this or any other portion of the second interview when it was tendered. 
     
      
    27 Dong submitted that questions 70 and 71 as framed were completely improper in that they presupposed the existence of other evidence which implicated Dong as having possessed the masking tape. It was submitted that no other evidence was led at the trial. It was submitted that because the DNA evidence did not prove as a fact that Dong had actually possessed the tape the questions should have been rejected. It was submitted that the questioning was infected by the “prosecutor’s fallacy.” 
     
      
    28 Apart from the fact that no objection was made to the tender of the questions and answers, counsel for Dong asked no questions of the interviewing officer regarding the Crown’s suggestion of a match between Dong’s DNA and the DNA found on the tape. In his written submissions counsel for Dong acknowledged that as a consequence this Court could conclude that counsel for Dong accepted that the fact of Dong’s DNA being present on the tape was not disputed at the trial. Although counsel who appeared on the appeal submitted that the concession should not have been made there was no suggestion that Dong had been incompetently represented or that the course taken at the trial was adopted for other than legitimate forensic reasons. 
     
      
    29 I have previously referred to the evidence of Ms Vedervang at [11] who said that she believed that the extent of the DNA on the roll of tape was consistent with Dong having handled the tape rather than just picking it up. She was not challenged about the reasons for her belief although counsel did emphasise the possibility of innocent transfer of DNA material to the tape. It was submitted that because of the form of the questions which Dong was asked when he was interviewed and which indicated that the police had concluded that it was his DNA on the tape Dong may have believed that there was no opportunity to challenge this conclusion. It was submitted that this may explain the fact that counsel at the trial did not challenge the evidence that it was Dong’s DNA on the tape. 
     
      
    30 Complaint was also made on the appeal about questions asked of Dong by the Crown prosecutor. The relevant transcript reads as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: I’ll ask you some different questions. Have you got exhibit E there with you still? 
         
        A: INTERPRETER: Yeah. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: That roll of tape, do you understand that there is evidence that is to the effect that you have handled that tape? Your DNA is on that roll of tape? 
         
        A: INTERPRETER: Yes, that’s correct, I did. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: You bought that roll of tape in the car to Panthers Club, didn’t you? 
         
        A: INTERPRETER: No, I didn’t. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q: That’s the roll of tape that has got your DNA on it, hasn’t it? 
         
        A: INTERPRETER: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And that’s the roll of tape that you dropped when you were going from your car to assist Mr Nguyen to kidnap Mr Chai? 
         
        A: INTERPRETER: No.” 
        
       
      
    31 It was submitted to this Court that the prosecutor’s questions were unfair and highly prejudicial in that they not only restated but reinforced the allegedly improper questioning of Dong by the police officer. It was submitted that the impropriety followed from the fact that there was no evidentiary basis to positively assert as a proven fact that it was Dong’s DNA on the masking tape. 
     
      
    32 There was a further occasion in respect of which it was submitted that the prosecutor committed the “prosecutor’s fallacy”; by repeating the allegedly improper question put to Dong by the police. The relevant exchange was as follows: 
     
      
       
        
        “Q: The police in that same interview asked you about exhibit E, the roll of tape. They asked you at question 70 on page 9. ‘We’ve received information that you had in your possession a role (sic) of tape which was used for the purpose of binding or tying up Mr Chai in some way. What can you tell me about that?’ You said, I don’t remember.’ Do you remember that?  
         
        A: INTERPRETER: Yes. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And that’s still your evidence is it, you have no way of explaining how your DNA ended up on that roll of tape? 
         
        A: INTERPRETER: I had never seen the roll of tape and when I was asked naturally I couldn’t give a satisfactory answer. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Can I suggest the truth is that the DNA on that roll of tape because you were handling it at the time Mr Nguyen, your friend was struggling with Mr Chai and you dropped it as you were going to his assistance. That’s the satisfactory answer, isn’t it? 
         
        A: INTERPRETER: … (not transcribable) … satisfactory answer, it could be that while I was looking for my key and then … (not transcribable) … I touched the car. I could touch the roll of tape which I didn’t take notice and it was too dark. I was given the chance to view the photograph but that’s not the real thing at what happened at the time. It was much darker. It has such a lighting as in the photo. 
        
       
       
        
        Q: Mr Dong, you had that tape with you as part of a plan that you, Mr Tran, seated over there, the accused, Mr Tran, and your friend, Mr Nguyen, the other accused, had to kidnap, detain in that car, Mr Chai, isn’t that the truth? 
         
        A: INTERPRETER: No. 
        
       
       
        
        … 
        
       
       
        
        Q: And you were supposed to use the tape to tie up Mr Chai’s feet or his hands? 
         
        A: INTERPRETER: To do what to Mr Chai? Can you say it again? 
        
       
       
        
        CROWN PROSECUTOR 
         
        Q: Tie the feet or the hands? 
         
        A: INTERPRETER: No.” 
        
       
      
    33 It was submitted to this Court that it was quite unfair and prejudicially so to put any question to an accused when giving evidence to explain why it is his or her DNA on any object. It was said to be a reversal of proof. It was submitted that the question presupposes that there is proof that the DNA which has been found is that of the accused, whereas DNA evidence does not constitute proof that it was that individual’s DNA, merely that there is a statical probability that it is his or her DNA. It was submitted that the form of questions reversed the onus of proof so that Dong was being required to explain something that was beyond his knowledge. It was further submitted that the problem was compounded by the trial judge’s summing up because no direction was given as to the use that could be made of Dong’s evidence on this matter. 
     
      
       
      Conclusion with respect to the ground of appeal 
       
      
    34 As I previously indicated trial counsel took no objection to either the tender of the relevant portion of the police interview or the questions asked by the Crown prosecutor. 
     
      
    35 During the course of the police interview it was suggested to Dong that the police had information that he had a roll of tape in his possession at the relevant time. This was true and all that Dong was initially asked was “what can you tell me about that.” The questioning police officer suggested that the intended use of the tape was to bind or tie Chai, an inference which the police were reasonably entitled to draw. 
     
      
    36 Later in the questioning the officer indicated that the police believed that the DNA found on the tape belonged to Dong. This was the police belief and it was held on reasonable grounds. The question which was asked provided Dong a further opportunity to explain his position with respect to the belief which the police held. There was no impropriety involved. 
     
      
    37 As far as the questions asked during the trial are concerned I am also satisfied that there was no impropriety or unfairness to Dong. The prosecutor indicated that there was evidence that Dong had handled the tape and that his DNA was on it. This was the evidence and the question had a reasonable foundation. Dong admitted that he had handled the tape but denied that he had brought it to the Panthers Club. 
     
      
    38 Although later in the cross-examination Dong said he had never seen the roll of tape, this was inconsistent with his earlier answer that he had handled it. However, the Crown prosecutor proceeded to put to Dong that his DNA came to be on the tape because he had held it during the struggle with Chai. It was this proposition which Dong ultimately denied. 
     
      
    39 It is plain that Dong’s defence at his trial accepted that his DNA had been found on the tape. Although he denied that he had held the tape or was carrying it at the Panthers Club he did not deny that he had touched it. He accepted that he had handled the tape but denied that he had carried it for the purpose of using it to bind Chai. 
     
      
    40 For these reasons I reject the submission that the trial of Dong was unfair. There was no suggestion that counsel was incompetent or failed to act in accordance with Dong’s instructions. A forensic choice was plainly made which accepted that Dong’s DNA was present on the tape, the argument being confined to the circumstances in which it came to be there. The appeal against his conviction should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Matters of sentence 
       
      
    41 The primary challenge to the sentences which the trial judge imposed was brought by Tran who received the most severe sentence. The sentences for Nguyen and Dong were imposed by the sentencing judge having regard to her findings that the offence was motivated by Tran who she identified as the leader in the implementation of the plan to detain Chai.  
     
      
    42 Tran advanced four grounds of appeal being as follows: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1 Her Honour erred by having additional regard as an aggravating factor to the fact that the offence was committed in company. 
       
       
      Ground 2 Her Honour erred by having additional regard as an aggravating factor to the actual use of violence. 
       
       
      Ground 3 Her Honour erred by having additional regard as an aggravating factor to the fact that the offence was committed for financial gain. 
       
       
      Ground 4 Her Honour erred by having regard as an aggravating factor to the applicant’s record of previous convictions. 
       
      
    43 The sentencing judge determined that Tran’s role was “around the middle range of objective seriousness.” Although it was submitted that her Honour could make a finding of special circumstances she declined to do so. 
     
      
    44 It was submitted to the sentencing judge that she should find that Nguyen did not bring the gun to the scene but that it was produced by Chai. It was further argued for Nguyen that as there was no element of the offence that he was armed with a gun the jury did not have to and it could be assumed did not make a finding beyond reasonable doubt that he brought the gun. The sentencing judge did not accept this submission. Her Honour accepted the evidence of Chai and found that it was Nguyen who brought the gun to the scene. 
     
      
    45 Her Honour set out her findings as to the relevant the facts. She stated: 
     
      
       
        
        ""In dealing firstly with the offender  
        Tran 
        , in looking to the objective seriousness of the offence I am mindful of the factors to be taken into consideration as are set out in  
        R v Collett  
        CCA 7 June 1979 and in  
        R v Newell  
        2004 CCA. 
        
       
       
        
        Though not exhaustive these factors include: 
        
       
       
        
        The length of time the victim was detained. 
        
       
       
        
        The extent of fear or terror of the victim and the purpose of the detention. 
        
       
       
        
        Whether there are persons who are subjected to anguish and fear for the wellbeing of the person detained. 
        
       
       
        
        Clearly the last factor does not apply in this situation. 
        
       
       
        
        In this case the detention period was very short. It appears to have been somewhere around one minute or so. The victim was clearly distressed. This was very obvious from the video footage and the evidence of those who attended to him at the Club. The evidence given by the police and ambulance officers was also to that effect. 
        
       
       
        
        It does not appear he was seriously injured and he declined to go to hospital. There is no evidence that he required further medical attention. 
        
       
       
        
        A Victim Impact Statement was tendered which showed him to continue to experience some effects of the detention. However, as I have said, there is no medical evidence of a requirement for attention or for continuing treatment. I accept it however to have been a frightening experience for him and that he does continue to experience some sequelae from the event. 
        
       
       
        
        From the jury verdict it is clear they accepted the offenders did detain Chai to obtain a financial advantage. 
        
       
       
        
        The Crown submits the offence is at the higher end of the range of objective seriousness noting the offence was part of a planned criminal activity and involved actual use of a weapon, was committed without regard for public safety, and involved a grave risk of death to another person or persons. I do not accept that last submission. No other person appears to have been threatened or appeared likely to have been threatened, although I accept the offence was committed without regard for public safety, noting that there were patrons present at the club and there were other vehicles in the car park. 
        
       
       
        
        Counsel for Tran submits that I should find this to be within the mid range of objective seriousness. 
        
       
       
        
        In looking to aggravating factors, clearly the offence included actual or threatened use of violence and of a weapon. 
        
       
       
        
        The offender has a record of previous convictions and has spent lengthy periods in gaol. The offences for which he has been previously committed include a conviction for manslaughter in May 1999 for which he received a four years three months sentence with a one year five month additional sentence. Multiple offences of PCA and other driving offences are noted on his record, as is a conviction for demanding property with menaces in November 1997. 
        
       
       
        
        The offence was committed in company and without regard for public safety. 
        
       
       
        
        The offence was part of planned or organised criminal activity evidenced by the phone calls made by Tran to Chai and Nguyen. 
        
       
       
        
        The offence was committed for financial gain. 
        
       
       
        
        I find those aggravating factors to be present beyond reasonable doubt"". 
        
       
       
      Subjective matters in relation to Tran 
       
       
      
    46 The applicant both gave and called evidence relevant to his sentence. He was supported in court by his extended family including his mother and cousins. 
     
      
    47 At the date of sentence he was forty-three years old and was married with five children the youngest of which was aged fifteen years. His wife suffers from a depressive illness. 
     
      
    48 He was born in Vietnam where he attended school before he left with two brothers travelling to Malaysia where he spent 12 months in a detention camp before arriving in Australia in 1981 at age sixteen or seventeen. He completed year ten at school and then worked in a clothing factory. He was married in 1985. 
     
      
    49 Her Honour noted that the applicant agreed that he has experienced prior problems with alcohol. He admitted his prior offences but her Honour believed that he sought to downplay them, saying that the manslaughter of his brother was an accident.  
     
      
    50 Members of the applicant's family gave evidence that they regarded him as the pillar of their family, a good person and a good father. However her Honour concluded that their views must be treated with some caution because, in the main, they were unaware of the nature of this offence except in vague terms.  
     
      
    51 Her Honour found that the applicant continued to demonstrate a disregard for the law. She emphasised that he admits that he still owes Chai $30 000 and has other large debts including some $50 000 to Cash-a-Cheque. 
     
      
    52 Tran’s complaint is that her Honour adopted a “check list” approach to the matters referred to in s 21A of the Crimes Sentencing Procedure Act with the consequence that she has effectively double counted in respect of the fact that the offence was committed in company (ground 1) and for financial gain (ground 3).  
     
      
    53 In my judgment this submission must be accepted. The concluding paragraphs in her remarks with respect to Tran which I have set out in [46] make plain that her Honour viewed these matters as matters of aggravation when they were clearly an element of the offence. By having regard to these matters as aggravating factors her Honour has proceeded contrary s 21A(2) of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act.  
     
      
    54 In relation to ground 2 Tran submitted that her Honour had also erred by concluding that the offence was aggravated by the actual or threatened use of violence and of a weapon. However, the offence even in its specially aggravated form does not include an element of violence or the use of a weapon. In its specially aggravated form actual bodily harm must be occasioned to the victim but this need not be as a result of the use of violence or the presence of a weapon. In the present case this aspect of the offence was of particular significance. Her Honour found that Nguyen was carrying a gun which was discharged during the course of the events. Fortunately no one was injured by the bullet but given the melee that was occurring the possibility of really serious harm being occasioned to Chai or one of the other two or a bystander was significant. Her Honour was entitled to have regard to this aspect as a serious aggravating factor. 
     
      
    55 With respect to ground 4 Tran submitted that her Honour’s reference to Tran’s record of previous convictions makes plain that her Honour erred by considering this to be an aggravating factor. It was submitted that the relevance of an offender’s previous convictions is confined by the principles stated in R v McNaughton [2006] NSWCCA 242; (2006) 66 NSWLR 566 where it was stated that a record of previous convictions is not relevant to the objective seriousness of an offence. It may however require that greater weight be given to retribution, personal deterrence and the protection of the community than would be the case if such a record did not exist. 
     
      
    56 It is apparent from the sequence of matters referred to in her Honour’s remarks on sentence that she considered Tran’s prior convictions to be relevant as an “aggravating factor” in the offence. This was plainly an error: see McNaughton at 573-574. 
     
      
    57 Notwithstanding the errors identified in the sentencing process for Tran it is necessary to consider whether or not the sentence which her Honour imposed was such that this Court should intervene (s 6(1) Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. This was a very serious offence significantly aggravated by the use of a loaded gun. A significant penalty was inevitable. The maximum penalty for the offence is imprisonment for 25 years. The sentence was required to reflect both general and personal deterrence. The courts must do what they can to dissuade members of the community from endeavouring to kidnap others for financial gain, particularly when the enterprise contemplates the use of a loaded weapon which may be discharged either deliberately or indiscriminately in the melee which is likely to accompany the confrontation. The sentencing judge found that Tran instigated the offence which was committed because of the financial liabilities which Tran had incurred and was attempting to alleviate. 
     
      
    58 When appropriate regard is given to Tran’s personal circumstances I am not persuaded that a lesser sentence than that which the sentencing judge imposed is required. Notwithstanding the fact that Tran is married with 5 children he has lived an irresponsible life. He has previously been convicted and sentenced for the manslaughter of his brother. Although this conviction does not aggravate the seriousness of the present offence it nevertheless suggests a significant need to impose a sentence which provides appropriately for personal deterrence and the need for the protection of the community. 
     
      
    59 Although I would grant leave to appeal I would dismiss Tran’s appeal against his sentence. No other sentence was required by law. 
     
      
       
      Application for leave to appeal against sentence by Nguyen 
       
      
    60 Nguyen sought to advance 3 grounds of appeal which are as follows: 
     
      
       
      Ground 1: The sentence imposed upon the co-offender Tran was infected with error such as to cause the sentencing exercise in the applicant’s case to miscarry. 
       
       
      Ground 2: Her Honour erred in that she had additional regard, as an aggravating factor, to a matter that was an element of the offence namely, the use of violence. 
       
       
      Ground 3: Her Honour erred in that she took into account as an aggravating factor a matter that was specified in the offence namely, that the offence was committed for financial gain. 
       
      
    61 In effect the grounds of appeal are the same as those advanced by Tran and for the reasons I have already given in respect to Tran’s application for leave to appeal the sentencing process in respect of Nguyen was also flawed. However, it is again necessary to consider whether any lesser sentence was required in law.  
     
      
       
      Subjective matters in relation to Nguyen 
       
      
    62 The applicant’s subjective case was placed before the court in a report by Dr Katie Seidler. 
     
      
    63 At the date of sentence the applicant was 26 years of age, having been born on 23 October 1981 in a small town in northern Vietnam, the middle of three children. The applicant’s father had served in the Vietnam War and had died when the applicant was only a young child. 
     
      
    64 The applicant’s mother came to Australia when he was six years old. She took the applicant’s siblings with her to Australia although she left the applicant with his paternal grandparents. The applicant was uncertain why this had happened but told the psychologist that he felt rejected by his mother and unwanted. He had lived with his paternal grandparents for six years and became very attached to them. His grandparents were elderly and he was the only child in the home and he felt quite isolated. 
     
      
    65 He was brought to Australia in 1993 when he was 12 years of age and found the adjustment to living in Australia a difficult one. His grandparents remained in Vietnam. He told Ms Seidler that he found the cultural and language differences very difficult and had found it hard to relate to his mother and siblings who by this time were settled in Australia and were more proficient in English than he was. He had felt distant and disconnected from his family. From the age of 13 he led what Ms Seidler described as an unstructured and itinerant lifestyle alternating between living with friends or “on the streets”. He drifted into what Ms Seidler described as an anti-social peer culture. Whilst he had attempted to live back with his family at various times these were generally unsuccessful. 
     
      
    66 Nguyen was first taken into custody at the age of 14 and had spent approximately 7 years in custody since that time. He commenced using drugs and alcohol at the age of 14. He started drinking alcohol heavily and also smoking cannabis. He quickly developed a dependence, smoking approximately 100 “cones” each day. He told Ms Seidler that he had suffered visual hallucinations and paranoid ideation as a result. He started using ecstasy at about the age of 16 and heroin at the age of 18 to 20 years of age. He stopped smoking cannabis as his use of harder drugs increased. 
     
      
    67 Nguyen has been heroin dependent since the age of 18. He acknowledged to Ms Seidler that his drug use was problematic. He had initially been exposed to drugs through a negative peer group influence but over time Ms Seidler noted that he used drugs heavily in an attempt to forget about his personal problems and to avoid what she described as a “negative affect.” He had been a slow learner and had repeated Year 1 and Year 2 in Vietnam. Although he started Year 6 studies in Australia, he was taken out of a mainstream school and placed in a remedial English class to assist him in gaining sufficient language skills to cope with school. He dropped out of school in Year 9. 
     
      
    68 Nguyen’s employment history is relatively short. He was first employed at the age of 17 in the tiling business helping a friend and had also had employment as a kitchen hand. His drug use had been a problem in maintaining employment. 
     
      
    69 Dr Seidler concluded that “the appellant’s offending behaviour is best understood in the context of early psycho-social vulnerabilities, an unsuccessful experience of migration, and negative peer influence.” She noted that whilst he had struggled with itinerancy, instability, drug use and anti-social peer influence for some years, and whilst he gained some perspective and motivation for change when in custody and drug-free, he soon relapsed. She suggested that he would benefit from intervention and support in order to assess an appropriate approach to his rehabilitation. 
     
      
    70 The applicant has a number of prior convictions. These commenced in 1998 with a charge of resist an officer in the execution of his duty and using offensive language. Thereafter, he has entries as a juvenile for offences of resisting an officer and possessing a prohibited drug and a goods in custody offence. His first adult entry was for supplying a prohibited drug, being a small quantity for which he was sentenced to prison for 6 months. Subsequently he was convicted of robbery in company for which he received a sentence of 2 years 3 months with a 15 month non-parole period. Her Honour incorrectly noted that sentence as being one of “two years plus an extra term of fifteen months from 28 March 2002.” Since being released he has committed two driving offences. 
     
      
    71 As with Tran I am satisfied that no lesser sentence than that which her Honour imposed was appropriate. Notwithstanding the errors which her Honour made when sentencing Tran this was a very serious offence. Her Honour found that it was Nguyen who was carrying the gun when Chai was accosted and Nguyen who fired the shot. The fact that it was Nguyen who took a gun to the scene significantly raises the seriousness of the offence. To my mind a more significant sentence than her Honour imposed would not have been an error. There is nothing in Nguyen’s personal circumstances which would indicate that a more lenient sentence should have been imposed. 
     
      
    72 Although I would grant leave to appeal, Nguyen’s appeal against sentence should be dismissed. 
     
      
       
      Application for leave to appeal against sentence by Dong 
       
      
    73 The application by Dong for leave to appeal his sentence was confined to a submission that her Honour should have made a finding of special circumstances pursuant to s 44 of the Crimes (Sentencing Procedure) Act. Dong accepted that her Honour correctly identified that his role in the offence justified a lesser sentence than was imposed upon either Tran or Nguyen. Furthermore, Dong’s counsel made no submission that her Honour’s finding as to the seriousness of the offence was erroneous. Apart from joining in a submission that her Honour erred when sentencing Tran and Nguyen with the consequence that Dong’s sentence should for the same reasons be reduced it was submitted that her Honour fell into error when she failed to make a finding of special circumstances. It was submitted that Dong’s relative youth (he was aged 26 at the time of sentencing), the struggle that he had with drug addiction and the need for rehabilitation meant that her Honour should have provided a greater period on parole to allow for his rehabilitation and adjustment to society. 
     
      
    74 The Crown submitted that the sentence which her Honour imposed allowed for a sufficient period on parole. It was submitted that Dong’s circumstances were not sufficiently “special” to have justified a finding of special circumstances: R v Fidow [2004] NSWCCA 172 at [18]-[20]. It was submitted that Dong was not young at the time and his record of prior offending, including an offence of armed robbery, and the fact that he was on a s 9 bond for an offence of possessing stolen goods at the time he committed the offence indicated that he was prepared to continue to break the law. It was submitted that in the circumstances there was nothing to indicate that Dong would benefit from an extended period of supervision upon his release. 
     
      
    75 This Court has previously indicated that a finding of special circumstances is a matter which falls within the discretion of a sentencing judge: see Clarke v R [2009] NSWCCA 49 at [13]; R v Cramp [2004] NSWCCA 264 at [31]. I am not persuaded that her Honour has erred in the exercise of her discretion in the present case. In any event, I would not myself have made a finding of special circumstances. There is no doubt that if Dong is ever to become a responsible member of the community he must understand that he has to address his tendency for criminal behaviour and his use of prohibited drugs. However, he has previously received opportunities to alter his behaviour which, as the present offence indicates, he has failed to utilise. 
     
      
    76 Although I would grant leave to Dong to appeal against his sentence I would dismiss that appeal. No other sentence was required by law. 
     
      
    77 Accordingly the orders I propose are: 
     
      
       
      1. Appeal by Dong against his conviction dismissed. 
       
      2. Leave to appeal their sentences is granted to Tran, Nguyen and Dong but each appeal is dismissed. 
       
      
    78 HOWIE J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL. 
     
      
    79 ROTHMAN J: I agree with McClellan CJ at CL.
